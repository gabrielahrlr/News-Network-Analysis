{"Is it time to revisit the storied debate over tennis' schedule?": "Seasons in all sports can be very long (just ask Seattle Mariners or Philadelphia 76ers fans). As LeBron James said last June of the 82-game schedule that preceded the NBA's two-month postseason: \"It's too long. There are too many games, too many road trips.\"\n\nYeah, well, try tennis, LeBron.\n\nWhile the NBA joins other sports with particularly long seasons (including spring training, there's an 8\u00bd month slog for the World Series teams in baseball and a September-to-June stretch for NHL Cup-winning teams), professional tennis schedules can span from January through November.\n\nThe first matches of the 2015 season were the first full week of January in Australia, India, China, New Zealand and Qatar. The last match wasn't until the Davis Cup finals last week. Nor does it include training periods. Portugal's Joao Sousa played 34 tournaments in 18 countries, competing in Miami and St. Petersburg, Russia, along with Auckland, Dubai; Shanghai; and Mason, Ohio.\n\nWorn-out players can only hope Antarctica never hosts a tournament in December.\n\nSerena Williams cut her season short in 2015, withdrawing from the season-ending WTA Finals and China Open 'to take time to heal' after playing through injuries all season. Pascal Guyot/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"Sousa is not playing well this match.\"\n\n\"No surprise there. Ice is not his favorite surface. And I think he just wants to get off the court and into the locker room to warm up.\"\n\nIs a 10- to 11-month season too long for athletes? Does it allow for enough rest? Does it take too much of a toll, physically and mentally? These aren't new questions for debate. As Martina Navratilova said during a news conference at the WTA Finals in Singapore that ended Nov. 1, \"I was talking about that 35, 30 years ago. The season is too long.\"\n\n\"You have to push yourself,\" said former pro player and current ESPN television analyst Mary Joe Fernandez. \"It's inevitable that we'll see these women at the end of the year and they'll have tape everywhere. It is important to take one or two breaks within the season.\"\n\nAnd to think that some people criticized Serena Williams for calling it a season after the US Open, especially when her coach said there is almost no cartilage left in her knees. And if LeBron thinks the NBA season is too draining, he should consider the additional stress tennis players cope with when booking all their own flights and lodging just to arrive at an event.\n\n\"LeBron and players are some of the finest athletes that we have, and you think about what they're asked to do -- they're asked to play 82 games, and they average 36-40 minutes a game. And they struggle sometimes playing back to back,\" Women's Tennis Association CEO Steve Simon recently told ESPN.com. \"And we're asking the tennis players to play three weeks on and a week off or two weeks on. And if they're a good player of LeBron's caliber, within our tournaments, that means they will play 15 nights out of 21, playing 2\u00bd hours a night, at the highest level, without any substitutions. Think of the effect on the athlete's body every day without any substitutes.\n\n\"It can definitely be very challenging on an athlete's body, and it shows the wear and tear and why appropriate rest is a very important element that we have to create a structure that provides for it.\"\n\nNot all players play an entire tournament -- half are knocked out in the first round. But that doesn't always mean the rest of the tournament is free. Many play doubles, which extends the workload.\n\nLucie Safarova played almost every day of this year's French Open, reaching the finals in singles and winning the doubles title (her partner, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, won the mixed doubles title, as well). Safarova said she enjoyed it immensely. But after having won doubles at the first two Grand Slams of the year, plus in Stuttgart, Germany, she won only one more doubles title the rest of the season (in Toronto) and reached the singles final at only one more tournament. That was in New Haven, Connecticut, where she also developed an injury. She lost in the first round of singles play at the US Open and withdrew from doubles competition.\n\nHow much of that was simply a case of injuries happening as they do in life and sports, and how much of it might have been influenced by the long season? Difficult to say, but there were an alarming number of retirements on the WTA circuit this fall. Jeff Sackmann of TennisAbstract.com says that over the past decade, retirements from WTA events have averaged around 3 percent post-US Open. That might not sound like a lot, but it's 25 percent higher than the rate before the US Open. Sackmann also noted that retirement rates are about double what they were in the 1990s.\n\n\"I think what we have to look at is not necessarily the length [of the season] but how do we structure [it] ... I don't have the answer today, but we're going to get right after it, because it's not something that should drag on.\" Women's Tennis Association CEO Steve Simon\n\n\"I think that some players, in an effort to gain as many points as they can, enter more tournaments than they probably should and do suffer minor injuries as a result,\" he said. \"However, a huge factor is that, as the game has become more and more competitive, players are training harder than ever before, pushing their bodies to the edge just to keep pace with the field. Whether someone plays 15 tournaments or 30, that sort of aggressive training regimen is going to result in more midmatch retirements.\"\n\nThat last stretch of schedule to Singapore can be a long one -- Kristina Mladenovic followed the Open with a tournament in Tokyo, three in China and one in Moscow before arriving at the WTA Finals. On the men's side, Sousa followed the US Open with seven tournaments -- two in Russia, plus one each in Portugal, Malaysia, Japan, China and Spain.\n\nOne change Simon says he would like to quickly pursue for 2016 is flopping the WTA Finals and the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai, China -- thereby holding the Finals after Zhuhai so players qualifying late for the Finals would have an extra week to rest, recover or get treatment, if needed.\n\nWhile Simon doesn't think it will be possible to shorten the season, he says officials can potentially rework the schedule so players will have more added time to rest in between some tournaments.\n\nWhatever the season schedule, ESPN analyst and coach Brad Gilbert says another key is for players to pace themselves throughout the year.\n\n\"Andre [Agassi] is the one who really started it, and [Roger Federer] has taken it to a new level,\" he said. \"It's figuring out during the year how to pace yourself, which helps your longevity.\"\n\nOf course, that's easier to do when you're winning a lot. When you're not, there is a need to play more and give yourself more chances to win. The ranking system also encourages players to keep playing as much as possible, Fernandez says, adding that the top players average more tournaments now.\n\nLook at Sousa. After competing in 34 tournaments in 18 countries and four continents, Sousa finally won a tournament by beating Roberto Bautista Agut 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 at the Valencia Open in November. It was his first title in two years. Although his final match victory might have been due in part to Bautista Agut playing an exhausting match the night before when he beat Steve Johnson 4-6. 6-3, 7-6 (8).\n\n\"The match last night finished very late, and that affected me physically,\" Bautista Agut told reporters after the final match. \"It's been a very long season, and by the last set, I was dead.\"\n\nBautista Agut then traveled to Paris for his opening match in the Paribas Masters two days later.\n\nThe question is what can be done. As Gilbert points out, unlike in most other sports, there is no league commissioner overseeing everything in tennis. There is the ATP, WTA, ITF, plus the Grand Slams, Fed Cup and Davis Cup. And just to make things more complicated, in 2016, there are the Olympics in Brazil. And with tennis being a global sport, there are many cities in many countries hosting tournaments.\n\nThat's a lot to coordinate.\n\n\"I think what we have to look at is not necessarily the length [of the season] but how do we structure [it] so that there is appropriate rest during the course of it,\" Simon said. \"The players want to play the number of tournaments they play, but we have to look at it where the season becomes compressed and they don't have proper rest, which obviously leads to injury.\n\n\"It's an open book right now. That's one of my challenges here, to get in and look at it. I don't have the answer today, but we're going to get right after it because it's not something that should drag on.\"", "Eric Bledsoe of Phoenix Suns to miss rest of season": "PHOENIX -- The Suns say leading scorer Eric Bledsoe will not return this season after undergoing surgery Tuesday to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee.\n\nThe team made the announcement in a brief news release, saying Bledsoe's \"prognosis is for a return to full playing status for the start of training camp next fall.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old point guard was injured in the team's home loss to Philadelphia on Saturday.\n\nCoach Jeff Hornacek had speculated before Monday's game against Cleveland that Bledsoe would be sidelined about six weeks. General manager Ryan McDonough had said only that he hoped Bledsoe would return at some point this season.\n\nEric Bledsoe was enjoying a career year for the Suns. Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nThat all changed with Tuesday's surgery.\n\n\"I've had a meniscus done,\" Hornacek said Tuesday. \"They can either repair it or cut it out. Repairing is probably the best thing to happen. You're out longer but it's the best thing for your joint and knee.\"\n\nBledsoe appeared in 31 games this season, averaging 20.4 points and 6.1 assists per game. He has averaged 17.9 points in 155 games in parts of three seasons with the Suns since coming in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nIt is the third significant knee injury in Bledsoe's six-year NBA career. He underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee in 2011 and had the right meniscus removed in January 2014.\n\nWhile Bledsoe missed 2\u00bd months of play after his 2014 surgery, he returned to appear in 81 games last season, averaging 17 points, 6.1 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game.\n\nBledsoe signed a five-year, $70 million contract just before the start of last season.\n\nHe teamed with Goran Dragic in a double-point-guard system in the 2013-14 season, when the Suns won 48 games and narrowly missed the playoffs. McDonough brought in a third point guard, Isaiah Thomas, before last season, and the glut of playmakers failed to work as hoped. Dragic and Thomas were traded away at the trade deadline. But the deals brought another point guard, Brandon Knight, to Phoenix.\n\nThis season, Bledsoe and Knight had teamed in the double-point-guard approach.\n\nThe injury means the team will return to a more conventional system with a point guard and an off guard. Rookie Devin Booker started at the off guard position in Phoenix's loss to Cleveland on Monday night.\n\n\"It could be good for us in the long run,\" Hornacek said. \"It will give some of these guys more opportunity to play and get better, some of our young guys and that will be good for them.\"\n\nThe bad news on Bledsoe's injury came with the Suns mired in a five-game losing streak. Phoenix has lost 16 of 21 games going into Wednesday night's contest at San Antonio.\n\nIn a shake-up of Hornacek's staff, the team fired assistant coaches Mike Longabardi and Jerry Sichting on Monday.", "Man United and Chelsea play out frustrating scoreless draw": "David De Gea and Thibaut Courtois were the heroes on the night, in a match that ended 0-0 thanks to their stellar goalkeeping.\n\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes his side dominated the match and deserved to win against Chelsea.\n\nMan United captain Wayne Rooney insists that his side will return to fighting form eventually after a 0-0 against Chelsea.\n\nChelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink reacts to his side's goalless draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford.\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin states the obvious after United fall short of a win against Chelsea.\n\nThree quick thoughts from Man United's 0-0 draw with Chelsea in the Premier League at Old Trafford on Monday.\n\n1. United, Chelsea draw a blank\n\nIf this was the last time Louis van Gaal manages Manchester United, there was delicious irony in the scoreline. A seventh 0-0 of the season best reflects the troubled and almost certainly doomed reign of the ailing Dutch master.\n\nChelsea, themselves mortally wounded amid their own wreck of a season, were able to ride out some early United pressure and eventually force some of their own chances, with Nemanja Matic missing the best of all in the 61st minute.\n\nManchester United Manchester United Chelsea Chelsea 0 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nFrom there, two malfunctioning units eventually ground out a stalemate, but Van Gaal must have cursed his luck when both Juan Mata and Anthony Martial struck the woodwork in the early stages, with Old Trafford's home contingent roaring in encouragement. At that point, it looked like Van Gaal had released his players from his tactical cage and allowed them to take risks in attacking positions.\n\nWayne Rooney, who played with something approaching the buzz of old, even rediscovered his long-range shooting boots with a 25th-minute rocket that warmed the hands of Thibaut Courtois. Shots on target? Whatever next?\n\nUnited were still bereft of confidence in front of goal, and Rooney, with Martial marooned out left, swiftly became an isolated figure at centre-forward, usually in too much traffic when receiving the ball. Behind him, Bastian Schweinsteiger's and Morgan Schneiderlin's ponderousness put a brake on the quick attacks that United fans craved from their team, and Ander Herrera, a leading light in Monday's bright start, got bogged down in midfield skirmishes that brought a raft of bookings.\n\nMan United had several chances to grab all three points before being forced to settle for a dissatisfying 0-0 draw.\n\nWhen Chelsea began the second half much the brighter, United's confident beginnings seemed likely to become a memory, but then came another thwarted revival. Thibaut Courtois' chest stopped a goal-bound Herrera effort in the 55th minute. A team that has forgotten how to score was headed for another blank, a plight confirmed by Rooney's late skewed volley of an inviting cross by substitute Cameron Borthwick-Jackson when the goal was positively at his mercy.\n\nIt left United winless in their last eight games across all competitions.\n\n2. Van Gaal signs off?\n\nIs Louis a lame duck? It certainly seemed so. Right now, he's a manager who admitted on Boxing Day that he had considered deserting his post, oversees a team that no longer seems to respond to him and is beset by a fan base riven by doubt. Beyond all that, he tried to function within a club hierarchy that appears unable to make up its mind about what to do next.\n\nHad United execs been more decisive, Jose Mourinho might well have been strategising United's approach against his old team. As it was, with Chelsea's former manager taking in some winter sun before his next move is revealed, his face instead starred on some unofficial United scarves. An opportunistic \"swag man\" had either jumped the gun or was predicting the future, but Chelsea fans did not have to go through the pain of seeing their loved one in another's arms. Instead, they happily regaled their fallen hero in song throughout.\n\nFor his part, Van Gaal took to the bench with a look of reluctance. As he walked down the sideline to a smattering of supportive applause, he looked straight down the camera tracking his every step. \"This is Manchester United, a club that is known around the world for never being beaten,\" his programme notes had read, and his team did begin with notable defiance.\n\nWhen Mata, a player for whom Mourinho coming in would probably be bad news, struck the crossbar in the second minute, Old Trafford swelled with expectation. Many United fans may hope for a change of management, but they still want their heroes to win.\n\nThen came a Daley Blind slip and Ashley Young's desperate clearance of Eden Hazard's cross to remind fans of the defensive problems that have contributed heavily to United and Van Gaal's slide from grace. It was a nervous evening all round, and Young, a left-winger-turned-left-back now playing at right-back, exhibited some fine last-ditch defending.\n\nChelsea defended brightly enough but will also rue several glorious missed opportunities.\n\nVan Gaal continued his form of never raising himself from his cushioned seat in the Old Trafford dugout, making typically copious notes on what was occurring in front of him. Despite a performance that was a significant improvement from the dirges delivered this season and some vocal support from fans, many will hope that those scribblings contained a resignation note.\n\n3. Chelsea appear more relaxed\n\nCan the second time around be just as good? Guus Hiddink's return as a diamond-plated caretaker manager sees him granted a task far beyond his February 2009 assignment, when he took over a team sitting fourth in the table. Seven seasons on, he is leading a team who started their 19th game of the league season just two points above the relegation zone.\n\nIt's of course a preposterous situation for the Premier League's defending champions. Hiddink has stepped in as the chilled-out uncle to Mourinho the divisive control freak, and Chelsea's players did look to be enjoying greater freedom of expression, though some lax passing helped set up United's more dangerous moments of the first half.\n\nDiego Costa's untimely suspension, a self-inflicted wound just as he hit form with two goals against Watford, robbed Chelsea of an attacking counterpoint. It means that despite being barely fit after the hip injury that caused one final bust-up with Mourinho on Dec. 14, Hazard was the furthest forward. Though he chased plenty of shadows in search of possession, he clearly enjoyed his newfound freedom. A couple of body swerves had United defenders flailing, and the Belgian's link-up with Pedro (who turned down United to join Chelsea in August) was the most obvious danger to United.\n\nIt was their combination that forced David De Gea into a world-class save at the beginning of the second half, while Hiddink will have rued the game's best chance falling to Nemanja Matic. Having been offered the freedom of Stretford by some awful United defending, the Serb had far too long to think about a shot that he managed to hit both high and wide of the goal.\n\nJohn Brewin is a staff writer for ESPN FC. Follow him on Twitter @JohnBrewinESPN.", "Is the Tour de France impossible to secure completely?": "Editor's note: This originally appeared at VeloNews.com\n\nSix months after the terrorist attack on the Paris offices of the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, a small black Renault sped into barriers set up at the Place de la Concorde, a few hundred meters from the finish line of the Tour de France.\n\nPolice, out in numbers never before seen at the Tour, fired into the vehicle; the driver escaped and was chased through Paris for an hour. He turned out to be a drunk just trying to avoid a police checkpoint. But as the peloton made its slow, celebratory way from S\u00e8vres to Paris, news of the incident spread, and the alert level rose.\n\nHours later, a man draped in white sheets made his way onto the Tour course and stood like a mid-river stone as the peloton streamed around him on its eighth circuit of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Policemen rushed in from the race's edge, waited for the riders to pass and the cars to stop, and submerged him in a pile of blue and gray.\n\nEveryone who saw the man in white expected the worst. In the end, nothing bad happened; the protest was peaceful, if inherently dangerous. But the fact that an un-credentialed bystander had been able to place himself in the middle of the peloton -- on that day, with that level of security -- was lost on no one. Among sporting events, bike races are uniquely vulnerable.\n\n\"Actually, the whole day I was worried something was going to happen,\" said Andr\u00e9 Greipel, who ended up winning the final-stage sprint on the Champs. \"We all were.\"\n\nTerrorists have never successfully targeted pro cycling. And security analysts say they know of no credible threats against major cycling events. But in a post-Paris, post-San Bernardino, post-London, post-Mumbai, post-Boston world, and in a sport so popular and exposed, the issue is inescapable.\n\nCountless lives were saved in Paris in November when security workers at an entrance to the 80,000-seat Stade de France, where the French national soccer team was playing Germany, detected a suicide bomber's explosive vest during a routine frisk. The Tour de France involves 15 million people lining open roadsides for three weeks and a worldwide live television audience, and no stadium walls or gated entrances exist to help control things.\n\n\"I don't mean to be too alarmist, but the Tour de France is almost impossible to secure,\" says David Murakami Wood, a surveillance researcher and event-security expert at Queens University in Ontario, who is also an avid cyclist. \"You've got a rolling event that moves around the country, through public roads, into some areas that are varyingly remote. There's no way you can create the kind of island security effect used elsewhere. You just cannot protect it in the same way.\"\n\n\"Island security\" refers to the creation of enclosed spaces with recognizable borders that can be defended. Metal detectors, fences, and armed guards work at a stadium, but not across an entire country.\n\nWith the exception of the Tour's start and finish zones -- which feature fenced-off areas for riders, media, and VIPs, with entrances manned by unarmed staffers from organizer ASO -- the entire 2,000-mile route of the Tour de France is relatively exposed, protected only by police presence and the intelligence services that work with them.\n\nTour security is a government operation, not one dictated by the race's organizer, ASO.\n\n\"We are going to improve [security] in some aspects, but we are not the ones who write the laws,\" says ASO director Christian Prudhomme. \"As race organizers, we clearly follow all of the recommendations from the government. The Gendarme and the police are our best allies. Of course, we cannot give away too many details about what we're going to do, for obvious reasons of confidentiality and for the protection of the country.\"\n\nThe Gendarmerie is a branch of France's armed services that exists under the Ministry of the Interior, alongside the French intelligence agencies. The rough equivalent in the U.S. would be a combination of the National Guard and local SWAT teams. The 91,000 Gendarmes are much more active and visible in France's daily life, though, in both intelligence gathering and execution of policing duties.\n\nFrench gendarmes are the Tour's main security force, working with a variety of agencies to protect riders, fans and VIPs alike. Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe presence of both Gendarme and local police at the Tour has been increasing. As Chris Froome jumped onto the podium in Paris this year, hundreds of heavily-armed security personnel stood in a long line, one every 15 paces, along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, facing out at crowds as riders and media wandered the closed road behind them. It was a security measure that hadn't existed a year prior, and it is backed by the same massive intelligence apparatus now monitoring global chatter for both general and specific threats.\n\nThe problem, Murakami Wood says, is the weight of unpredictability.\n\n\"As we know from the Paris attacks, most of the threat is likely to come from people inside France, who have no specific connection but are inspired by ISIS,\" he says. \"It's almost impossible to predict where those people might come from and what they might do. This is one of the biggest problems for intelligence more generally. There's no pattern at the moment.\"\n\nDiscussion of terrorism pivots so quickly into the realm of the hypothetical. It's a dangerous place, the imagination. This is terrorism's goal: using the fear of death to take the joy out of life. Which, of course, means the Tour must go on.\n\n\"Abandoning the Tour would be a strong symbol that terrorism won,\" Murakami Wood says.\n\nIf a real threat were detected, race organizers would face a difficult choice: cancel or continue on, confident in the Gendarmes, local police, and intelligence services. Neither is an attractive option. But the French have proven in their return to cafes and rock concerts -- just as Boston proved in its return to its marathon after the 2013 bombings, and London proved in its return to the Underground after attacks there in 2005 -- that resilience trumps fear, and normalcy quashes panic.\n\n\"The most important thing is that we continue to live as we always have,\" Prudhomme says. \"That's the best answer we can have.\"", "Looking back at the dramatic moments that defined 2015": "The 2015 golf season might very well be remembered as the year of the official changing of the guard, when Jordan Spieth made a valiant run at the Grand Slam, Jason Day claimed his first major championship and Rickie Fowler notched that breakthrough win in dramatic fashion via a playoff at the Players Championship.\n\nAnd don't forget about Rory McIlroy, who, although he was sidelined for some of the summer, still managed to get four worldwide victories during the year.\n\nSo as the year winds down, we revisit those historic victories through the stories told when they happened.\n\nThe PGA Championship, Aug. 13-16\n\nMike Ehrmann/PGA of America/Getty Images\n\nWinner:\n\nJason Day\n\nCourse:\n\nWhistling Straits in Haven, Wisconsin\n\nWatch:\n\nSunday Conversation\n\nPhoto gallery:\n\nThe PGA Championship in pictures\n\nHow he did it:\n\nThe emotional Day kept Spieth at bay, finishing the year's final major at a whopping 20 under par.

But, 79 years later, Murray would not have been bothered that this arena and its surrounds are so unsightly that at least one visiting broadcaster had been filming its opening sequences in the centre of Ghent.\n\nFor all Murray cared, they could have played this in the car park and, from the very point, it never looked as though he was going to be spooked by Perry's ghost, Goffin's game or thousands of lively Belgians. The DJ's techno-beats were no competition for the rhythm of Murray's groundstrokes, and he beat Goffin in straight sets.\n\nMurray completed his 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 victory with the best shot of the weekend, looping a backhand lob over Goffin's head and under the low-hanging girders, before he then collapsed on to the clay. It was a bench-clearing moment, with Murray's teammates and all the British coaches and support staff rushing on to join him. \"I can't believe it,\" Murray said. \"I always play my best tennis when I play for my country.\"\n\nAnd so Murray -- who had also contributed his team's other two points with his wins in Friday's singles and Saturday's doubles alongside his brother Jamie -- completed a victory that could bring the British public almost as much pleasure as when he won the Wimbledon title to become the first British male champion since Perry in 1936. And perhaps even more pleasure than his US Open title, given that it was in the middle of the night in Britain when he became the first British man to win a Grand Slam singles title since Perry, also in 1936.\n\nWhether in New York, London, or at the edge of Belgium's third-largest city, Murray is doing what he can to delete that phrase, \"not since Perry in 1936\" from the lexicon of British tennis.\n\nAndy Murray contributed 11 of 12 points won by Great Britain to lift the Davis Cup, under the stewardship of captain Leon Smith. Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images for LTA\n\nFor so long, Britain has been one of the great underachievers of this competition. Just five years ago, the British Davis Cup team's results were hardly becoming of a nation that had founded this tournament, and which receives millions of pounds every year from Wimbledon. A defeat to a team of Lithuanian teenagers left Britain with a relegation playoff against Turkey in Eastbourne in July 2010, when they faced dropping down to the lowest level of the competition, the Euro-African Zone Group Three. There they would have played the likes of Andorra, San Marino and Iceland.\n\nBut they won that tie, which was Leon Smith's first weekend as captain, and since then have had the fastest rise of any nation in the history of this competition. In reaching the final, Britain had beaten the other three Grand Slam-hosting nations this year, with victories over United States, France and Australia.\n\nWhile others might come to this part of Ghent on a Sunday afternoon to pick up some flat-pack bedside tables, Murray and his gang acquired something more substantial, and already assembled: the 105-kilogram Davis Cup.\n\nAll weekend, Murray had been \"pumped,\" and it was no different in the first of Sunday's reverse singles matches as he sought to give Britain an unassailable 3-1 lead. Once again, as they had done on the first two days of the tie, the Royal Belgian Tennis Federation had hung giant white curtains on all four sides of the court, and then dropped them down before play began for a 'big reveal' with the teams already on the clay. While all the other players stood still in position, Murray's feet were already moving, and that wasn't because of the music. He was keen to get going.\n\nOn the three other occasions that Murray had won the sport's biggest prizes his opponent had been one of the all-time greats of the game, with his victory in the 2012 Olympic final coming against Roger Federer, while he beat Novak Djokovic to win his US Open and Wimbledon titles. But this time, the tramline of history had brought Murray to a match against Goffin, the world No.16, and an opponent he had beaten for the loss of just one game when they had played in a best-of-three-sets match on a hard court at the Paris Masters this month.\n\nIt was almost as if the Belgian crowd sensed that the only way that their player was to beat Murray was to rile him, and so in the opening minutes they hissed, they booed, they jeered, and they used their air horns as he prepared to serve, or even at the top of his ball-toss. But Murray wasn't about to be pulled off his orbit. Murray, who has also played Goffin in the first round of the 2014 Wimbledon fortnight, had never previously lost a set against the Belgian, and that run continued here.\n\nBefore this weekend, you had to spool all the way back to 1995 -- when Pete Sampras' United States beat Russia -- for the last time that one player had won three live rubbers at a Davis Cup final. Those weren't the only numbers popping off Murray's strings as he became only the third man (after John McEnroe in 1982 and Mats Wilander the following year) to win eight singles rubbers in a year, as well as the fourth player to win 11 or more rubbers in a season, after McEnroe in 1982, Michael Stich in 1993 and Ivan Ljubicic in 2005.\n\nAlong with noise, color and emotion, history was not in short supply in this warehouse.", "Bobby Portis' development, Derrick Rose's rhythm key to Bulls' chances": "CHICAGO -- Last week, there were vague, undefined rumors that the Bulls were taking trade calls on Taj Gibson and Joakim Noah. It was typical NBA fare. When a team is sinking, sources come out with sandbags.\n\nIf that were true, Chicago's brain trust of John Paxson and Gar Forman might as well see what it can get for Benny the Bull, equipment manager John Ligmanowski and the Jordan statue. Because if you were to dump Gibson and Noah now, you\u2019d basically be ripping apart the team\u2019s identity.\n\nIt's not like anyone expects those moves to happen. This team only makes trades for luxury-tax or salary-dump reasons. Forman is so conservative, I think he gets paid in savings bonds.\n\nBut anyone who spends five minutes around the Bulls knows how valuable Noah and Gibson are, and it goes beyond the games.\n\nA longtime sub turned starter, the rugged Gibson had 11 rebounds in 38 minutes in Monday\u2019s 104-97 win over the Toronto Raptors, and Noah contributed by cheering from the bench as he recovers from a \u201csmall tear\u201d in his shoulder.\n\nBobby Portis, a rookie out of Arkansas, has thrived in limited minutes thus far this season. Jeff Haynes/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nTony Snell and Pau Gasol led the Bulls in scoring with 22 apiece, and Derrick Rose scored 20 in aggressive fashion.\n\nBut the two veteran bigs contributed in a major way, because even as they become more expendable thanks to Bobby Portis' growth, they\u2019re teaching the rookie how to play in the NBA. And the results are starting to show on the big stage.\n\nTheir training starts in practice, and with Noah out, Portis is getting a chance to prove what he can do in games. On Monday, Gibson told Portis to attack a mismatch with Raptors forward Patrick Patterson, and we saw the results. The Bulls were a plus-16 with Portis on the floor.\n\n\u201cOne thing about Bobby, he listens to his veterans,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cI told him right away to be very aggressive. And he came in and did the job. He brought energy. That\u2019s what we need. We need energy. It\u2019s good to have some fresh air from some young guys.\u201d\n\nThe Bulls trailed 52-49 at the half. Gasol and Rose did most of the scoring in the pivotal third quarter, and the reserves took over in the fourth.\n\nPortis had 12 points (on 6-for-10 shooting) and nine rebounds Monday night as part of the three-man bench crew with Aaron Brooks and Tony Snell. If this were the Blackhawks, we\u2019d be calling that trio the PBS Telethon Line. They each played around 27 minutes and combined for 51 points, 19 rebounds and 8 assists.\n\n\u201cThey played great,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThey looked more organized. They knew who was getting the ball, who was shooting the ball. Everybody wasn\u2019t stagnant when one guy was shooting the ball.\u201d\n\nWith Doug McDermott a late scratch (knee soreness), Snell, whose playing time has been cut due to ineffectiveness, was active and accurate, scoring 16 in the fourth quarter. He hit four of five 3-pointers and added seven rebounds.\n\nBulls coach Fred Hoiberg left in those two and kept in Brooks (17 points, five assists) to run the offense in the fourth quarter, not inserting Rose until there was a minute left.\n\nWe know Brooks can spark a second unit. Snell, now in his third season, might not score 22 in his next five games combined.\n\nBut the Bulls have to find 15 to 20 minutes for Portis when Noah comes back, likely at the expense of Nikola Mirotic and Gasol (who had 22 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists and 3 blocks). Portis can be an X factor.\n\nWe talk a lot about legacies and power dynamics between Jimmy Butler and Rose because it\u2019s good fodder for conversation. The Bulls can\u2019t go anywhere in the postseason without their backcourt shining on a near-nightly basis, but the glue of the team is in the frontcourt. Noah and Gibson are building Portis in their own image.\n\n\u201cHe goes against Joakim for fun, he goes against me in practice on a daily basis, he goes against Pau in pregame,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting molded in the right way. Like I tell guys on the team, rookies work their way in and earn their minutes. Bobby is earning his minutes, and he\u2019s doing it the right way.\u201d\n\nThe future of the Bulls isn\u2019t just in Hoiberg\u2019s offense or Butler\u2019s ascension, it\u2019s also in the way guys like Noah and Gibson carry themselves. For all the caterwauling about what the Bulls haven\u2019t done, give the players credit for building some continuity that goes beyond what former coach Tom Thibodeau did in his early days here.\n\nUnlike, say, a young Snell, Portis isn\u2019t shy. He doesn\u2019t pass up too many shots, and he can hit those Gasol-esque 18-foot jumpers to stretch the court. He also likes to mix it up.\n\n\u201cBobby\u2019s one of those guys, he\u2019s so eager, he challenges you every day in practice,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m going against one of those old-time Boston Celtics players. There\u2019s so much aggression, a lot of trash talking.\u201d\n\nNot quite lost in the bench mobbing was Rose\u2019s second consecutive game scoring 20-plus points. If he scored one more in that Christmas win over the Thunder, it would be three in a row. It was his first such back-to-back this season, which says a lot about Rose\u2019s slow start and some, but not quite enough, about how he\u2019s going to play in 2016.\n\n\"He's getting molded in the right way. Like I tell guys on the team, rookies work their way in and earn their minutes. Bobby is earning his minutes, and he's doing it the right way.\" Taj Gibson on Bulls rookie Bobby Portis\n\nWhile Rose has struggled by any metric or eye test, he was never as bad as the advanced stats showed. While he recovered from a broken orbital bone, he could still get the offense started, he just couldn\u2019t finish.\n\nWhat he was giving still wasn\u2019t enough for the expectations that come with being a max-level player, even with the eye injury. He played through blurred vision and a cumbersome face mask. He was clearly afraid of re-injuring his face, pulling up short on drives to the basket, bricking many of his jumpers.\n\nBut the mask is gone, and we\u2019re seeing more cohesion and confidence to his game. It\u2019s almost to the point where no one is too worried about him anymore. He\u2019s shooting 41 percent in December, which is Steph Curry-like compared to his first two months. But Rose probably needs to string together 10 of these games, maybe 20, for anyone to buy in.\n\n\u201cDerrick\u2019s been playing great the last couple games,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about his body. It\u2019s all about guys getting the right rotation, the right fit in the games.\u201d\n\nTwo minutes into the game Monday night, you could feel a little nostalgia and hope for the future when he blocked Raptors guard Kyle Lowry at one end and raced to the other for a contorting layup. Rose hit his first three shots, adding a 3 and a deftly-angled bank shot.\n\nHe went cold after that, missing seven of his next eight shots, but then got his game going with eight points in the last 5 minutes, 44 seconds of the third quarter. Rose had 10 points in the first half and 10 in the third. He's likely not going to be the NBA MVP again, but as long as he's in the running for the Bulls' MVP, that's enough.\n\nA popular supposition in the postgame locker room was if the Bulls have turned a corner in the week since Butler implored Hoiberg to coach this team harder. Hoiberg will learn as he goes in his rookie year, but it really comes down to the veteran core of the team leading by example and the younger players following.\n\nNo one is saying this team is a title contender -- for that to happen, Rose has to be consistently scoring 20-plus in the next few months. But the Bulls have the pieces to compete in the Eastern Conference, as long as they figure out how to play together on a nightly basis. It's not calculus, just some simple physical education.\n\n\u201cEnergy and effort,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIf we bring [those] two things, then who knows, man?\u201d", "St. Nick Spotted Around Sports": "You better watch out...

The top 10 in the Official World Golf Ranking features five players in their 20s, compared to only two when Woods made his professional debut in 1996.\n\nWoods\u2019 dominance simultaneously put Jack Nicklaus\u2019 major record within reach and made it more difficult to achieve by inspiring a younger generation of players, who are now winning majors. The average major winner last season was 27 years old, the youngest in a single season since 1997, when Woods won his first professional major start at the Masters.\n\nWhen Woods turned professional in 1996, the No. 1 player in the world was 41-year-old Greg Norman, and seven of the top 10 players in the world were over 35. Today, just three of the top 10 are over 35, and the top three are all under 30.\n\nGreat golf doesn\u2019t end at 40\n\nInjuries aside, turning 40 doesn\u2019t have to be the end of a player\u2019s productive career on the golf course.\n\nThe modern record for major victories in a player\u2019s 40s is three, held by both Nicklaus and Ben Hogan. Hogan had his best year at age 40, winning all three of his major championship starts in 1953, but was denied a chance to go for the Grand Slam because of a scheduling conflict between The Open Championship and PGA Championship.\n\nAs for PGA Tour wins, Vijay Singh\u2019s 22 are the standard for a player in his 40s. In fact, after turning 40 in February 2003, Singh went on to win 12 times in 52 starts through the end of 2004, including a nine-win season in 2004 in which he won the PGA Championship and set the single-season earnings record.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t have to stop in the 40s: Davis Love III claimed victory at this year\u2019s Wyndham Championship at the age of 51, the third-oldest winner in PGA TOUR history. It was Love\u2019s first win on the PGA TOUR since 2008.\n\nWoods won 14 of his first 46 professional major championship starts, missing the cut just once and posting 22 top-three finishes in that span. But Woods\u2019 last major championship victory came at the 2008 U.S. Open, and he has missed the cut in six of his 24 major appearances since then.\n\nWoods currently stands second in professional major championship victories (14) and PGA Tour wins (79). His last appearance on the PGA Tour came at the Wyndham Championship (Aug. 23), where he finished tied for 10th. Woods played in 11 official events on the PGA Tour in 2015, missing the cut four times, three of which came in majors.\n\nWoods vs. Nicklaus\n\nWhy was there such confidence that Woods could top Nicklaus\u2019 major championship victory record? On his 32nd birthday, Nicklaus had won nine majors, half of his eventual total. On Woods\u2019 32nd birthday, Woods had won 13 majors, including five of his past 12 starts.\n\nBut beginning at age 32, Nicklaus won nine majors. Woods has won only one.\n\nThe difference between the two is consistency and durability. Woods is turning 40; Nicklaus played every major he was eligible to play for 42 straight years. Nicklaus played 35 majors in his 50s; Woods played 34 majors in his 30s. Woods has played 70 majors as a professional; Nicklaus played 146 straight as a professional.\n\nIf Woods had equaled Nicklaus\u2019 major performance in his 30s, he would already have reached 18 wins.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nIt\u2019s been about a year and a half since the last time Woods was No. 1 in the Official World Golf Ranking, but injuries and poor performances have driven him down to 416th in the final ranking of 2015. Before this year, the last time Woods was ranked outside the top 400 in the world was the week that he turned pro in 1996.\n\nTiger Woods As a Pro in Majors 1st 46 Majors Last 24 Majors Wins 14 0 Win pct 30% 0% Top-3s 22 2 Missed cuts 1 6* To par -126 +34 Rds 75 or worse 14 13 * Missed cut in last 3 majors (1st time in career)\n\nWoods remains three wins shy of matching Sam Snead\u2019s PGA Tour-record 82 wins, but he\u2019s still well ahead of Snead\u2019s pace. Snead didn\u2019t win his 80th event until the age of 47.\n\nWoods has been a nonfactor in the majors for more than two years (the last time he entered the final round fewer than 10 shots off the lead was the 2013 Open Championship at Muirfield, where he shot a final-round 74 to finish tied for sixth.\n\nNo player in the modern era (since the Masters began in 1934) has won four majors after turning 40, which is what Woods would need to do to match Nicklaus.\n\nBut this is a different time than the one in which Nicklaus and Hogan each won three majors in their 40s. In the 1950s, when Hogan won three majors as a 40-year-old, the average major winner was 34 years old. Nicklaus turned 40 in 1980, and the average age of a major winner in that decade was 32.4.\n\nIn the past two years (eight major winners), the average winner has been 28 years old. In the 1950s and 1980s combined, there were five major winners 25 years old or younger. With four years still remaining in this decade, we have already had eight winners that young, including four in the past six majors.", "NHL -- Philadelphia Flyers' Andrew MacDonald broken by big contract": "On a Friday night in Allentown, Pennsylvania, the Hershey Bears visiting the Lehigh Valley Phantoms is a premiere rivalry matchup in the American Hockey League.\n\nThe PPL Center, the sparkling, 8,400-seat home of the Philadelphia Flyers' top minor-league affiliate, is jammed to capacity and there's a definite buzz in the building. The energy reaches a crescendo as the final horn sounds, with the hometown Phantoms ousting the Washington Capitals' affiliate in a hotly contested game featuring 10 goals and all sorts of rule-bending rough play that's hardly seen in the NHL anymore, yet remains the lifeblood of minor-league hockey.\n\nAlthough just 80 miles up the road from Philadelphia, this is a long way from the NHL. Except for what happened midway through the second period.\n\nWith bruising Bears center Liam O'Brien serving a five-minute match penalty for a vicious shot to the head of an unsuspecting Phantom, Lehigh Valley's star defenseman steps on the ice. And he doesn't leave.\n\nFor five straight minutes, the Phantoms' top blueliner patrols the ice, dipping and darting around penalty killers, making crisp passes and controlling the play. This \"prospect\" is a conductor setting an NHL-level tempo that his AHL competition struggles to keep up with.\n\nLehigh Valley scores a power-play goal shortly thereafter to break a 3-3 tie en route to a 6-4 win. The Phantoms' top defenseman finishes with three assists, running his totals up to 18 points in 27 games.\n\nThis sort of performance normally leads to a player being called up to the NHL.\n\nBut this defenseman's name is Andrew MacDonald, and he's not going anywhere.\n\nMacDonald said the pressure of a big contract hurt his play on the ice. Andre Ringuette/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nAfter signing a six-year, $30 million contract extension with the Flyers before last season, this 29-year-old struggled so badly in Philadelphia that general manager Ron Hextall had little choice but to send MacDonald to the AHL in October.\n\nBesides opening the door for Shayne Gostisbehere to take the NHL by storm, this move to shuttle an underachieving, big-ticket free agent to the minor leagues enabled the salary-cap-strapped Flyers to save $950,000.\n\nMacDonald still receives his full paycheck of $5 million for the season, but only $4.05 million counts against the Flyers' salary cap; it is two-and-a-half times more than his 19 teammates will make this season ... combined.\n\nWhile his contract remains big-league, his uniform is now minor-league.\n\n\"There's a bit of shock initially,\" MacDonald said. \"I wasn't really expecting it. But the team is dealing with cap issues. I get it.\"\n\nAfter receiving his first life-changing contract, MacDonald endured a downward spiral, transforming from a useful, high-minute defenseman with the New York Islanders to a public whipping boy in Philadelphia.\n\nEven he admitted his pay raise -- he went from making $575,000 to $5 million before the 2014-15 season -- had an impact on his fall from grace.\n\n\"I think I put a little too much pressure on myself,\" MacDonald said. \"I tried to live up to expectations and got away from what made me successful before. You get worried about making mistakes and things snowballed throughout the year. I think last year it got to a point where I was trying to do too much and got scared to do anything.\"\n\nIn his first season with the Flyers, everything that could go wrong for MacDonald did. His point total was cut in half, his shot blocking became less frequent, his possession numbers dipped and his ice time slipped away.\n\nMacDonald's Decline Andrew MacDonald saw a big drop in his production after signing a big contract extension before the 2014-15 season.\n\n* - Played for both NYI and PHI in 2013-14 2013-14* 2014-15 Games 82 58 Goals 4 2 Assists 20 10 Points 24 12 Ice Time 22.32 20:01\n\nAlthough the hire of Dave Hakstol to replace Craig Berube behind the Flyers' bench initially seemed like a chance for MacDonald to have a fresh start this fall, the writing was on the wall. With Hextall insisting on a system of accountability that values playing the best players regardless of their salary, MacDonald was already behind the 8-ball heading into training camp. And with Evgeny Medvedev's emergence, Radko Gudas' return to health and Michael Del Zotto's chance to revive his career, MacDonald was deemed expendable.\n\nOut of the NHL for the first time in six years, MacDonald is at a completely different place in his life than when he last played in the AHL for the Islanders' affiliate in 2009-10.\n\nAt that time, he was a plucky long-shot to make the NHL who was only drafted because of the eccentricities of Islanders owner Charles Wang. At the 2006 draft, Wang stormed his team's draft table and demanded that newly hired head coach Ted Nolan make the team's sixth-round pick, much to the dismay of Islanders scouts.\n\nNolan didn't have a scouting background but chose MacDonald, his stud defenseman when he coached Quebec Major Junior Hockey League's Moncton Wildcats to a berth in the Memorial Cup the previous season.\n\nHaving been passed over in the draft during his first two years of eligibility, MacDonald seized his fortuitous opportunity. A model AHL defenseman with the Bridgeport Sound Tigers, he cracked the Islanders' lineup for good in 2009-10 and became one of the team's top defensemen under coach Scott Gordon, who replaced Nolan in 2008.\n\nCoincidentally, Gordon is now MacDonald's AHL coach with the Phantoms.\n\n\"When Andrew first got here, I think he was trying to make a perfect play every single time,\" Gordon said. \"After the first five games or so, there was a dramatic change in his skating with the puck and making easier plays.\n\n\"He's come here with the right attitude and his confidence is high right now. For me, he's worked himself back to where he was.\"\n\nUnfortunately for MacDonald, today's NHL is a little more complicated than better players staying in the NHL and worse players remaining in the AHL. In the salary-cap world, numbers matter, whether it's the number of defensemen on the roster or the money owed to them.\n\nAnd these days the Flyers don't have room for MacDonald, even if he has seemed to fix the problems that led to him being sent to the AHL.\n\nWhen the Flyers had injuries earlier in December, they were able to contort themselves within the salary cap just enough to fit MacDonald in for one game. When the team was healthy again, despite a worthy performance in 19:29 of ice time -- he blocked three shots, saw power-play and penalty-killing time, and was on for two goals for and two goals against while playing his former team, the Islanders, on Dec. 8 -- he was back in the AHL, where it appears he'll stay barring future injuries.\n\n\"Mac's a good player,\" Hextall told media earlier this season. \"We can't forget that. I'm convinced he's going to be back in the NHL and be a productive player at some point.\n\n\"He's an NHL player, but we're in a jam here.\"\n\nA jam with only one way out for MacDonald, according to NBC analyst and Flyers color commentator Keith Jones.\n\n\"It's going to be a big challenge. All Andrew can do is worry about the things that he can control,\" Jones said. \"He can go down and play with the right attitude, wait for his opportunity, and in this game, with the number of injuries that we have, you never know when that opportunity is going to come.\n\n\"But right now, Andrew's in no-man's land.\"\n\nAnd no-man's land is not the NHL.", "Ahead of his Boston finale, Kobe Bryant says green his favorite color": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- As Kobe Bryant makes the rounds on his farewell tour, bidding adieu to road arenas one by one before heading off into retirement this summer, some stops mean far more than others for the Los Angeles Lakers icon.\n\nAnd perhaps no stop means as much -- or carries as much personal history for Bryant and for his team -- as Wednesday's: He will play his final game in Boston against the archrival Celtics, a team Bryant faced twice in the NBA Finals -- losing in 2008, then winning in 2010.\n\nIn terms of what to expect from the crowd, the 37-year-old Bryant said he wasn't entirely sure.\n\n\"Love-hate fest sort of thing,\" Bryant said Monday after his team's 108-98 loss to the Charlotte Hornets at Time Warner Cable Arena. \"I'm bringing my family down, because my kids have never even been to Boston. They've never even been to Boston. I'm looking forward to them getting a chance to see the city a little bit. And then just experience the green.\n\n\"It's just a different green. I want them to be able to see that.\"\n\nSpeaking of the color green, Bryant added, \"It's actually my favorite color. I don't have green clothes. It's tough to pull that off. [Former Lakers guard] Jerry [West] won't even wear green drawers. He and I have talked about this before. He's just allergic to green. It's been my favorite color forever. I'm fine with green.\"\n\nA Laker who has often said he bleeds purple and gold loves the color of that team's bitter foe? It might seem hard to believe, but Bryant swears it's true.\n\n\"I've always loved it,\" Bryant said. \"It's a little weird, isn't it?\"\n\nBryant also reflected on what he has often called the most satisfying of his five championships: the 2010 Finals win over the Celtics.\n\nThat series lasted seven games and helped Bryant and the Lakers avenge the 2008 Finals loss, when the Celtics beat the Lakers by 39 points in closeout Game 6 at TD Garden.\n\nHowever, the Lakers didn't win Game 7 easily in 2010. They trailed by 13 points in the third quarter, and Bryant struggled all night, finishing with 23 points on 6-of-24 shooting. He did add 15 rebounds and hit 11 of 15 from the free throw line.\n\n\"I don't know how we won it,\" Bryant said of Game 7 in the 2010 Finals. \"We had a feeling in the huddle that we were going to win it. We just had no idea how. We just kept chipping away and chipping away and chipping away, and all of the sudden, we found ourselves in the game with a chance to kind of steal it.\"\n\nSpeaking of himself in that game, Bryant credited the Celtics' defense.\n\n\"They caused a lot of problems for me,\" he said. \"I had to figure out how to beat them another way. That's the responsibility you have to have. You've got to figure out some kind of way to have an imprint on the game, and then if the game is close and you have a chance to make a big shot, then it's your responsibility to make one.\n\n\"Fortunately, I was able to make a nice pull-up jumper and give us a little cushion. But it was a tough game.\"\n\nBryant has been receiving cheers at virtually every road arena he has played in so far this season, though it's not clear if that will continue in Boston. Bryant did say he misses playing the villain role, which meant being booed at road arenas.\n\n\"Yeah, it was just so natural to me for so many years,\" he said. \"It became something that just felt comfortable. It felt a little awkward at first, to be honest with you, to get this praise, but I'm glad they didn't do this many, many years ago, because it's like Kryptonite. It would've taken away all my energy and all my strength, because I relied a lot on being the villain. Sometimes, the best way to beat the villain is to give them a hug.\"\n\nSo would he like more boos, especially considering the Celtics are up next?\n\n\"Nah, if [the 5-27 Lakers were] a championship-caliber team, honestly, I would probably come out and say something extremely controversial just to piss everybody off so everybody hates me for one more year,\" Bryant said with a laugh. \"But I don't need to do that.\"", "Tiger Woods turning 40 -- less of a benchmark age than you might think, golf greats say": "Jack Nicklaus doesn't think turning 40 makes much of a difference for a pro golfer. In fact, the 18-time major winner told ESPN.com's Michael Collins that he got better after his 40th birthday, winning two majors in 1980. (0:58)\n\nTiger Woods is turning 40, just the latest in a lengthy string of events reminding us that he's well into the back-nine of his career. Or as Woods himself often says, \"Father Time is undefeated.\"\n\nWhile the world debates Woods' age in \"golf years\" and just how much gas he has left in the tank, at least one subsection of observers is scoffing at the notion that he's too old. In fact, ask some of the game's senior statesmen about turning 40, and they're likely to break into what sounds like a Henny Youngman routine.\n\n\"After you get to be 40 years old,\" 51-year-old Lee Janzen said, \"the definition of an all-nighter isn't being out all night. It's sleeping through the night without having to go to the bathroom.\" \"My kids will say, 'That old guy we saw yesterday ...'\"\n\nTom Lehman, 56, said. \"And I'm like, 'Wait a second -- that old guy was younger than me.'\" \"Forty? That's too long ago,\" Hale Irwin, 70, said. \"Ask me something like what I did yesterday -- and I'll tell you I can't remember that, either.\"\n\nAt age 40, Jack Nicklaus won his fourth U.S. Open as well as the PGA Championship later in the year. That doesn't mean Tiger Woods will pull off the same feat in 2016, but it does show age can just be a number, especially for a golfer. AP Photo/Paul Vathis\n\nLaughs aside, most players with 40 in their rearview mirrors considered it more speed bump than roadblock. That includes the only man with more major championship victories than Woods -- and the one with whom he is so frequently compared.\n\n\"I remember that I had a bad year at 39 and a good year at 40,\" 75-year-old Jack Nicklaus recalled.\n\nHe's right. In 1979, at the age of 39, Nicklaus decided to tinker with his swing. He played just 12 events, claimed only three top-10 finishes and didn't win a PGA Tour event for the first time since turning professional nearly two decades earlier. One year later, Nicklaus bounced back, winning the 16th and 17th major titles of his career at the ripe age of 40.\n\n\"Forty was just a number for me,\" he explained. \"It really didn't make any difference. The hardest birthday I had was 65, because I knew 65 was the year I wasn't going to play anymore.\"\n\nIf you're looking for a group of golfers to take pity on Woods for hitting the Big Four-Oh, don't look to those who have already passed that benchmark, because most will simply echo Nicklaus' sentiments about the occasion.\n\n\"Whether you're 39 or 42 or whatever it may be, it really doesn't make a difference,\" Bernhard Langer, 58 said. \"It's all in your head. Some 40-year-olds feel like 20, and others feel like 60.\"\n\n\"So many good things have happened to guys in their careers after the age of 40,\" Lehman pointed out. \"If you can keep yourself healthy and keep yourself motivated, your forties can be very fruitful.\"\n\nOf course, therein lies the rub of the green for Woods. He has been playing competitive golf since before kindergarten. He has spent countless hours beating balls at the range, searching for secrets in the dirt. He has endured multiple surgeries to his knee and -- more recently -- his back, with two microdiscectomies and a follow-up procedure in the past two years, if you're scoring at home.\n\nAnd so, most believe it's not Woods' age that will hinder a comeback as much as his health. After all, no professional golfer could continue playing competitively after three back operations, right?\n\nFuzzy Zoeller knows a thing -- or three -- about back surgeries. If Tiger Woods, who has undergone three procedures on his back, takes it easy, that might let his body heal enough to get back to golf. Chris Condon/PGA TOUR/Getty Images\n\nWrong -- and Fuzzy Zoeller is living proof. Zoeller, now 64, underwent his first back surgery right after the 1984 U.S. Open. He spent six weeks in a hospital and lost 30 pounds, then had to work his way back to just walking, let alone swinging a club again.\n\nThe next year, though, in just his third tournament back, he won the Bay Hill Classic. Within a few years, Zoeller would have another back surgery, then a third, but each time returned to a competitive role.\n\n\"The one thing you can't do after back surgery is go in and try to tear what the doctors have already repaired,\" Zoeller explained. \"I think that's where Tiger has probably made his big mistake. He's tried to get back and do the exercising and stuff he normally did. You've got to let Mother Nature take her course; you've got to let her heal.\"\n\nAs he turns 40 and, possibly, a bit wiser, it appears this will be the strategy Woods employs going forward. Rather than rushing back to competition as he has done in the past, it seems he has resigned to let the healing process take its time.\n\nWhen he is healthy enough to play golf for the first time in his fourth decade, the scenario for Woods might not be as bleak as many believe. At least, that's what those golfers who have lived through it contend. And hey, there's a bright side to getting older, too.\n\nAs Janzen explained, tongue firmly planted in cheek, \"It took until I was 50 until I started hitting it shorter. But one of the benefits is that you start losing your hearing, so things don't bother you, because you can't hear them. You think you're hitting it further, because you can't see where it lands.\"", "Stand and deliver: Who in MLB is under the most pressure in 2016?": "Insider\n\nFormer Yankees pitcher David Cone experienced some of the worst failures and greatest successes while playing for both New York teams, making him a vast resource of perspective. In the 1988 playoffs, he was author of a ghostwritten column that inspired a Dodgers comeback, and later, with the Mets, he was the central figure in a play that will be part of baseball\u2019s permanent blooper reel.\n\nHe also was a leader of arguably the greatest team of all time, the 1998 Yankees, and in 1999, Cone threw a perfect game. So when he spoke with young players, Cone had the best advice -- and hopefully, the MLB Players Association and some teams take advantage of that in their player-development programs. He would tell others this about pressure: It means that the fans care about you.\n\nThe booing? It\u2019s just them caring. They want you to win, he would explain, they are rooting for you to have success, and when you lose, this is their way of expressing how much they care.\n\nYou can decide for yourself whether this is true or whether this is a really useful Jedi mind trick necessary to compartmentalize negative response. In the meantime, we present our annual list of a dozen folks in baseball under the most pressure for the upcoming season.\n\n1. David Price, Boston Red Sox: The left-hander got the most money ever guaranteed to a pitcher in a contract in agreeing to his $217 million deal with the Red Sox. In return, he is being charged with the responsibility of leading a team that has finished last in back-to-back seasons to the front of the AL East. Price is coming off a season in which he had a career-low 2.45 ERA, with 225 strikeouts in 220 1/3 innings, but beyond the pitching part of this, he has never shirked the responsibility of being the ace -- and in Boston, in one of baseball\u2019s largest markets, the weight of that challenge is even greater.\n\n2. Andrew Friedman, Los Angeles Dodgers president: He is in his second full season of running the Dodgers\u2019 baseball operations, and already his work is under enormous scrutiny because of how the team bought for the highest price and operating with a record payroll has been outbid repeatedly in the past six months. The Rangers boxed out the Dodgers for Cole Hamels in July, and then the Diamondbacks jumped into the bidding late for Zack Greinke; reportedly, the Dodgers were also in on the conversations for Johnny Cueto and Mike Leake, and didn\u2019t land either.\n\nIn time, Friedman\u2019s decision to veer around the bloated contracts may well turn out to be justified. But in the interim, the Dodgers have to try to continue the business of trying to extend the record of success established under former GM Ned Colletti and manager Don Mattingly, who won the NL West repeatedly -- in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\n\nIt goes without saying that if the Dodgers continue their relatively sedate offseason, fans of the team will be closely monitoring events of 2016. But so will folks within the building, from Friedman\u2019s bosses to pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who will have the opportunity to opt out of his contract after the 2018 season.\n\n3. Mike Rizzo, Washington Nationals general manager: Beginning with the decision to fire Matt Williams, Rizzo\u2019s handpicked manager, rival executives have watched the moves of the Nationals this winter and looked for fingerprints of the team\u2019s ownership, following the team\u2019s greatly disappointing season of 2015. The pitching staff was never as dominant as the Nationals had hoped, and as the year progressed, injuries and performance issues greatly affected the lineup and the bullpen -- which led to the trade for Jonathan Papelbon and the demotion of Drew Storen. At season's end, the image of the Nationals that resonated most was that of Papelbon clutching Bryce Harper by the neck in a dugout brawl.", "Middleweights Anderson Silva, Michael Bisping to headline UFC event in London on Feb. 27": "Former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva will face Michael Bisping on Feb. 27 at O2 Arena in London, officials announced Thursday.\n\nWidely considered the greatest fighter of all time, Silva (33-6) hasn't fought since he defeated Nick Diaz via unanimous decision at UFC 183 on Jan. 31. After the fight, it was revealed that Silva had failed multiple drug tests (steroids) that had been administered by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. The NSAC banned Silva for one year and changed the result of his fight against Diaz to a no-contest.\n\nSilva, 40, has maintained his innocence in regards to the failed tests. During a disciplinary hearing in August, the Brazilian legend blamed the failed tests on a contaminated sexual-performance-enhancing drug he was on.\n\nAnderson Silva received a one-year suspension after testing positive for several steroids prior to his last fight -- against Nick Diaz -- on Jan. 31. Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nThe Jan. 31 bout was Silva's first since he suffered a broken leg during a UFC title fight against Chris Weidman in December 2013. Silva holds the UFC record for consecutive title defenses with 10. He won his first 16 bouts in the UFC before losing the title in a knockout loss to Weidman in July 2013.\n\nBisping (27-7) was originally scheduled to fight Gegard Mousasi on Feb. 27, but he now receives the matchup against Silva that he has long coveted. The British martial artist is tied for sixth all-time in UFC appearances with 24, but he has never fought for a UFC title.\n\nBoth Bisping and Silva signed with the UFC in 2006, but they have not crossed paths until now.\n\nNow training out of Southern California, the 36-year-old Bisping is on a two-fight win streak.

Start by learning about the smartest players on each of the four teams.\n\nThe names Ryan Kelly (Alabama), Ty Darlington (Oklahoma), Jack Allen (Michigan State) and Jay Guillermo (Clemson) might or might not ring a bell. Few fans, not counting ex-offensive linemen or O-line junkies, could identify all four. But those seeking SGITR (smartest guy/gal in the room) status at Thursday's playoff watch parties should know who they are.\n\nSo where does this cram session begin? The same place each play from scrimmage does: under center.\n\n\"What an odd way to start a play, putting a ball between your legs,\" Michigan State offensive line coach Mark Staten said. \"You've got to be precise with that and also be precise with the directions you've given everybody else as that play's about to happen. And a split second before that play happens, [the opponent has] shifted or moved, and you've got to trust your line mates to adjust accordingly.\n\nEditor's Picks Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic: No. 3 Michigan State vs. No. 2 Alabama Check out ESPN's coverage of the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic, which will be aired live on ESPN on Dec. 31.\n\nCapital One Orange Bowl: No. 4 Oklahoma vs. No. 1 Clemson Check out ESPN's coverage of the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Capital One Orange Bowl, which will be aired live on ESPN on Dec. 31.\n\n2015-16 College Football Playoff and bowl schedule Here's a look at the entire College Football Playoff and college football bowl lineup for 2015-16. 2 Related\n\n\"It's a strange position.\"\n\nIt's also a fascinating, multilayered position played by bright, charismatic, selfless individuals. Other than quarterback, center is considered the offense's most important component, what Kelly calls \"the governor of the offense,\" even though centers receive a fraction of the attention.\n\nThey're big men with little egos and broad shoulders, capable of carrying a heavy burden on every play and in every game.\n\nSaid Allen, a four-year starter, \"It's a lot more than just snapping the ball and running into another fat guy.\"\n\nLesson 1: Centers are really, really smart\n\nThe Campbell Trophy, formerly the Draddy Trophy, is best known by its nickname, the Academic Heisman. It's the most prestigious academic award in college football.\n\nWhen Darlington went to New York for the Campbell Trophy award ceremony earlier this month, he wasn't surprised that two of the other 12 finalists, Ohio State's Jacoby Boren and UCLA's Jake Brendel, also played center. No other position produced more than two finalists. Kelly and Allen, a four-time Academic All-Big Ten selection, both were semifinalists for this year's award.\n\n\"That's not a coincidence,\" said Darlington, who became the second center in the past four years to win the Campbell Trophy. \"The center has to be the brain. He has to be the smartest guy up front, if not the smartest guy on the field, to be able to adapt and make decisions under fire.\"\n\nA center's responsibility on a given play includes but is not limited to setting the protection and potentially sliding it in one direction, depending on the defensive look; identifying the \"point linebacker,\" who triggers assignments for other offensive linemen; surveying safety depth and how it relates to the type of front being shown (even, odd, bear, and so on); and knowing the quarterback's cadence and snap count. They also have to snap the ball seamlessly and, if the quarterback is in shotgun, accurately.\n\nCenters have to enjoy deconstructing the game, learning what everyone is doing and why plays succeed or fail. They have to watch film until their eyes gloss over but also make instant decisions in games when the defense provides new looks.\n\n\"I don't know if we're all Einsteins, but we accept the responsibility that comes with the territory,\" said Kelly, who won the Rimington Trophy as the nation's top center this season (Allen was a finalist). \"You have to be almost perfect all the time, but you're going to mess up more things that you get right at first.\n\n\"A lot of things that make centers successful are trial and error.\"\n\nSuccessful centers embrace the mental challenges. When Darlington first came to Oklahoma, he forecasted a post-football career in the medical field. His outlook changed when offensive line coach Bill Bedenbaugh arrived three years ago.\n\nBedenbaugh pushed the linemen to dissect opponents' tendencies: a pass rusher's favorite moves, the way safeties trigger blitzes with their coverage assignments. Football was complex, and Darlington fell in love with it. Coaching is now a possibility for him when he's through.\n\n\"I started thinking, 'Playing football at this level, especially those who are great at it, aren't inferior to anyone in intelligence,'\" said Darlington, who earned his bachelor's degree at Oklahoma in two and a half years while maintaining a 3.91 GPA and is now pursuing a master's. \"I can break it down, how it works, the system. If you tell me a formation, I could tell you the top two fronts Clemson is going to line up in.\"\n\nWhen Michigan State's offense ends a possession, Staten peppers Allen with questions and gets the answers he needs from him.\n\n\"What look did we get? Did they do something different? With the safeties in, did that change the protectional point?\" Staten said. \"His overall knowledge and genuine football IQ is terrific. It helps in everything we're doing.\"\n\nCenters have to be multitaskers, according to Dave Rimington, perhaps the greatest to play the position at the college level. Rimington, a two-time Outland Trophy winner at Nebraska and the only lineman to ever win Big Eight Offensive Player of the Year honors (1981), has seen smart linemen who froze up when put at center.\n\n\"You can't go up and down,\" Rimington said. \"You facilitate greatness. You have to facilitate everyone else who are the playmakers and you can't make the mistake.\n\n\"You know you've got an important job, but nobody else really does on the outside.\"\n\nOklahoma's Ty Darlington offers a pretty simple job description of centers: \"The center has to be the brain. He has to be the smartest guy up front, if not the smartest guy on the field, to be able to adapt and make decisions under fire.\" Icon Sportswire/AP Images\n\nLesson 2: Snapping isn't easy\n\nAbout all the outside sees of the center is the snap. The expectation is perfection. Any problems can be disastrous.\n\nJust ask Stanford, which had two fumbled snaps in a 38-36 loss to Oregon that essentially eliminated the Cardinal from playoff contention.\n\nAlabama coach Nick Saban said of centers: \"The guy's got to be physical, he's got to be quick, he's got to be able to handle nose guards, he's got to be athletic enough to block at the second level, and he's got to be able to handle the ball. That's what a lot of guys can't do, handle the ball.\"\n\nThe snap itself, like the center position, is a football oddity. While the other four linemen position themselves for power or agility or leverage, the center is, by rule, off balance.\n\nHe is not only closest to an opposing defensive lineman but, if the offense operates from under center, the most direct route to the quarterback. Snap-stepping, a skill confined to the center, is football's version of rub-your-stomach-pat-your-head. Your arm moves backward, but your feet move forward.\n\n\"The mechanics are different than any other position,\" Darlington said. \"It's the snap and being able to get that hand back up for blocking. You've got a 320-pound dude about eight inches from your face, and you can't grab him with your right hand until you snap the ball between your legs and get that hand back up.\"\n\nSnapping is not natural for many. In high school, Allen, a player \"who has to do things 1,000 times,\" used to practice snapping by setting up a small clothesbasket atop a garbage can in his driveway. He snapped until he consistently hit the basket without looking.\n\nA strong center-quarterback connection is vital to consistent snapping. When Guillermo took over the starting job from the injured Ryan Norton early this fall, he initially struggled to master Deshaun Watson's cadence. They worked to get it down.\n\n\"You have to be in sync,\" Guillermo said.\n\nThere's also the, uh, cozy nature of non-shotgun snaps. Centers and quarterback really have little choice but to get comfortable.\n\n\"I tell Deshaun just about every day that I love him,\" Guillermo said, laughing. \"I'm sure that doesn't make it any less awkward.\"\n\nLesson 3: Center isn't for everyone\n\nThere are longer and more athletic linemen who play tackle. There are more powerful linemen who play guard. Centers often lack a superlative trait. It's the sum of their skills that stands out.\n\n\"Not everybody can play center,\" Kelly said.\n\nAll four playoff centers played the position at a relatively young age, including Guillermo, who started in the second grade, but centers are usually transplants from other spots. Bedenbaugh has recruited \"very, very few\" high school centers. Most who eventually wind up there come in as offensive tackles, tight ends or defensive linemen.\n\nEven then, it's a gamble.\n\n\"Throughout my career, we've tried to make guys centers who would have been really darn good centers, but they couldn't put it all together,\" Bedenbaugh said.\n\nBeing vocal is non-negotiable. Centers have to be assertive and confident in their calls. Even if they make the wrong call, a play has a chance if the other linemen are aligned.\n\n\"You can't let other people second-guess what you're doing,\" Darlington said.\n\nCenters must thrive on pressure without seeking praise, but they're not robots. Many of the big men have bigger personalities, such as Guillermo, a locker-room jokester who spares no one, player or coach.\n\nImitations are his specialty.\n\n\"He's got Coach [Dabo] Swinney down,\" Clemson co-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott said. \"He'll listen all week long to the coaches, and then on Friday nights on the bus, on the way to the movie, that's usually when he'll get on the mic.\"\n\nAdded Guillermo: \"It's a tradition now. I've got guys laughing pretty hard every week.\"\n\nAllen puts on a different kind of show. He'll invite his line mates to his apartment, gather them around his bathtub and then feed mice to his pet python (Allen also co-owns a cat named Bubbles that his roommate, Spartans tight end Paul Lang, found on Craigslist this summer).\n\n\"They all watched it,\" Staten said. \"Then he'd bring in his iPhone like, 'Look, Coach.'\"\n\nOn senior day against Penn State, Allen became the rare center to be noticed outside of a botched snap or a penalty. With Michigan State up big in the fourth quarter, Allen lined up in the backfield and rumbled 9 yards for a touchdown, stiff-arming a Lions defender on the way.\n\nAs fat-guy touchdowns go, Allen, a former high school fullback, graded well.\n\n\"I liked it. It was good, but I'm not a big fan of all the attention,\" he said. \"People want to get on TV and get recognized, but I don't think many centers care about that.\"\n\nCenters prefer to be in the backdrop. But remember them.\n\nThe team that reaches the finish line Jan. 11 will owe a lot to the man where each play begins.\n\nESPN's Chris Low contributed to this story.", "Frida Hansdotter edges Wendy Holdener to win women's World Cup slalom": "LIENZ, Austria -- Frida Hansdotter held on to her first-run lead to win a women's World Cup slalom on Tuesday, making her the main candidate to take over the discipline title from the injured Mikaela Shiffrin.\n\nThe Swede's third career win helped extend her lead in the discipline standings to 100 points over Petra Vlhova of Slovakia. She is the only skier to reach the podium in all four slaloms this season.\n\nHansdotter finished in a combined time of 1 minute, 47.02 seconds on the Schlossberg course to edge Wendy Holdener of Switzerland by 0.07. Vlhova, who won the previous slalom in Are, Sweden, two weeks ago, posted the fastest second-run time and finished 0.43 behind in third.\n\nMichaela Kirchgasser of Austria, who was 0.39 back in third after the opening leg, failed to finish her final run.\n\n\"It was a really nice race today,\" Hansdotter said. \"I had a solid first run but I felt I had more to give.\"\n\nCarrying a slim 0.11-second lead into her second run, Hansdotter avoided mistakes and lost just four-hundredths of her advantage, denying Holdener a first World Cup slalom victory for a Swiss female skier in 13 years.\n\n\"It was amazing,\" said Hansdotter, who raised both arms in celebration after crossing the finish. \"I knew it was close.

He wrestles with Handy on the left block, pivots baseline, pivots again, then goes up and under.\n\nBy now he has worked up a sweat, and he yells over to the far sideline, \"Bring some water.\" James isn't officious; he doesn't treat these guys like valets. There's almost a collaborative feel to the session, even as he's enveloped in the full bass of his wireless Beats Solo2s. Handy collects the ball, then instructs James on the next sequence of choreography. James nods, then asks for clarification.\n\n\"Left twice, then right three times, and jab first?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\nA nation of basketball fans from Boston to Los Angeles have started to fill arenas 90 minutes before games to witness Stephen Curry's warm-up routine, but James has the place to himself. It's an empty, cold space this early, and James blows into his open fists.\n\n\"Down first or back?\" LeBron asks.\n\n\"One stab, one hard step back,\" Handy tells him.\n\nJames goes to work, concluding each rep with that patented little kick with his right toe. When he's in a groove, lyrics flow freely from his mouth. When he misses badly, it's \"Goddamit!\" A missed free throw draws, \"Ah, you bitch!\" Between sets, he consults with Handy on mechanics, then moves to the next spot.\n\n\"He's so coachable,\" Handy says. \"He's passionate about getting better, even at this stage.\"\n\nLeBron James toned down his antagonistic leadership style this season and has become more positive with teammates. David Sherman/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nLeBron is buying and selling, shipping and receiving. He personifies the new-age superstar athlete, a product of self-determination who doesn't just manage a personal brand, but leverages it. That salary he earns from Cavaliers Operating Company, LLC? Pocket change. His recent lifetime deal with Nike will feather his nest until his dying breath. A king's annuity. He has parked himself at the table for the upcoming collective bargaining agreement negotiations. He won't just earn a paycheck; he'll dictate the thickness and pattern of the checkbook.\n\nBut influence is a different currency, and down the hall Curry has started to amass his own fortune. There's the championship ring, at LeBron's expense. He's now the most prolific seller of player jerseys, also at LeBron's expense. On Christmas morning, the league announced the first All-Star ballot returns, and James had half as many votes as the man he succeeded in the spotlight, Kobe Bryant, and a 150,000 fewer than Steph.\n\n\"We don't talk, but we have a lot of respect for one another. I think he's special. He's very special. We all know that.\" LeBron James on Stephen Curry\n\nFans are fickle. They embrace novelty and nostalgia, shiny new objects and esteemed bronzed ones. But LeBron is neither new nor old, luminary nor upstart. He's the constant on a landscape that's shifting beneath him.\n\n\"Being the most influential player in the game, for him, is a challenge,\" says James Jones, whom LeBron calls his favorite player of all time. \"That's his goal. When you think about basketball from here on out, who was that one transcendent guy who you couldn't replicate, there was no other? When you have a LeBron James, a 6-8, 265-pound, point-forward scorer. There aren't very many of them. The game has to change, to find something else.\"\n\nThe game has found Curry, who has expanded the base of NBA fans. And just as LeBron pushed the league to reimagine how size, speed, vision, finesse and intuition could be packaged in a single player, Curry has redefined what constitutes a high-percentage shot -- and the people love it. They love that he looks like their brother's college roommate, love that every Warriors postseason tilt is bring-your-daughter-work day.\n\nLeBron's appeal isn't relatable, because he's not like you. His hulking body emerges from the training room an hour before the game, ankles taped, abs ripped, a tangle of sinewy muscle looking for a mountain to climb. He settles in at his locker, grabs the large Beats Pill speaker, and pumps Rich the Kid into the room. There's nowhere to hide from LeBron.\n\n\"No, we have no traditions,\" James says of his young family at Yuletide. \"If I can get a home game on Christmas, then we'll have a tradition.\"\n\nPlaying in a visiting building on Christmas Day is being twice-cursed for an NBA star. It's an assignment away from family, but also a cruel reminder that your previous season concluded with a loss. So here's LeBron, spending the holiday on a business trip in StephWorld.\n\n\"He's so coachable. He's passionate about getting better, even at this stage.\" Cavs' assistant Phil Handy on LeBron James\n\nAll week long, LeBron has insisted there's no added consequence to a game in late December, that you can't compare a sprightly shooter and a strapping forward who fight in different weight classes. The cosmic connection with Steph begins and ends with mutual admiration.\n\n\"We don't talk, but we have a lot of respect for one another,\" LeBron says. \"I think he's special. He's very special. We all know that.\"\n\nThe tribute is neither grudging nor demonstrative. It's the regard you have for a talented colleague at work who you never think to invite out for a drink. LeBron knows the talent business, so he must know that Steph is it, the comer in a league that celebrates -- no, relies on star power.\n\nBut there's no time for those considerations now, because Kevin Love is in trouble. He's under the basket with possession of the ball, but sandwiched between two of the league's best defenders, Andrew Bogut and Draymond Green. LeBron hears the alarm. He zips down an open lane of the hardwood to collect the ball for what could've been an easy bucket in a game with few. Love never shuttles a pass to LeBron, and gets stuffed by the Warrior hoagie. LeBron takes issue, but Love already knows he flubbed the play. The two slap hands as timeout is called, and it's all good.\n\nLast season, LeBron was a bear in the Cavs' locker room, quick to tag teammates as soft and to confront adversity with antagonism. Those who take note of such things say LeBron's turn to positive leadership this season has been apparent. So when he gets on Tristan Thompson after a botched set that drew Draymond Green rather than the less mobile Festus Ezeli for LeBron, it's a clinic, not a scolding. A few minutes later, LeBron draws Steph.\n\nThe game becomes still. LeBron holds the ball and surveys the scene over Steph's outstretched arms. It's two samurais standing with their swords drawn, both fully aware that whoever moves first forfeits the advantage. LeBron takes two jab steps in quick succession, one at 10 o'clock, the next at 2 o'clock, but Steph doesn't yield. With the shot clock set to expire, LeBron takes a single dribble and steps back for a 3-pointer that scrapes the roof but doesn't fall.\n\nAfter this moment, LeBron is a career 0-for-9 when guarded one-on-one by Steph .\n\nOn an individual and on a team level, Stephen Curry has recently gotten the better of LeBron James. Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n\n\"Obviously when you step on the court, you start to relive some of those moments but I haven't reflected much at all,\" LeBron says. \"It's a totally different stage.\"\n\nLeBron is right: The Christmas Day game produces a crescendo in the fourth quarter, but never reaches full climax. But for a few minutes down the stretch of a ragged, but reasonably close game, LeBron's mind and body wrest control of the game. This time, Steph can't possibly contend with the brute force that is LeBron rolling downhill to his left. Nor can Klay Thompson shake him off a curl, as LeBron shadows him to the basket, swatting away the remains of Thompson's drive at the rim.\n\nPhysicality still matters in the NBA, the way James controls his body, asserts his body, wields it against all comers. A superstar throws his weight around the basketball court and doesn't worry about casualties, which is how we end up with another uncontested slam by LeBron on the other end. Skill plus strength, intuition plus impulse. The Warriors might feature a collective roster of versatility, but don't you forget I was brandishing that versatility before the first splash.\n\n\"You can get into the era of analytics, you can get into the era of statistic, you can get into the era of small-ball, you can look at a lot of different things, but there's one thing you can't ever replace is the type of player you can put in any system and have those players thrive, and he embodies the versatility,\" says Jones. \"That's what makes him unique -- no slight to any other player. That's what sets him apart. I think it's hard for the casual fan to appreciate that. They might not see the nuance.\"\n\nLeBron interlaces his thick fingers and presses both palms into the crown of his head. He has just missed two free throws late in the fourth quarter that could've given the Cavs a fighting chance. There's no \"Ah, you bitch,\" no histrionics. Just a long stare into middle distance, with almost a resigned smile.\n\n\"I had a couple of plays I wish I could get back,\" he tells a confidant in the locker room, which was notably unbothered by another loss to Golden State. The Cavs didn't drop the game because the Warriors were a younger, more innovative team. They lost because they couldn't hit a shot.\n\n\"I didn't put too much into it,\" he says. \"I told the guys on the bench, 'Don't put too much pressure into this one game.'\"\n\nIt's a struggle to imagine that this picture of strength also harbors human frailty, and if it's hard for us, imagine what it must be for him. Over the course of any career, youthful exuberance mellows and talent grows into itself. Who knows exactly when that happened for LeBron. Forty-eight points in the double-overtime win over Detroit in the 2006-07 conference finals? The night of the first title in 2012? Trying to pinpoint an exact instant is impossible, but somewhere along the way -- and not so long ago -- LeBron became the league's elder statesman. The emergence of Stephen Curry as NBA supernova might have been that moment, as his ascent pushes LeBron into a position of seniority.\n\nAnd with that comes LeBron's first brush with basketball mortality.", "Nicholas Walters, Jason Sosa junior lightweight bout scored controversial majority draw": "VERONA, N.Y. -- Former featherweight titlist Nicholas \"Axe Man\" Walters moved up in weight to junior lightweight and put on a power-punching clinic in what appeared to be a rout of tough Jason Sosa on Saturday night on the Luis Ortiz-Bryant Jennings undercard at the Turning Stone Resort Casino.\n\nIn the end, however, the fight was shockingly scored a majority draw, with two judges, Don Ackerman and Wynn Kintz, scoring the fight 95-95, and the third judge, Tom Schreck, scoring it an even more stunning 96-94 for Sosa. ESPN.com had it 100-90 for Walters, who appeared to dominate from the opening bell and put a beating on Sosa.\n\n\"They all stink. They shouldn't judge again,\" said Carl Moretti, vice president of Top Rank, which promotes Walters and Sosa.\n\nHarold Lederman, HBO's unofficial judge, who was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame this week, had it 99-91 in favor of Walters.\n\nRingside media also had Walters winning by overwhelmingly wide decision.\n\nNicholas Walters, left, put on a punching clinic on Jason Sosa and appeared on his way to a clear decision win, but two judges stunningly scored an even fight, giving the outclassed Sosa a draw. Ed DIller for ESPN\n\nAccording to CompuBox punch statistics, Walters landed 281 of 622 punches (45 percent), and Sosa landed 168 of 873 (19 percent). Walters also led 118 to 39 in body punches landed.\n\n\"I'm in total shock. I just can't believe it,\" Walters said. \"I was in total control of the fight. He was a good fighter, but I was never in any danger. I was never hurt, and I just can't believe it.\"\n\nSosa said he thought he won the fight, even though Walters outlanded him in every round.\n\n\"I thought I won the fight,\" Sosa said. \"I was more active, I was more aggressive, I got better shots in, so I'm disappointed it was a draw.\"\n\nWalters was fighting for the first time since being stripped of his world title for failing to make the 126-pound featherweight limit for a defense against amateur nemesis Miguel Marriaga in June. Walters won the fight handily but saw a planned fall title unification fight against Vasyl Lomachenko go down the drain. So Walters, who claims he can still make 126 pounds, moved up to the 130-pound junior lightweight division to take on Sosa, a hard puncher with limited experience, facing his first quality opponent. It turned out to be a one-sided mismatch.\n\nEven though Walters, 29, of Jamaica, was moving up in weight, he looked like the bigger, stronger fighter. He also had the quicker hands and tagged Sosa with some nice right hands and uppercuts throughout the fight.\n\nPunch stats Punches Walters Sosa Landed 281 168 Thrown 622 873 Percent 45% 19% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\nBy the end of the third round, Sosa's nose was red. Walters (26-0-1, 21 KOs) continued to land the cleaner, straighter punches and also was relentless with his body attack. Early in the fifth round, Walters rocked Sosa (18-1-4, 14 KOs) with a counter right hand and was in total control.\n\nWalters continued to pour it on in the seventh round, buckling Sosa early in the frame with a right hand. Sosa, 27, of Camden, New Jersey, took a lot of punishment but was hanging in there and giving a great effort, but the chasm in talent was obvious.\n\nSosa had some success in the ninth round, but Walters closed the round with Sosa on the ropes and eating more punches.\n\nBefore the fight, there was talk that the winner could face 36-year-old world titleholder Takashi Uchiyama (23-0-1, 19 KOs), of Japan, who has reigned since January 2010 and will defend his belt for the 11th time on Dec. 31 against Nicaragua's Oliver Flores (27-1-2, 17 KOs) in Tokyo.", "DeMarcus Cousins of Sacramento Kings facing NBA discipline": "DeMarcus Cousins is called for his fifth foul of the game and does not agree with it at all. He then receives a technical foul and an ejection from the game after he charged at the referee in which he had to be held back by Rudy Gay. (1:05)\n\nSacramento Kings general manager Vlade Divac said Monday night that he expects DeMarcus Cousins to be suspended by the league after his latest outburst at referees.\n\nCousins was in foul trouble early and often Monday night against the Golden State Warriors, getting whistled three times in the first quarter.\n\nAfter sitting out most of the first half with foul trouble, Cousins was upset when he was called for his fifth foul in the third quarter. Monty McCutchen then called Cousins for a technical, setting him off on a tirade that led to another technical called by Mitchell Ervin and an ejection. Cousins had to be restrained by teammates before being escorted off the court.\n\nCousins was not available to the media after the game, a 122-103 win by Golden State, which went on a 15-0 run after the technicals to pull away.\n\nDivac said he spoke with Cousins after the game.\n\n\"He said he understands what he did, but he didn't do anything wrong in my opinion,\" Divac said, according to The Sacramento Bee.\n\nKings coach George Karl also didn't think Cousins' play merited whistles.\n\n\"It just seemed to me there were cute, soft fouls called on DeMarcus and he got his fifth and he lost his cool,\" Karl said.\n\nAccording to Stats & Information, Cousins has been ejected 10 times, assessed 77 technical fouls and issued six suspensions (five by league/one by team).

Photo: Dan Seaton | VeloNews.com\n\nYou take off your shoes when you enter Klaas Vantornout\u2019s trailer. The 33-year-old Belgian cyclocross champion may be at home on the bike in the muddiest conditions, but away from it he is fastidious, and the bright white leather upholstery and carpet of his home away from home at the races shows no evidence of the mess outside. Nor does he, sitting comfortably on the sofa in a pair of well-tailored, light blue jeans and a white Sunweb-Napoleon Games team-issue jacket.\n\nBut there is a mess, both literal \u2014 Belgian cyclocross\u2019s legendary mud \u2014 and figurative. Vantornout, halfway through his second career turn in the tricolor Belgian champion\u2019s jersey, is suffering through one of his more unhappy cyclocross seasons in recent memory. That\u2019s how it looks from the outside anyway. Vantornout, never the kind of rider who gushes effusively about the ups and downs of his season, is always hard to read.\n\nHis reticence might explain the paradoxical trajectory of his career. Vantornout, by any measure, is one of the most successful cyclocross racers in the world. Before this season of frustration came big results: two Belgian national championships (2013, 2015) and two silver medals at the world championships. In 2010, Vantornout finished second to Zdenek Stybar in Tabor, Czech Republic. In Louisville, three years later, Vantornout might well have won a hard-fought duel with Sven Nys if not for a momentary bobble near the end of the final lap. But in spite of all this he is probably the least well-know Belgian champion in cyclocross in decades, especially among fans of the sport outside cyclocross\u2019 European heartland.\n\nRiding for any other country, Vantornout\u2019s achievements would rank as an unparalleled success, but in Belgium, he has seen his star occulted by men who will be remembered as legends of the sport: Sven Nys, Niels Albert, and \u2014 most likely \u2014 Wout Van Aert. It\u2019s not that he is unpopular \u2014 far from it. Vantornout has a dedicated and vocal following, especially among fans from West Flanders, Vantornout\u2019s home, and Belgians will always support a rider in the Driekleur, the tri-color national champion\u2019s jersey.\n\nBut Vantornout, tall and lanky with close-cropped auburn hair, a sharp jaw, and deep-set, crystal blue eyes that are simultaneously penetrating and gentle, is undeniably one of the sport\u2019s most inscrutable riders. He is soft-spoken and seems intensely thoughtful, but he possesses neither the gregariousness that powered Bart Wellens\u2019s popularity nor the pure, unstoppable dominance that is behind Sven Nys\u2019s extraordinary following.\n\nIn fact, Vantornout\u2019s problem of public perception \u2014 if he has one at all \u2014 seems to be that he\u2019s just an introvert, a thoughtful, reflective guy focused mostly on how to make himself better in a sport known for colorful, outspoken characters.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of people know me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know me only from here, from the races, but outside they don\u2019t know me. I\u2019m a normal guy, I\u2019m playing with my little girl \u2014 she\u2019s now five years, it\u2019s very nice. She helps me forget about all the pressure and the \u2018crosses.\u201d\n\nSport rewards winning overall, but it also rewards the big personalities. Vantornout, inward-looking by nature, is perennially seen as an outsider, in spite of being a highly capable rider. To the Belgian media, he is easy to cast as the heavy, the guy who races angry and \u2014 maybe \u2014 a bit dangerously.\n\nIt\u2019s an image a recent report by the Belgian TV network Sporza suggested, and one he has sometimes even reinforced himself, used to his advantage in the psychological battle that can help win the physical one.\n\nMaybe so, but the image also seems to have cost him this year. In an unusual turn for a Belgian champion, Vantornout did not receive a start contract for the Bpost Bank Trofee series, one of world\u2019s biggest cyclocross series, along with the Superprestige and World Cup.\n\nIn Belgium, where a significant fraction of cyclocross stars\u2019 annual income derives from appearance fees, it was a costly turn that touched off a minor scandal at the start of the season. Vantornout\u2019s struggles did not help either. He missed the second World Cup stop, in Valkenburg, Netherlands, then returned the following weekend only to be injured in a heavy fall at the Superprestige stop in Zonhoven. The injury cost him a start at the Koppenberg, one of the biggest races in cyclocross.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my best period, you can see it in the results,\u201d he told VeloNews in an interview earlier this season, in the middle of that downward skid.\n\n\u201cIn cyclocross, you know, you must be 100 percent in condition, and if it\u2019s not 100 percent you feel it directly from the start,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially with the young people now. It was necessary. I was ill; they were taking my blood, and it was very bad.\u201d\n\nIt was a rough patch that the Belgian press blew far out of proportion, he said then.\n\n\u201cI was a week a little bit ill,\u201d says Vantornout of his brief step back from racing in October. \u201cIt was not very ill, but every day the press and the newspaper is \u2018blah blah blah,\u2019 and it\u2019s making me not popular. But it\u2019s always the same with the press and me. When I\u2019m doing something, they are there.\u201d\n\nNow, after three rough months, he seems to have turned the conversation around. On the Formula One track in Francorchamps-Spa \u2014 a race that in its second year has emerged as one of the most difficult in the sport \u2014 Vantornout was at the front of the chase, battling with Sven Nys and teammate Kevin Pauwels for podium places behind cyclocross\u2019s new king, Wout Van Aert. Vantornout missed out on the podium by one spot. In the Namur World Cup race, he again finished fourth.\n\nReportedly, Vantornout took some motivation from world champion Mathieu van der Poel\u2019s own struggles with a knee injury earlier this season. Vantornout said that he and Van der Poel shared some common interests outside the sport and had talked periodically during the early part of the season.\n\nVan der Poel, 20, who himself took a big step forward with an impressive win in Namur, told reporters that Vantornout was one of the only riders from whom he had received real support during his absence from racing.\n\nFor Vantornout, this all comes as a most welcome change. The Belgian Driekleur weighs heavy when the results aren\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cWhen you are good, everything is good,\u201d he says. \u201cThe hardest moment in cyclocross with the jersey is when you are riding in 10th position. Then it\u2019s very hard mentally.\u201d\n\nStill, he says, whatever his frustrations have been, he feels little pressure as a result of his status as champion of what amounts to the national sport. He takes pleasure in the results \u2014 when they flow \u2014 and puts it out of mind when the results aren\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 33 years old,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a lot of experience with it. It\u2019s a hard world, it\u2019s a small world, but I\u2019m 33 years, and I\u2019m so long in the world of cyclocross. I know the world. If I win a big race, that\u2019s for me the best days. I\u2019m two times the Belgian champion. Last year I was winning in Gavere, a very nice race, and I was alone at the finish.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that win in Gavere will be Vantornout\u2019s last, especially with his form coming around just as the 2015-16 season approaches its climax. But whatever happens, Vantornout says he has few regrets. He says would like to earn a set of rainbow stripes, especially at what will probably be his last championships on home soil, in Zolder, Belgium, later this season. But he acknowledges that will be a hard race to win, and won\u2019t complain about a career that has taken him about as far anybody could ever hope to go.\n\n\u201cI started cycling when I was 13 years old,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd from when I was 16 I was more and more riding in the cyclocross, but then it was not so popular like now. Now you have all the young teams, every big team has a young team for the nieuweling and the juniors, but I was doing it on my own. My parents paid for my bike, they brought me to the races. Now if you are 16, they give him two bikes and six pairs of wheels. It\u2019s a little bit crazy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my career. \u2026 It was a very difficult way, but step by step I was growing. My rivals from the juniors or the [under-23s], they are all stopped now and I was always, every year, going step by step higher and higher.\u201d\n\nThen, uncharacteristically for a rider known for the stony intensity he brings to the starting line every week, he cracks a joke at his own expense.\n\n\u201cMaybe now the step is down and down,\u201d he laughs.\n\nIt\u2019s a joke, but a more serious undercurrent flows beneath it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t race so many more years on this level,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe I do my best the next two years. I have a contract until the end of 2016, then we see. I don\u2019t know. [I\u2019ll be] 35 and I won\u2019t ride until I\u2019m 40. I can\u2019t do [what Sven Nys did] he\u2019s a special man.\u201d\n\nWhatever the next two seasons bring, whether they are successful or the frustrations continue, whether they are his last two seasons or not, Vantornout will not complain. He is lucky, he has lived a dream life, and he knows it.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, acknowledging the stress of the past several seasons. \u201cYes, you must have results and you have a lot of pressure. Yeah, that\u2019s part of the job. But every job has something negative. This is my hobby and I can live from it. My bike [has always been] my hobby, and now it\u2019s my job the last eight years. I\u2019m a happy man.\u201d\n\nFILED UNDER: Cyclocross TAGS: Klaas Vantornout", "Path to the playoffs: AL West": "The American League should again be fascinating. While the National League is split between the haves and the have-nots, it's not difficult to imagine a path to the playoffs for all 15 AL teams. The 2015 AL had as much parity as any league ever, with 12 of the 15 teams bunched between 74 and 88 wins. The AL West in 2016 will be no different. The Rangers and Astros will likely be co-favorites, but any of the five teams could win the division -- even the A's.\n\nTexas Rangers\n\n2015: 88-74, plus-18 run differential, lost in Division Series\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 83-79\n\n2015 payroll: $156.2 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $144.1 million\n\nThe Rangers weren't exactly the plucky little engine that could of 2015, although it kind of felt like that. Yu Darvish, Derek Holland and Matt Harrison combined for just 13 starts, and the team went 7-14 in April. The Rangers still rallied to go 46-28 in the second half and pull out the division title.\n\nSo, the path to the playoffs? Stick with the second-half game plan, throw in a full season from Cole Hamels and hope Darvish can return in May.\n\nIt's not that easy, of course. Other than Yovani Gallardo, all the primary players are back, but the offense depends on 37-year-old Adrian Beltre, 33-year-old Shin-Soo Choo, 32-year-old Prince Fielder and maybe 35-year-old Josh Hamilton. Other than Beltre, they all hit left-handed, as do Rougned Odor and Mitch Moreland. While the Rangers had pretty even splits a year ago, you still worry about their ability to hit left-handers.\n\nGiven the age of the offensive core, the Rangers may need more from the rotation, which finished 11th in the AL in ERA in 2015. That's certainly possible with Hamels, Darvish and a healthy Holland, plus Martin Perez now further removed from Tommy John surgery. Colby Lewis also was brought back to be a veteran innings-eater.\n\nStill, given the uncertainty of the rotation, GM Jon Daniels has stockpiled relievers. The additions of Sam Dyson and Jake Diekman at the trade deadline gave them two late-inning power arms behind closer Shawn Tolleson. Keone Kela impressed as a rookie and Tom Wilhelmsen was acquired for Leonys Martin. The closer remains uncertain -- I'd bet on Dyson eventually taking the job -- but it's the depth that's important. If the Rangers get great starting pitching and great relieving, they're going to be tough to beat. If either falters ...\n\nHouston Astros\n\n2015: 86-76, plus-111 run differential, won wild-card game, lost in Division Series\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 88-74\n\n2015 payroll: $82.4 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $88.9 million\n\nThe Astros had the sixth-best bullpen ERA in the majors and the third-best strikeout rate in 2015. They were 70-5 when leading after seven innings and 73-1 when leading after eight. Then came the Game 4 collapse against the Royals in the Division Series. Enter new closer Ken Giles.\n\nThat's a trade that may have more impact in the playoffs than the regular season. So all the Astros have to do is get back there. That's a fun path to consider:\n\n1. A full season from Carlos Correa after a .279/.345/.512 debut.\n\n2. A full season from George Springer, who quietly posted a .826 OPS while cutting his strikeout rate 9 percent from his rookie season.\n\n3. A full season from Carlos Gomez in center field. He didn't hit well for the Astros after the trade with the Brewers -- injuries likely were a factor -- but he's one year removed from two terrific seasons.\n\n4. Better production at DH and first base. The Astros were 21st in wOBA at first base and jettisoned Chris Carter, and for now they're banking on Jonathan Singleton or A.J. Reed. They were ninth in the AL in wOBA at DH, although Evan Gattis returns there. Expect to see Preston Tucker getting more time there.\n\nAdd all that up and the Astros could get better production from four positions.\n\nOh, and they allowed the fewest runs in the AL.\n\nLos Angeles Angels\n\n2015: 85-77, minus-14 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 83-79\n\n2015 payroll: $149.7 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $166.8 million\n\nThe Angels fell from first in the AL in runs in 2014 to 12th in 2015, scoring 112 fewer. Hey, don't blame Mike Trout.\n\nWhile they traded for Andrelton Simmons, that helps the run prevention more than the offense. The rotation has depth in numbers but will head into 2016 counting on C.J. Wilson (had surgery to remove bone chips in his elbow), Jered Weaver (4.64 ERA) and Matt Shoemaker (4.46 ERA). But the rotation could certainly be improved: Garrett Richards has the stuff to return to his 2014 form, Andrew Heaney had a solid rookie season and Nick Tropeano is a nice sleeper.\n\nThe key, however, is to score more runs. So far they've traded for Yunel Escobar (who replaces David Freese at third base) and gone the discount route with Geovany Soto, Daniel Nava, Craig Gentry and Cliff Pennington. What's not clear: Is owner Arte Moreno going to buy one of the free-agent corner outfielders out there? Justin Upton, Alex Gordon or Yoenis Cespedes would provide some much-needed support for the best player in baseball. Note the Angels' biggest problem: Of the team's regulars, only Trout had an OBP over .323. Albert Pujols and Kole Calhoun combined for 66 home runs but OBPs of .307 and .308.\n\nSeattle Mariners\n\n2015: 76-86, minus-70 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 84-78\n\n2015 payroll: $124.4 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $138.7 million\n\nNew general manager Jerry Dipoto has been the busiest man in baseball this offseason, trying to turn an aging core of Felix Hernandez, Robinson Cano and Nelson Cruz into a playoff team without the benefit of a strong minor league system to deal from or the luxury of payroll flexibility to sign a big free agent.\n\nHis first goal was to improve the defense, which ranked next-to-last in the majors in defensive runs saved. He acquired Leonys Martin to play center field; Martin didn't hit with the Rangers in 2015 but is an elite defender. Eight players appeared in center field for the Mariners in 2015, combining for an atrocious minus-25 DRS. If Martin is a plus-15 defender, that could be a 40-run swing in center field alone. Cruz and Mark Trumbo are out of right field, with Norichika Aoki in. Ketel Marte will assume shortstop duties over Brad Miller. The Mariners won't be a superior defensive team but they should be better.\n\nThe Mariners scored their most runs since 2008, thanks in large part to Cruz hitting .302 with 44 home runs. Unfortunately, they still ranked just 13th in the AL. Sure, Safeco is a bit of an offensive drain, but they have to generate more runs. Again, Dipoto has tried to make the team a little more athletic and focused on guys with OBP skills: In are Aoki and Adam Lind, out are Trumbo and Logan Morrison. Mariners catchers hit .159/.205/.259 in 2015 -- not a misprint. Mike Zunino will try to revive his game in Triple-A, with Chris Iannetta and Steve Clevenger taking over. That's not a great duo but the Mariners could easily get 20 more runs created from the catcher spot.\n\nYou get the idea. It's all about incremental improvements across the board. The rotation even has more depth after Hisashi Iwakuma ended up back in Seattle after his deal with the Dodgers was never finalized. He has to be considered an obvious health risk. The one player on the roster who could take a big leap from 2015: Taijuan Walker, who struggled early but had a 3.62 ERA in his final 20 starts.\n\nThis gets us to the bullpen -- the biggest unknown on this team, and a good bet to make or break the season. Sound familiar? The Mariners had 36 bullpen losses in 2015, second most in the majors (and just 21 wins). Steve Cishek, coming off a season when his fastball velocity dropped a bit, will get a chance at closing. Joaquin Benoit is the new setup guy. Charlie Furbush needs to stay healthy. Evan Scribner and Justin De Fratus were buy-low guys coming off bad seasons. They give up fly balls and home runs: Dipoto is counting on Safeco to help them out.\n\nOakland Athletics\n\n2015: 68-94, minus-35 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 80-82\n\n2015 payroll: $84.2 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $79.5 million\n\nWell, let's see: The A's could trade for Josh Donaldson and Addison Russell and sign Cespedes and Scott Kazmir ...\n\nEveryone will pick the A's to finish last. So how do they finish first?\n\n1. Better bullpen. The pen went 21-31 last year with a 4.63 ERA. Only the Braves and Rockies had a worse ERA. A healthy Sean Doolittle will help, but the front office also signed veterans Ryan Madson and John Axford and traded for Liam Hendriks, who had a strong year for Toronto.\n\n2. Rich Hill is for real. Remember him? He had a decent year for the Cubs ... back in 2007. He actually has appeared in every major league season since then, although he has pitched just 182 innings. He made four late-season starts for the Red Sox, with a 1.55 ERA, 36 strikeouts and five walks in 29 innings. The A's signed him to a one-year, $6 million contract.\n\n3. A full season from Jesse Hahn. The right-hander went down in July with a flexor tendon injury in his elbow. The A's were conservative and shut him down for the season, but he'd posted a 3.35 ERA in 16 starts. He has the stuff and ground ball rate to be a solid complement to Sonny Gray.\n\n4. Offense in left field. A's left fielders hit .199/.268/.338 in 2015. Only the Angels had a worse OPS. It's not clear who the answer is out there. Defensive specialist Sam Fuld is still on the 40-man roster. Coco Crisp is still around after playing just 44 games in 2015. Maybe they go bargain-basement shopping for another option.\n\n5. More offense in the infield. Brett Lawrie is out and Eric Sogard appears relegated to the bench -- Lawrie had a .299 OBP and Sogard a .294 OBP in a part-time role. In are Danny Valencia -- who hit .284/.356/.530 in 47 games with the A's -- and Jed Lowrie.\n\nLook, it's hard to envision this being a top-five offense in the league, so it will likely come down to the run prevention. The A's have a young rotation and if they all emerge this year ... well, to quote the great Joaquin Andujar, you never know.", "College Football Playoff Preview: Clemson\u2019s One-Man Offense vs. The Balanced Sooners": "Clemson and Oklahoma square off on New Year\u2019s Eve in a matchup that pits the nation\u2019s only remaining undefeated team (the Tigers) against the favorite according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s college football model (the Sooners). Both teams have a strong defense, but on offense they\u2019re a contrast. Clemson has a one-man scoring machine in dual-threat quarterback Deshaun Watson. Oklahoma, on the other hand, is evenly balanced between a nifty passing attack and two strong running backs. In fact, the Sooners are one of the more balanced teams in recent college football history.\n\nClemson: Deshaun Watson is a one-man offense\n\nUndefeated, No. 1-ranked Clemson enters the College Football Playoff with two major advantages: a top-notch defense and a star quarterback. The Tigers\u2019 offensive attack is led by Deshaun Watson, a Heisman finalist and electric dual-threat quarterback in the vein of Johnny Manziel and Cam Newton. And like Manziel and Newton, Watson has carried his team into the national spotlight seemingly by himself.\n\nAccording to ESPN\u2019s Total Quarterback Rating (QBR), Watson is the third-highest-rated quarterback in the nation. (By adjusting for opponent strength, QBR aims to be a comprehensive measure of QB performance.) The only QBs to rate higher than Watson are Brandon Allen, of five-loss Arkansas, and Baylor\u2019s Seth Russell, who suffered a season-ending injury after seven excellent games. Watson\u2019s raw stats are also impressive: He has accumulated more than 3,500 yards and 30 passing touchdowns through the air, along with another 887 yards (5.4 yards per carry) and 11 rushing touchdowns on the ground.\n\nOverall, Watson is responsible for 66 percent of Clemon\u2019s total offensive yards (passing and rushing combined). Considering how efficiently he has played (shown by QBR) and how much of the offensive burden he has shouldered, Watson\u2019s season is quite the outlier.\n\nWatson\u2019s excellence under a heavy all-around workload puts him in rare company. He is one of 14 quarterbacks over the past 11 seasons (shown in the table below) to post a season QBR of 75 or higher while also rushing for at least 30 percent of his team\u2019s total yards on the ground. The only quarterbacks to post better QBR numbers while running as much: Manziel (twice), Pat White and Newton. And Watson is a sophomore, meaning that \u2014 like Manziel \u2014 he could end up on this list again.\n\nIs Deshaun Watson the new Johnny Manziel?

Deshaun Watson is the rare QB who excels at being a one-man offense.\n\nOklahoma: The balanced Sooners are favorites\n\nOklahoma is our model\u2019s favorite to win the College Football Playoff, with a 41 percent chance at the national championship. If the Sooners do take home the trophy, it will likely be due to a stellar effort on both offense and defense. This isn\u2019t exactly a novel conceit \u2014 every team needs both units to play well to succeed at the highest levels \u2014 but it\u2019s particularly true for Oklahoma, one of the most balanced teams in recent college football history.\n\nOverall, Oklahoma is very good, rating well in all the fashionable advanced metrics. The Sooners sit at No. 1 in ESPN\u2019s Football Power Index, which FiveThirtyEight\u2019s college football model uses for game predictions. Oklahoma is also the top team according to Football Perspective\u2019s Simple Rating System. And according to our Elo ratings, the Sooners are the fifth-best squad.\n\nThat\u2019s all remarkable, in the usual ways a championship-level team is remarkable; what\u2019s less common, though, is Oklahoma\u2019s balance. The Sooners are the only team in the country to rate in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On offense, quarterback Baker Mayfield leads a sharp passing attack, with heavy utilization of All-American receiver Sterling Shepard. Buttressing that efficiency through the air is an impressive running back duo of Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon, who have combined for more than 2,000 yards this year. The Sooner defense, led by standout linebacker Eric Striker, can crimp offenses in several ways \u2014 it\u2019s in the top 10 among all FBS teams in both sacks and interceptions.\n\nOne way to look at team balance historically is to define it as the absolute gap between a team\u2019s offensive and defensive efficiency ratings. Going back to the 2005 season among teams in the top four in overall efficiency, these Sooners are the second-most-balanced team of the decade. Only the 2013 Alabama squad had a smaller gap between its offense and defense.\n\nBalance of elite college football teams, 2005-15 EFFICIENCY RANK SEASON TEAM OFFENSE DEFENSE GAP 1 2013 Alabama 85.7 85.9 0.2 2 2015 Oklahoma 83.3 83.0 0.3 3 2006 USC 79.0 79.6 0.6 4 2010 Boise State 87.8 86.9 0.9 5 2012 Alabama 90.3 91.2 0.9 6 2007 West Virginia 78.5 77.6 0.9 7 2006 Ohio State 83.3 82.1 1.2 8 2014 Alabama 84.9 82.5 2.4 9 2008 USC 89.4 86.6 2.8 10 2013 FSU 93.5 89.2 4.3 11 2011 Boise State 82.4 77.5 4.9 12 2008 Florida 91.4 86.4 5.0 13 2007 Kansas 74.1 79.2 5.1 14 2015 Clemson 81.3 87.1 5.8 15 2009 Florida 80.1 86.0 5.9 16 2012 Oregon 88.3 81.7 6.6 17 2010 Ohio State 80.0 87.0 7.0 18 2005 Texas 92.0 85.0 7.0 19 2010 Alabama 87.7 79.1 8.6 20 2005 Penn State 74.0 83.4 9.4 21 2012 FSU 74.3 83.8 9.5 22 2011 Oklahoma State 88.1 78.4 9.7 23 2006 LSU 85.0 75.1 9.9 24 2013 Baylor 87.9 77.8 10.1 25 2005 Ohio State 73.3 83.7 10.4 26 2008 Texas 89.0 77.6 11.4 27 2014 TCU 75.8 88.0 12.2 28 2009 TCU 70.2 82.6 12.4 29 2007 USC 71.1 83.5 12.4 30 2014 Ohio State 87.5 74.9 12.6 31 2009 Alabama 77.3 89.9 12.6 32 2015 Ohio State 67.0 80.6 13.6 33 2011 LSU 76.6 90.2 13.6 34 2011 Alabama 80.4 94.5 14.1 35 2010 Stanford 91.9 76.4 15.5 36 2008 Oklahoma 95.3 79.2 16.1 37 2013 Oregon 87.7 71.3 16.4 38 2012 Texas A&M 91.3 74.6 16.7 39 2005 USC 95.8 78.7 17.1 40 2014 Oregon 91.3 69.9 21.4 41 2009 Texas 67.4 89.1 21.7 42 2015 Alabama 70.8 92.9 22.1 43 2006 BYU 90.0 64.5 25.5 44 2007 Florida 93.1 49.8 43.3 Source: ESPN\n\nOf course, offense and defense aren\u2019t all there is to football. And on special teams, the Sooners aren\u2019t quite so intimidating or balanced. Frankly, they\u2019re bad. Oklahoma is ranked No. 93 of 128 FBS teams.\n\nAt least broadly, it looks like Oklahoma is on to something here. The correlation between overall efficiency and the gap between offense and defense among all teams is strong and negative, meaning the less balanced a team is, the worse it performs. This isn\u2019t an effect of talent imbalance among worse schools, either: Among the top 25 teams in overall efficiency in each season since 2005, the more efficient teams have been slightly more balanced as well, though the relationship is weaker here.\n\nIf Oklahoma wins out and reconfirms FiveThirtyEight\u2019s soothsaying abilities, it will likely go down as one of the least one-dimensional teams that college football has seen in quite some time. Perhaps this style doesn\u2019t produce the same thrilling, back-and-forth games the best imbalanced squads play, like that ridiculous 2007 Gators season (Tim Tebow\u2019s first as a full-time starter), but its effectiveness isn\u2019t in doubt.\n\nRead more: Alabama\u2019s Dominant Run Attack vs. A Lucky Michigan State Team", "Chip Kelly's Philadelphia Eagles further behind NFC contenders": "PHILADELPHIA -- Statistics can be illuminating or misleading, sometimes a little of both.\n\nThis one is certainly telling. The Arizona Cardinals are the only team in the NFL that has scored touchdowns more often than they have punted. The Cardinals have scored 57 touchdowns and punted the ball away 55 times.\n\nSo how do Chip Kelly\u2019s Philadelphia Eagles compare? It\u2019s a fair question, since Kelly was billed as an offensive mastermind who was going to revolutionize the NFL. And the Cardinals, along with the Carolina Panthers and Seattle Seahawks, are the class of the NFC. They are one of the teams the Eagles must surpass in order to become a Super Bowl contender.\n\nWith 43 more punts than touchdowns, the Eagles don't seem especially close to being an elite team. Grant Halverson/Getty Images\n\nKelly reiterated his argument that time of possession is a meaningless statistic. His offense has run the most plays in the NFL, and Kelly maintains that is more important than time spent in possession of the football.\n\nBut points are the ultimate measure of a team. Scoring is the objective of the game. And the Eagles have a long way to go to compete with teams like Arizona and Carolina.\n\nThe Eagles have scored a total of 40 touchdowns this season -- 21 passes, 13 rushes and six via defensive or special teams returns. They have punted 83 times, more than twice as often as they have reached the end zone.\n\nArizona\u2019s numbers are not typical. They are the only team with more touchdowns than punts.\n\nPittsburgh and Carolina are tied with 14 more punts than touchdowns. New England is right behind them with 15 more punts than touchdowns.\n\nThose are playoff-bound teams. The Eagles are not. With 43 more punts than touchdowns, they don\u2019t seem especially close to being an elite team. Worse, they have regressed in Kelly\u2019s third season.\n\nIn 2013, Kelly\u2019s first season, the Eagles scored 53 touchdowns and punted 82 times. Last year, the Eagles scored 54 total touchdowns and punted just 76 times.\n\nBased on their season averages, the Eagles would finish this season with 43 touchdowns and 89 punts.", "Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James moves into 17th on NBA's all-time scoring list": "PHOENIX -- Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James passed Alex English for 17th on the NBA's all-time leading scoring list during Cleveland's 101-97 win over the Phoenix Suns on Monday.\n\nEditor's Picks McMenamin: Big night for Irving masks mediocre performance from Cavs Kyrie Irving had his best game since his return from injury, but the Cavaliers were listless in general in a close win over Phoenix.\n\nJames came into the night needing five points to pass English's career total of 25,613 points.

There have been a lot of great times. I've been really lucky. I would have never imagined I would have been in this job this long. It's been good. The anecdotes, I wouldn't even know where to start.\"\n\nShawn Thornton spent parts of 10 seasons playing in the AHL. Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n\nHere's one that reached legendary status:\n\nDuring the 1947-48 season, the Indianapolis Capitals' Lloyd \"Red\" Doran viciously swung his stick at the head of the Providence Reds' Chuck Scherza, who needed 17 stitches to repair the damage. Every time the teams played after that, whether in Indy or Providence, Doran never played, the Capitals protecting their player from retribution.\n\nLater, when the Reds were playing in Indianapolis, Scherza was walking down the street before the game when he spotted Doran in a restaurant. Scherza walked in and, without saying a word, Scherza punched Doran in the face, knocking him off his chair. As Scherza walked out, legend has it someone yelled, \"He probably deserved it!\"\n\nTwo-time Stanley Cup winner and current Florida Panthers forward Shawn Thornton spent parts of 10 seasons in the AHL. One of his all-time favorite teammates was Greg Smyth, better known as \"Bird Dog.\"\n\n\"His last year [1998-99], he played only 40 games because I'm pretty sure he was suspended for the other 40,\" said Thornton, 38. \"He was the craziest guy I have ever played with my whole life.\"\n\nOne day before a game in Fredericton, the Canadiens (the affiliate of the Montreal Canadiens) were holding their usual morning skate. Then-coach Michel Therrien decided to stay on the ice a bit longer than their allotted time.\n\nSmyth, who recorded 1,970 penalty minutes in 361 career AHL games, felt the Canadiens were out of line.\n\n\"He just left the room and we thought he was going to talk with our coach or something, and all we hear is loud bangs and chaos,\" Thornton said. \"He comes walking back in five minutes later and said, 'The ice will be ready in a second, guys.' Come to find out, he went on the ice with just his lower gear and skates on and just started taking slap shots at their whole coaching staff and extra players.\"\n\nFredericton's tough guys at the time -- Terry Ryan and Dave Morissette -- were in the locker room when they heard the commotion and came running out to the bench.\n\n\"[Smyth] started firing slappers at those guys and they're ducking like they're getting shot at,\" Thornton said. \"Pucks were flying all over the place.

Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nMost players don't spend a lot of time in the AHL these days due to the NHL's salary-cap system and entry-level contracts. But before the cap, many Hall of Famers spent countless seasons toiling in the AHL.\n\nHall of Fame goaltender Johnny Bower won four Stanley Cups with the Toronto Maple Leafs, but before that, he won three Calder Cup championships with the Cleveland Barons in the AHL. He spent 11 seasons in the AHL at different times during his pro career, making his NHL debut at age 29 with the New York Rangers in 1953-54. After a few more trips back to the minors, the Maple Leafs claimed him in 1958-59 and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nBesides the memories of his championships and his teammates cutting the laces in his shoes and skates, Bower, now 91, remembers the grind.\n\n\"It was a tough go for me, a tough struggle of mine because my dream was always to make the National Hockey League and win a Stanley Cup,\" Bower said.\n\nWith just six NHL teams in those days, many talented players were stuck in the AHL, including Bower.\n\n\"I just kept working at it and my dream came true,\" he said.\n\nAlong with the four Stanley Cups in Toronto, he won the Vezina Trophy twice and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1976.\n\n\"I fooled them here in Toronto and I played 12 years,\" Bower said with a laugh. \"That's where hard works comes from, and I worked really hard to do it.

Gordon Chibroski/Portland Press Herald/Getty Images\n\nThe AHL has been helping players reach the ultimate goal of playing in the NHL for eight decades. In today's landscape, the AHL is thriving. From a business standpoint, the league has never been more stable.\n\nAndrews began his AHL career as the general manager of the Cape Breton Oilers, the minor league affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers, in 1987. After seven seasons, he became president of the AHL.\n\nIn order for the league to survive, changes needed to be made, the most substantial being relocating affiliates to be closer to their NHL parent clubs. Under Andrews' leadership, league attendance has climbed, and more than 92 million fans have attended AHL games in the past 14 seasons, an average of 5,400 per game. In 2001, the AHL absorbed the International Hockey League to form one league and now the relationship between the NHL and AHL is solid.\n\n\"Then to create something that really established a one-to-one relationship with NHL teams and established the American Hockey League as the place where players developed before they get to the NHL was pretty important, not only from a branding point of view but from a business perspective,\" Andrews said. \"It gave all of our independent owners better footing to work with our NHL partners.\"\n\nThe AHL is the feeder pool and testing ground for the NHL, and even though the leagues are separate business entities, Andrews and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman have built a strong relationship. Having the league act as a testing ground for new rules for the NHL, such as 3-on-3 OT and the shootout, is part of the success as well.\n\n\"If you look at where we are today with 30 franchises and the markets that we're in, and the role that we play for the NHL, and the percentage of players in the NHL that have come through [the AHL], I'm very proud of it,\" Andrews said. \"We're in as good of a place as we have ever been as a league.\"\n\nThe Hershey Bears celebrate winning the Calder Cup in 1958. Bruce Bennett Studios/Getty Images\n\nCurrent Minnesota Wild coach Mike Yeo spent time developing his coaching skills in the AHL.\n\n\"It's a real tough league,\" said Yeo, who was an assistant for six seasons with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins and a head coach with Houston. \"There was a time we were playing in Hartford and we had five guys on our team with over 300 penalty minutes and they had something similar. Our five guys and their five guys were stretching at center ice facing each other and you could tell it was going to be a war that night. We didn't get through warmups before a brawl basically broke out. As a coach, I was up in the stands taking lines and what stood out most to me was all of our players are fighting, and we had our backup goalie taking shots on our starting goalie to try to warm him up.\"\n\nLearning how to become a professional on and off the ice in the AHL helped New Jersey Devils goaltender Cory Schneider's transition to the NHL. After being drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in 2004, he made his professional debut in 2007-08 with the Manitoba Moose.\n\n\"I didn't know much about it, coming out of Boston College,\" Schneider said. \"I signed my contract and was all excited and they said, 'OK, now you're going to Winnipeg.' I had to look at a map and figure out where it was and what it was all about. In retrospect, it was a really good experience for me. The three years felt like a long time at the time because you want to get to the next level, but once you've completed [time in AHL], you're a much better player for it.\"\n\nIt's definitely not an easy life, especially when you play three games in three nights every weekend.\n\n\"That third game on a Sunday afternoon might have been some of the worst hockey games you could see because everyone's beat up and tired,\" said Schneider, 29.\n\nGreg Smyth recorded 1,970 penalty minutes in 361 career AHL games. Bruce Bennett Studios/Getty Images\n\nIt doesn't matter if you coached, played, officiated or worked in the AHL, it's a rugged and not-so-glamorous lifestyle with a legendary impact.\n\n\"There's really something to be said for having to earn your way and having to fight, not literally fight, but battle night after night and going into tough buildings, ride the bus and play three games in three days,\" Yeo said. \"Whether as a coach or player, it gave you that reminder every day how lucky we are to be [in the NHL] and to never take it for granted.\"\n\nThornton believes every pro player should spend time in the minors to get a better appreciation for the game. He remembered how close everyone was on the team, how everyone lived in the same building, and most of the time had more than one roommate. He had a kegerator in his room and his door was always open.\n\nThe bus rides and late-night cheese steaks were the norm, opposed to charter flights and filet mignon.\n\n\"It didn't matter if you were a first-rounder or a ninth-rounder, you showed up, respected the old guys, respected the system, respected the coach and you did what you were told,\" Thornton said. \"After practice, the single guys, the married guys, everyone went to the same bar, had a few beers and played pool. Everyone was on the same page and it was awesome. It was a great time.\"\n\nThat's the life of an AHLer.", "Chuck Pagano could be in his final week as coach of the Colts": "INDIANAPOLIS -- The team's franchise quarterback will likely miss more than half the season. The offensive line continues to be mess. The defense has been inconsistent again. And they're still in the position to finish with a .500 record.\n\nIn many instances, those would be valid enough reasons for the head coach to keep his job. But this isn't a normal instance and this hasn't been a normal season for Chuck Pagano and the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nPagano could be coaching his final game with the Colts on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d Pagano said when asked if he's worried about this being his final week as coach of the team. \u201cI'm worried about the health of our football team. Just coming off of a great win. Preparation for the next one. That's all you can do.\u201d\n\nNobody, especially Pagano, thought he would be in the current situation. Not with the offseason moves the Colts made. Not with Andrew Luck at quarterback. But here the organization sits, on its way to missing the playoffs for the first time since 2011. Pagano's job status may not be in question had he accepted owner Jim Irsay's one-year contract extension during the offseason.\n\nIt looks like turning down the extension from Irsay could very much cost Pagano. He turned it down because he didn't like the small raise he was being offered and he felt like the Colts would be good enough this season that he would have the leverage when it came to contract talks. The opposite has happened, as Indianapolis will finish with its worst record under Pagano.\n\n\"You know what, my late father-in-law told me, \u2018Life's tough. That's just how it is. That's just how it is.' Tough times never last, tough people do,\" Pagano said. \"He loved that one too. What are you going to do?\u201d\n\nPagano said he has not spoken to Irsay about his future with the organization.\n\nWhat about any regrets not accepting the team's one-year extension?\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Pagano said.\n\nPagano went from knowing Luck would be his starting quarterback every game during the previous three seasons, to starting 40-year-old Matt Hasselbeck, to having journeyman Charlie Whitehurst taking snaps in Hasselbeck's place to possibly starting Stephen Morris, who the Colts signed off Philadelphia's practice squad last week, against the Titans. That's a tough situation for any coach in the NFL to deal with.\n\n\"Deeply, deeply in debt and very grateful that we had [Hasselbeck and Whitehurst],\" Pagano said. \"They're warriors. They're great teammates, they're great competitors. To answer your question, you're going to have problems [without Luck]. They're not going to be able to run the whole, you got a 40-year old quarterback and got a guy that just came into the building, there are going to be some limitations but you're going to play to everybody's strengths.\"\n\nEven if the Colts did have Luck and they made the playoffs, Pagano's relationship with general manager Ryan Grigson has remained poor all season and there's no belief that it'll be repaired anytime soon.\n\nPagano knows the odds of him returning as coach aren't good. He has talked like a person on his way out the door for weeks now. Pagano has stood behind the microphone after every game --win or lose -- and throughout the week answering questions about the team's performance and his job status while others have stayed in the background during their underachieving season.\n\n\u201cThere have been a lot of tests,\u201d Pagano said. \u201cThere's been obstacles, there's been adversity and that's just how it is. Whether you're coaching football or in life itself, you're going to have to deal with stuff. Again, I think we've learned a lot about ourselves, we've learned a lot about each other. Adversity doesn't build character, it reveals it. What was revealed to me is that we've got the right culture, we've got the right environment, we've got the right guys in that locker room. I'd go to war with these guys any day.\u201d", "Mike Pettine, Cleveland Browns coach, to discuss viral video with Johnny Manziel": "Cleveland Browns coach Mike Pettine says he will have a conversation with Johnny Manziel after another social media video of the quarterback surfaced Sunday night.\n\nEditor's Picks McManamon: Manziel takes full blame for loss Johnny Manziel put Sunday's loss squarely on his shoulders despite his coach praising his competitiveness and his overall effort, Pat McManamon writes.\n\nBrowns release Saunders, make Bryant inactive Browns practice squad safety De'Ante Saunders has been released and linebacker Armonty Bryant will not be active for Cleveland's season finale following their arrests Friday.\n\nMcManamon: Reasons to keep/fire Mike Pettine Decision time is approaching for Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, who must decide if he will retain or release Mike Pettine after a disastrous season, and Pat McManamon provides reasons for both scenarios. 2 Related\n\nThe video, which appeared on Busted Coverage, shows Manziel singing along to \"March Madness\" by Future in a private residence. A Tampa Bay Buccaneers jersey of Mike Evans, Manziel's Texas A&M teammate, hangs on the wall.\n\n\"Any time there's something with our players that casts them potentially in a bad light, whether it's Johnny or any of our other guys, it's certainly a concern,\" Pettine said Monday before he had seen the video. \"I'm sure I'll see it and have a discussion with him about it.\n\n\"These circumstances are different from the incident that occurred before. I'm just not going to go into a ton of detail with it until I get a little bit more information about it, but it's something that I'm sure privately we'll discuss if it needs to be discussed.\"\n\nPettine is expected to talk to media again on Wednesday.\n\nIn November, a similar video appeared of Manziel partying and singing the same song in Austin, Texas, during the Browns' bye week. Manziel lost the starting quarterback job when that video appeared and when he lied to the coaches about when it was filmed.\n\nManziel spent 10 weeks in rehab after his January check-in. How alcohol figures into his post-rehab treatment program is not known, nor is the specific reason Manziel went for treatment.\n\nPettine was asked Monday where the team is with Manziel being public about drinking.\n\n\"It falls back into not micromanaging personal lives,\" Pettine said. \"It's very public, unfortunately. The thing that's disappointing is how public it becomes. And it's something that, with all of our players, we're going to sit down with them before they get out of here and talk about where they are personally, where they are professionally. And certainly Johnny will be no exception.\"\n\nMike Pettine says he wants more information about a new social media video of Johnny Manziel, but the Browns coach plans to discuss it with the quarterback. Jason Miller/Getty Images\n\nPettine would not comment on the possibility this video could lead to another demotion for Manziel, but his tenor did not indicate it was likely.\n\n\"I don't have all the information on it, and I'm just not going to comment on it at this time,\" Pettine said. \"I don't have all the facts with it.\"\n\nIn discussing Manziel's on-field play and practice work, Pettine stressed that Manziel has been professional with the team.", "2015 fantasy football consistency ratings entering Week 17": "Last updated: Dec. 29, 2015 (through Week 16)\n\nHow Consistency Ratings Work\n\nUsing fantasy points determined by ESPN's standard scoring, the charts contained in this column rate players based upon how consistently reliable they have been during the 2015 season. For IDPs (individual defensive players), the following scoring is used: solo tackle (1), assisted tackle (0.5), sack (3), interception (3), forced fumble (3), fumble recovery (3), touchdown (6), safety (2), pass defended (1). To familiarize you with some of the terminology and column headers listed in the charts below:\n\nStart%: The player's \"Start Percentage,\" which shows how often he earned your start in an ESPN standard league. This is his number of \"Starts\" -- those defined below -- divided by his number of scheduled team games.\n\nCR: The player's \"Consistency Rating,\" which is calculated as his weekly standard deviation divided by his fantasy points per game average. This is meant to identify the players who were most consistently close to their weekly averages. The lower the number, the more consistent the player. Again, lower numbers are better.\n\nPPR%: The player's Start Percentage using PPR scoring, which uses ESPN's standard scoring settings but adds one point per reception.\n\nFPTS/G: The player's average fantasy points scored per game.\n\nStart: The number of times that the player's point total in a given week was worthy of having had him active in an ESPN standard league.\n\nStud: The number of times the player's point total ranked among the top at his position.\n\nStiff: The number of times the player's point total ranked among the worst at his position, making almost any waiver-wire option a smarter choice.\n\nThese are the benchmarks for what constitutes a \"Start,\" \"Stud\" or \"Stiff\" performance:\n\nConsistency Ratings Benchmarks QB RB WR TE K D/ST DL LB DB Start Top 10 Top 25 Top 25 Top 10 Top 10 Top 10 Top 20 Top 20 Top 20 Stud Top 2 Top 5 Top 5 Top 2 Top 2 Top 2 Top 4 Top 4 Top 4 Stiff 21st+ 51st+ 51st+ 21st+ 21st+ 21st+ 41st+ 41st+ 41st+\n\nSat: The number of times the player missed a game. Players are not charged \"Stiff\" points for sitting out, nor does it impact their overall Consistency Rating (CR), but it hurts their overall Start Percentage (Start%).\n\nPlayers must have at least a 20.0 percent Start Percentage (\"Start%\") in either standard scoring or PPR leagues for inclusion in the chart. All defense/special teams are included, regardless of whether they met those minimums.\n\nFor Consistency Ratings from 2013-15 combined, click here.\n\nQuick click by position:", "Uni Watch contest results -- How you'd make over the Toronto Maple Leafs": "If something ain't broke, how do you fix it?\n\nThat was the challenge facing Uni Watch readers in our latest design contest. With the Toronto Maple Leafs reportedly set to mark the franchise's centennial by unveiling a new uniform for the 2016-17 season, we wanted to beat them to the punch and see how you folks would redesign the team. But as many of you pointed out, the Leafs already have one of the NHL's better-looking uniform sets, and tinkering with the design of an Original Six team is always a risky enterprise, making this a very tricky assignment.\n\nWhat follows are the most interesting solutions we received. As you'll see, many of them acknowledged the Leafs' heritage by including throwback uniforms based on the old Toronto Arenas and Toronto St. Patricks, which were the first two incarnations of the Leafs franchise. In all cases, you can click on the images to see larger versions.\n\nReady? Here we go:\n\n1. Best \"less is more\" design: Ross Taylor\n\nSometimes the best solution is the simplest one. While everyone else played around with various typographic treatments and jersey formats, Ross Taylor did something ingeniously simple: He removed the lettering from the chest logo. It's so obvious once you see it, right? After a century of play, the Leafs don't need to spell out their name -- the plain, iconic leaf on the jersey says everything that needs to be said and feels simultaneously classic and contemporary. Taylor's centennial patch is a winner too. Great job all around.\n\n2. Best modern design: Jim Brewster\n\nIt's not the right look for this tradition-minded franchise, but Jim Brewster's stylized maple leaf is a cleverly minimalist take on what the Leafs could look like in an alternate universe (or uni-verse). His Toronto Arenas throwback provides a nice historical counterbalance to the forward-looking feel of the home and road sets. Nicely done.\n\n3. Best design that would provoke a riot: Casey Tebo\n\nMuch like Jim Brewster (see above), Casey Tebo has come up with a design that isn't a good fit for the Leafs but is nonetheless an intriguing look that stretches the boundaries of what a hockey uniform can look like. Bonus points for the symbol on the side of the pants, which is based on the Toronto municipal flag.\n\n4. Best bang for the buck: Alan Su\n\nAlan Su got surprisingly good mileage from a series of small tweaks to the Leafs' current design, the most impressive of which is the removal of the stem from the leaf logo. This small move somehow makes the logo seem more modern and makes the whole uni set feel more dynamic. Who knew such a tiny adjustment could have such a big visual impact?\n\n5. Best failed design: Peter Reusch\n\nGood ideas can sometimes be found lurking within bad ones. At first glance, Peter Reusch's uni set is way too busy. But if you eliminate the typography below the chest logo and scrap the overdesigned anniversary patch (a leaf within a leaf within a leaf!), the core design of a partial maple leaf framing the Toronto skyline is really nice. Imagine that logo on a jersey all by itself, without all the other gewgaws. Not bad!\n\n6. Best presentation: Eric Poole\n\nI'll be honest: Eric Poole's uni set doesn't do a lot for me. But it looks a lot better, or at least a lot more fun, when mocked up on the Maple Leafs' longtime mascot, Carlton the Bear. And while ferocious mascots are pretty much a clich\u00e9 at this point, Poole gets bonus points for transforming Carlton from a cuddly but boring bear into a hilariously over-the-top marauder. The lesson: Presentation counts, kids.\n\nHonorable mention\n\nMany entrants incorporated Toronto's CN Tower into their logo designs. The most successful of these came from Adam Mergens, who managed to work his leaf/tower hybrid logo onto the pants, as well as on the jersey. ... Longtime Uni Watch reader Tom Bierbaum always comes up with beautifully hand-drawn entries for our design contests. He usually goes the extra mile by coming up with new uniforms for multiple teams at once, and this time was no exception. He redesigned the Bruins, Flames and Devils, in addition to the Maple Leafs and provided a great logo sheet to boot. ... Most fans would probably be satisfied if the Leafs went with Ben Peters' design. Solid work. ... Brett Thomas came up with a good centennial patch, incorporating maple leaves into the numerals. ... More good centennial patches: Nolan O'Brien went with a crossed-flags approach, and Charles Noerenberg scored with a more contemporary treatment. ... Chris Giorgio came up with a very nice retro-themed design package and upped the ante with his road uniform, which is a real stripe-o-rama.\n\nWant to see more?

I know I did, but here they are just four points behind the Nashville Predators for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference after a 6-3 win over the San Jose Sharks moved Colorado to 9-3-1 in December. I mean, did anyone really see this coming? MacKinnon had the hat trick Monday night as the Avs went 4-for-6 on the power play, an area of improvement this season. The Avs are 10th in the league on the PP after placing a dismal 29th a year ago. Meanwhile, MacKinnon leads the team in scoring with 33 points, and is on pace for 73 on the season after slumping to just 38 points in 64 games last season as a second-year player. His 13 goals also have him on pace for 29 on the season, which would eclipse his career high of 24, set two years ago as a rookie. What do you think, guys? Can MacKinnon and the Avs stay in the race?\n\n@ESPN_Burnside: My hand is up, Pierre, still raised but with maybe a little bend in it now. Last night is a good example of what lies ahead for the Avs as they try to stay in the hunt. As they were thumping San Jose on the road (seems everyone beats San Jose in the Shark Tank), Nashville was whipping a slumping New York Rangers team 5-3, and the Minnesota Wild clipped the Detroit Red Wings, 3-1. Ah, life in the Central Division. For the Avs to make it to the postseason, they'll likely have to dislodge one of Nashville, Chicago or Minnesota (figuring the St. Louis Blues, with a 10-point cushion on Colorado, and the runaway West leaders the Dallas Stars, are safe). Which of those three teams is most vulnerable? Perhaps Nashville, perhaps although they've started to turn up the offense of late. Chicago? Barring injury, no way. Minnesota? If Devan Dubnyk stays healthy -- he was a surprise starter Monday and got the win -- no way. In short, it's been an inspired run by the Avs -- who got the win in the second of back-to-back outings, with backup Calvin Pickard in net -- but I don't see it ending up with a trip to the playoffs.\n\n@CraigCustance: The Avs are definitely improved over last season, but I'm with Scott. The degree of difficulty for them to make the playoffs in the Central after a slow start is too high to allow us to make any bold proclamations regarding the Avalanche. That said, I believe the Predators can be caught. Nashville earned a nice win over the Rangers, but there's a lot of season left for the Avs to make up four points on the Preds. The interesting thing to me will be what kind of backlash comes from Colorado coach Patrick Roy and the rest of the team if they finish with more points than the second- or third-place team in the Pacific Division and still miss the playoffs. That's the situation as it stands right now. Colorado would have a legitimate gripe, and it might be the kind of scenario that would force the league to take a hard look at the current playoff format.\n\n@ESPNJoeyMac: Talk about snapping a goal drought with authority. That's exactly what MacKinnon's second career hat trick did. Maybe now the goals will start to come in bunches for MacKinnon and he can help keep Colorado on the upswing. But you have to keep the puck out of the net first and foremost, and that will be a challenge for the Avalanche with Reto Berra sidelined with an ankle injury. Pickard, who was called up from the AHL, made 35 saves in his first NHL start of the season for Colorado. As a hockey fan, I would love to see the Avalanche earn a postseason berth so Jarome Iginla can play in the Stanley Cup playoffs again, but I don't see it happening for Colorado in such a tough division.\n\nAround the league", "Track and field -- IAAF's decision unprecedented, but next step seems predictable": "ESPN Olympics reporter Bonnie Ford discusses what Russia will need to do to participate in track and field during the Rio games in 2016. (1:56)\n\nThey did what was expected. It was the least they could do, aside from nothing at all.\n\nFriday evening, council members of track and field's international governing body made a gesture that resembled governing by suspending Russia from competition. The action is provisional and time-indefinite and unprecedented. Whether it will amount to anything more than bureaucratic theater will be revealed soon enough.\n\nRussia deliberately and systematically undermined the global anti-doping rules that form the gossamer-thin barricade between functional competition and performance-enhanced anarchy.\n\nIts athletes and their enablers are hardly the only scofflaws in the greater race to top the medal table at the Olympic Games, a platform for pure ambition that also serves as a proxy for less admirable geopolitical rivalries. And it strains credulity to think that track and field is the lone diseased limb on Russia's sports body politic. But for now, Russia's sports establishment, with regard to track and field, is the only fiefdom to have been completely exposed -- in hundreds of pages of compelling evidence amassed by the World Anti-Doping Agency's Independent Commission -- as a willful, top-to-bottom fraud.\n\nEditor's Picks IAAF hands down ban to Russian track program The decision by the IAAF's ruling council will keep Russian track and field athletes out of international competition for an indefinite period, possibly including next year's Olympics in Brazil.\n\nWADA committee: Russian agency non-compliant A World Anti-Doping Agency committee found Russia's anti-doping operation non-compliant with its code Friday.\n\nWADA report: Russian government knew of doping Russian track and field athletes could be banned from next year's Olympics after a devastatingly critical report accused the country's government of complicity in widespread doping and cover-ups. 2 Related\n\nCan anyone believe that a bunker that took so long to build could be dismantled in a matter of months? That a system so efficient at lowering the blackout shades will suddenly let the sunshine in? That the IAAF -- an entity whose immediate past president is under criminal investigation, whose current president once referred to his predecessor as a \"spiritual leader,\" whose attitude toward every allegation until this last crisis erupted has been reactive and defensive in the extreme -- can be an instrument of reform?\n\nFor those who remain sanguine, here's something to keep in mind. A little less than two years ago, Russia hosted the Winter Olympic Games. As always, WADA sent a team of independent observers to monitor the anti-doping operation, which at the Games is overseen by the International Olympic Committee, with much of the laboratory and collection staff provided by the host country.\n\nThis is how the WADA observation team (IO) concluded the executive summary in its Sochi report:\n\n\"The IO was granted full cooperation by the IOC at the Sochi Games. Collectively, the IO members had participated in over twenty past IO missions and none had ever experienced such a collaborative approach between the IO and the IOC. Overall, the IO was of the view that the Sochi Games were a milestone in the evolution of the Olympic Games anti-doping program and that the initiatives observed will, if further progressed, have a positive and long lasting impact for clean athletes in the future.\"\n\nIt didn't matter how well-intentioned and qualified those observers were. They were up against an impenetrable and implacable vertical system. All that singing around the campfire didn't stop the Russians from setting up a secret dummy lab in Moscow to pre-screen samples. It didn't stop undercover Russian agents from intimidating lab employees. Later on, it didn't stop the Moscow lab director from destroying 1,400 samples after the WADA commission explicitly asked to have them preserved. We have no idea how many athletes in other sports would have been implicated if those samples had been safely stored. That act of sabotage came a mere 10 months after a big white animatronic bear cried synthetic tears at the Closing Ceremony as it bid the world farewell before the torch was extinguished.\n\nTurns out Sochi may have been a testing milestone, just not the one anybody imagined: A $51 billion showcase for Russia to test how much it could game the system.\n\nBy what criteria will a new Russian order be measured, and who can accurately measure it if Russia was able to pull off its smoke and mirrors act under the noses of the IOC and WADA in Sochi?\n\nRussia's anti-doping agency is an oxymoron, on the way to being declared as such by WADA, which also yanked the Moscow laboratory's accreditation. In about a month, Russian sports officials and politicians will get a hearing before the IAAF, which will then set further terms for the suspension and eventual reinstatement.\n\nIt's hard not to see this process scrolling forward in a predictable way. Harsh words will be spoken. Policy paperwork will pile up like snowdrifts. Magical thinking will be applied to corroded science and cheating. There will be much discussion of the idea that WADA should take over global drug testing, with no immediate way to compel countries to invest in what would be a logistically gigantic and costly operation. Not to mention the question of who would be competent or free enough of conflicts of interest to run it.\n\nMy guess is that Russia will be off the track for six months. During that stretch, the country will forfeit its plan to host the world race-walking championships, a grimly humorous coincidence, since Russia winked when its own banned athletes in that discipline continued to compete. Russian athletes will not be able to enter major marathons, which seems fitting, since one of its runners, Liliya Shobukhova, doped her way to multiple victories in Chicago and paid to have positive tests buried. The world junior track championships, scheduled for July in Kazan, will be relocated.\n\nThose penalties are small potatoes as opposed to real meat.\n\nThe one measure that could begin to re-establish credibility for Russia and the IAAF alike is a sanction with muscle, a sanction that dips into wallets and causes psychic pain. And that would be a suspension that keeps the Russian track and field team out of the Rio 2016 Summer Games. Whatever percentage of athletes who compete clean will be collateral damage, and that would be an unfortunate necessity.\n\nOr, WADA and the IOC could decide their 15-year-old anti-doping infrastructure is unworkable, and start suspending athletes with doping violations for a few games or at most a season, like U.S. professional leagues do. That's an unlikely concession for inhabitants of a sporting planet who have always wanted to portray themselves as a little higher in the firmament.\n\nThis is a tipping point moment, not just for Russia or the IAAF or WADA or the IOC. It's a tipping point for an increasingly dysfunctional Olympic model that is already creaking under the skewed economics faced by host cities. It's a tipping point for the relevance of Olympic sport as considered by an ever-more-distracted and justifiably skeptical audience. What happens now will be a clear road signal to other nations and athletes who are weighing the risk-reward ratio of cheating.", "2 European Ironmans To Split Professional Fields In 2016": "2 European Ironmans To Split Professional Fields In 2016 By Liz Hichens\n\nPublished Dec 16, 2015\n\nAthletes at 2015 Ironman Copenhagen.

It will be the sporting highlight of Scandinavia next summer and we look forward to welcoming the female professional athletes on August 20,\u201d added Christian Kirchberger, Managing Director of Ironman Sweden.\n\nRELATED: Ironman To Test Splitting Male And Female Pro Fields In 2016\n\nFILED UNDER: Ironman / News / Race Coverage TAGS: Ironman Copenhagen / Ironman Sweden / pro news", "NHL -- Arizona Coyotes rookie Max Domi finding his way around": "Anthony Duclair and Max Domi interview each other about their best- and worst-dressed teammates, what they do on off-days and who's to blame for the ketchup. (3:58)\n\nGLENDALE, Ariz. -- Max Domi's face has a pulpy quality. A little overripe eggplant, a little beat-up tomato look. The Arizona Coyotes rookie insisted that there are only five or six stitches, mostly along the right side of his nostril, and the rest is medical glue holding various flaps of skin together above his blackened right eye.\n\nStill, it's not a pretty sight.\n\nFirst there was the face-plant into a Minnesota Wild defender while he was traveling at breakneck speed on what Domi acknowledged might have been the most unnecessary play of all time.\n\n\"I've never skated as fast,\" Domi said with a laugh.\n\nThen there was a high stick to the face on the next shift and a puck in the face in front of the Wild's net during an Arizona power play -- a place Domi joked he's not used to going -- and then a second puck in the face at practice on this Wednesday morning.\n\n\"I'm not the most handsome guy to begin with, so this isn't helping,\" said Domi as we head from Glendale to his home near Scottsdale across the valley. \"It adds character. The guys got a good laugh out of it.\"\n\nMax Domi earned a souvenir that will help him remember his rookie season. Norm Hall/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nWhen captain Shane Doan finds out we're going to spend some time with the Coyotes' top rookie, he rolls his eyes in mock horror.\n\n\"You're going to ride with Max?\" Doan asked, shaking his head.\n\nActually, Domi is on his best driving behavior, following all the posted rules of the road. He doesn't get agitated even when the motorcycle in front of us in the high-occupancy lane settles in at about 50 miles an hour.\n\nDomi apologized for being late from post-practice lunch, but this is his routine.\n\nHe's a rink rat, always among the last to leave the rink, hanging out with the training staff, taking advantage of the hot/ice tubs, eating lunch.\n\n\"I was in a hurry today and I was still one of the last guys,\" he said.\n\nWhat has always been a passion and continues to be so now is also very much a job, and Domi, 30-plus games into his first NHL season, is soaking up every moment, moments he was seemingly born to embrace.\n\nDomi's father, Tie Domi, the longtime NHL tough guy and most recently a best-selling author having written a memoir of his times as an NHLer, had the day before departed the Domi domicile, a house in a gated community that used to belong to former Coyote Peter Mueller.\n\n\"So I'm not sure how messy the house is going to be,\" Domi said.\n\nIt's not at all, although Domi frets about a foreign smell. \"It must be something in the fridge,\" he said. His place is warm and comfortable.\n\nFather and son speak almost every day.\n\n\"He's the worst with the phone,\" Domi said with a laugh.\n\nIt's kind of an ongoing joke that Dad will call or text incessantly until family members respond. Often there is a text before games that includes nuggets of wisdom, bullet-point suggestions on how to have a good game.\n\nKeep your head up.\n\nMake smart plays.\n\nJust little reminders, the kind that Tie has provided to his son from the get-go.\n\nNone of that has changed since Max started his first NHL season in September.\n\n\"It's the exact same,\" he said of the relationship with his father. \"He's the same, hasn't changed one bit and neither have I.\"\n\nTie regularly visits Arizona and always stays with his son, although he has kept a low profile around the team. Max's mother, Leanne, is also a regular visitor and has been to visit recently as well; Max's house has a festive look and feel thanks to her. There's a nice wreath on the door. A series of stockings hangs on one tall bookcase. There's a holiday greeting strung over the fireplace and festive pillows on the couch. And there's a tree the two decorated together.\n\nIf there is food in the fridge that requires cooking, it is there because of Max's mother.\n\nMax admitted that he has not yet cooked a proper meal in the house.\n\nBreakfast, yes. But that doesn't really count as cooking, does it?\n\nInstead Domi and close pal, neighbor and fellow rookie Anthony Duclair are most often out for dinner in the neighborhood.\n\nMax Domi and Anthony Duclair have been practically inseparable this season. Jonathan Kozub/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nThey play on the same line and their instant karma is a key component of a surprising first third of the season for the Coyotes.\n\nDomi is second among NHL rookie point producers, with 25 points, behind the Chicago Blackhawks' Artemi Panarin, who has 31 points. Duclair is fourth, with 19 points.\n\nDomi and Duclair shop together, hang out, play games, drive around, share rides to and from the rink. They even share the same barber/hair stylist.\n\n\"We actually do,\" Duclair admitted. \"He's actually a big Coyotes fan, so that's pretty cool.\"\n\nWhen Duclair was first traded from the New York Rangers to Arizona at the trade deadline last season, among the first people he contacted was Domi.\n\n\"I guess we like the same things,\" Duclair said. \"We have a lot of similarities and things like that off the ice. On off-days, we like to do the same thing. We joke around, we chirp each other. We like to bug each other but at the same time it's all good and fun.\"\n\nThe two are sharing time and experiences both good and bad, and that commune has been more than a little helpful in making the transition to the NHL.\n\nDomi believes strongly that their bond away from the rink has been a key to success on the ice.\n\n\"I think the coolest thing is how close we are,\" Domi said. \"We're best buddies off the ice. It definitely translates. We push each other. We know what we're both capable of doing. He's a pretty special guy.\"\n\nOne of the big differences between junior hockey and the NHL is the schedule, not necessarily the travel part -- which is highly organized -- but the time spent at home, away from the rink.\n\nIn junior, Domi would practice with the London Knights late in the day and then that would bleed into dinner and the evening. In the NHL, there are longer stretches of time during the day, when most players are heading home to be with their families, when a young player might feel isolated or at loose ends if he didn't have a good pal like Duclair to help fill the void.\n\n\"It's not lonely, but it's different,\" Domi said.\n\nAt one point, Duclair was planning to live with Domi, but Duclair is allergic to dogs and Max has a special roommate who took precedence.\n\nOrion, Domi's service dog trained to help him deal with diabetes -- a disease he has dealt with since childhood -- emerges from his crate with great bounds of energy when Domi arrives home. The 20-year-old plays with Orion, giving him quiet instructions as the two prepare for their daily walk. If Orion isn't put to work, which means being with Domi in public, where he can monitor Domi's blood sugar levels through his canine sense of smell and taste, he gets a bit owly.\n\nGrowing up in the game has given Domi a bird's-eye view on how the greats handle attention, how they make time for people, how they understand the gift they possess and how they can make a meaningful impact on other people's lives, and he has tried to take that to heart.\n\n\"It's definitely something that's changed me and how I interact with people,\" Domi said.\n\nIt's one of the reasons he's active in supporting diabetes research, bringing attention to the disease and giving encouragement to young people who have the disease.\n\nNot long ago friends of former Coyotes GM Mike Barnett told Barnett of their son's diagnosis with diabetes at age 21 after the young man was hospitalized. It was a scary time for the family, and when Domi learned of the family's situation through Barnett and the Coyotes, he happily met with the family when the Coyotes were in Los Angeles. The two are now in regular communication.\n\nIt is a rare road trip that doesn't bring with it multiple requests of the team to have Domi meet with youngsters with diabetes. While at home, Domi hosts a group of diabetic youngsters at a practice, meeting with them to talk after the team finishes its skate.\n\nDomi has never known a life that wasn't a hockey life.\n\nBorn in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where Tie played parts of three seasons, Max spent most of his formative years in the Toronto area when his father was a mainstay with Pat Quinn's Toronto Maple Leafs until the elder Domi left the NHL after the 2005-06 season.\n\nMax has never known a life where he couldn't walk into a room and chat with Mario Lemieux, another of his father's close friends, or speak to Mats Sundin as he would a favorite uncle.\n\nTie Domi is frequently alongside Max Domi, including at the 2013 draft. Dave Sandford/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nSundin and Max still keep in touch, Sundin sending texts after games, while Domi inquires about the big Swede's family and his life post-hockey.\n\nMark Messier, with whom his father played in New York, is another close family friend.\n\n\"It's pretty ridiculous, when you think about it now,\" Domi admitted.\n\nDomi recalls a special Messier moment before he started his junior career. Playing on a top Toronto youth team in the playoffs, Domi was struggling against a specific opponent in the faceoff circle.\n\nTie offered advice, but none of it seemed to work.\n\nFinally, as the two were headed out the door one day, his father got off the phone and told Max to go back in the house and get a couple of sticks and pucks. Gear in hand, they went to a Toronto hotel, where Messier was staying while shooting a commercial. After some pleasantries, Messier got up in the hotel restaurant and told Max he would teach him some of the finer points of the faceoff, and so the two did a little drill right in the restaurant.\n\n\"I was 15 years old and here we were in the middle of the restaurant at the hotel,\" Domi said. \"I don't think I lost a draw the rest of the year,\" he added with a laugh.\n\nSome veteran players who played with or against Tie take time to chat with Max as he's making his way around the NHL in his first season.\n\nOne night against the St. Louis Blues, Domi found himself lining up for a faceoff against Alex Steen. Steen's father, Thomas, was a former Winnipeg favorite and teammate of Tie's. Max recalls hanging out with the younger Steen when Steen was first drafted by Toronto, and at one point Alex played on a line with Tie.\n\n\"Alex, he was always so good to me,\" Domi said.\n\nOn this night, then, as the two prepared to do battle in the circle, Steen simply looked at Max and started laughing.\n\n\"This is hilarious,\" Steen told Domi.\n\nThen he told Max that his skates were untied.\n\nAnd Domi looked.\n\n\"But I still managed to beat him on the draw,\" Domi said with a rueful shake of his head, even though Steen needled him throughout the night about having fallen for the old \"skates are untied\" gambit.\n\nIt hasn't been all roses, of course, this inaugural trip through an NHL season.\n\nHead coach Dave Tippett has talked about the learning curve for his talented rookies, and while the creativity has been a welcome tonic to the rebuilding Coyotes, there are still plenty of mistakes to factor into the equation.\n\nMax Domi met with Isaac Jensen and his diabetes-alert dog, Oshie, after a recent event. Arizona Coyotes\n\nThere's no denying that, Domi said.\n\nHe recalled thinking before the game one night in Detroit: Do not overcommit on Niklas Kronwall at the point. But there was Domi, barreling in on the veteran Red Wings defender at the blue line only to find Kronwall deftly sneaking by him and making a pass that led to a goal.\n\n\"You learn the hard way and then you don't do it again,\" Domi said. \"As a hockey player, you know when you've messed up. I've definitely had my share of mistakes this year.\"\n\nOr you try not to repeat those errors. That is part of the learning curve too, not just recognizing the mistakes but learning not to put yourself in the position to repeat them.\n\nWhatever ups and downs there have been on the ice, Domi and the rest of a youthful Coyotes squad that includes Duclair, Jordan Martinook, Tobias Rieder and Klas Dahlbeck have had a positive impact on the rest of the team. And that's not necessarily a given, noted captain Doan.\n\n\"Young guys coming in sometimes have a feeling of entitlement,\" Doan said. But with Domi leading the pack, there has been no such awkwardness or dressing room tension.\n\n\"There's a lot of recognition that comes with somebody that's had as much success as he's had on the ice already, and there is not one ounce of that,\" Doan said. \"And every single vet in the room is as big a fan of him as anybody. It's just human nature in sports when the new guy comes in to feel a little bit, I don't know, you want them to earn it, I don't know how to express it other than there can sometimes be resentment from the veteran guys.\n\n\"It has made our room so much fun ... They've just been so eager to learn and at the same time they're driving the bus for us, so they've had the right to feel some entitlement. It's pretty awesome.\"\n\nDomi has become an instant fan favorite in Arizona, although he acknowledged that it's a different kind of attention than his father and entire family endured and/or celebrated in Toronto as he was growing into a top-end hockey player himself.\n\nMax Domi stopped by an area school to help it kick off its diabetes charity walk. Arizona Coyotes\n\nDomi recalled when his parents split up, a separation that, given the hockey-mad culture in Canada, became a news event that saw the family's personal relationships played out in full view of the public.\n\n\"I'd be lying if I said it wasn't tough,\" Domi said. \"That was a pretty tough little spell of weird stuff going on. It was crazy. It was everywhere. It was the talk of the town.\"\n\nHis parents are both in serious relationships and remain close, Domi said. And the period of time helped galvanize a strong relationship with his two sisters, one attending the University of Western Ontario in London, where Domi played his junior hockey, and the other a senior in high school in Toronto.\n\n\"We really leaned on each other,\" he said.\n\nIs he the doting brother scaring off prospective suitors?\n\nNot really. If potential dates have hurdles to face, it will be from Tie, not Max.\n\nIn fact, Domi's sisters might be more protective of their hockey-playing brother than the other way around.\n\nDomi takes little for granted.\n\nHe understands the learning curve is just starting and the final 50 or so games will be a real test of his own worthiness and the worthiness of the surprising Coyotes.\n\n\"Every day, you learn something new about playing in the NHL,\" he said. \"It'll be interesting to see how we all do.\"", "Will Kobe\u2019s real goodbye be in Rio?": "The assumed end for Kobe Bryant will come on a Wednesday night in April at Staples Center. April 13, to be exact, when the Utah Jazz visit Kobe\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers for the final regular-season game of Kobe\u2019s 20th (and farewell) season.\n\nOur advice?\n\nDon\u2019t assume.\n\nIt is more than conceivable that our last dose of Kobe hooping at the highest level could actually come in August, with those goodbye waves and thankful blown kisses to the crowd dispatched from atop a medal stand.\n\nIn Brazil.\n\nThe sheer math of it will undoubtedly make the mere suggestion sound outlandish to some. Give a roster spot to the battered Bryant for the Rio Olympics? With such a deep pool of players to pick from?\n\nJust trust me: No. 24 will draw serious consideration from USA Basketball elders Jerry Colangelo and Mike Krzyzewski -- two of the biggest Kobe fans on Planet Roundball -- if Bryant makes it to the summer in reasonably good health and makes himself available to be chosen.\n\nEditor's note Remember our encylopedia-length Weekend Dimes back in the day? On Fridays, whenever the schedule allows, we're going to try to recapture the spirit of the WD thing with a mini Son of Dime ... because you know what nostalgic saps we are here at SLL.\n\nAfter Colangelo and Coach K's decade together in charge of the national team, it is well understood within the USAB inner sanctum that assembling a squad for the Olympics does not mean simply picking the 12 most talented players. Not for the competition that, unlike the FIBA World Cup, typically attracts every top American name in the game.\n\nNot when the coach has only 40 minutes per game to dole out.\n\nThe 11th and 12th men, and maybe even the 10th man, can reasonably expect to do much more watching than playing. Which helps explain why USAB, in similar circumstances, brought Jason Kidd to the Beijing Games in 2008 at age 35.\n\nKidd averaged 1.6 points and 2.0 assists per game for that Olympic team. He wasn\u2019t there because his country needed him on the floor. He was there because Krzyzewski loved the leadership/presence/mentoring he could offer to the rest of the team as a virtual coach in uniform.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the same sort of role USAB would offer Bryant, at 37, if that's what makes sense for both sides at season\u2019s end.\n\nColangelo, Krzyzewski and USAB executive Sean Ford have made it clear that they intend to use the whole NBA season to evaluate all of their options, since they're arguably staring at the hardest cut-down to 12 in the history of the program.\n\nLeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Paul George, Blake Griffin, Chris Paul, Carmelo Anthony, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, DeMarcus Cousins, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kevin Love, John Wall, Jimmy Butler and Dwight Howard ... there\u2019s a quick 20 names off the top of our heads to throw at you just to get the dissection and debate started. There are so many different ways USAB can go, while also allowing for the usual disclaimers that injuries and contractual conundrums that arise between now and the end of June will inevitably make some of the decisions for them.\n\nIn general, though, USAB officials like to see an old head (a la Kidd in 2008) or a fresh-faced future star (like The Brow suiting up at the 2012 Olympics before he had ever spent a minute in the NBA) on the end of the bench. It's proven to be a wiser approach than stuffing the roster with a dozen dudes who merit major minutes, which would only set Krzyzewski up to find two or three of them seething about sitting.\n\nWhat the USAB folks won't (and obviously can\u2019t) say, meanwhile, is that the threat of losing in Rio isn't nearly what it was in Beijing or London. As we've lamented in this space more than once since the 2014 FIBA World Cup, we've actually hit a bumpy patch worldwide where the gap between Team USA and the rest of the world is regrettably widening when it should be shrinking. Once-mighty Spain is aging and no other country in circulation has been able to establish itself as a foe that can legitimately steal a gold-medal game from the Yanks.\n\nWhich is to say that there is absolutely zero basketball risk in giving Kobe a seat on the plane to Brazil at the expense of a player who presumably has more to contribute numbers-wise.\n\nWe repeat: Consider this a Stein Line Live-engraved guarantee that the United States, no matter who else it sees in the 12-team tournament next Aug. 5-21, will be collecting another round of gold medals on Aug. 21, 2016.\n\nSo why not let Bryant, two days before his 38th birthday, go out in glory?\n\nWill Kobe finish his basketball career with a gold medal around his neck? Bob Donnan/USA TODAY Sports\n\nMaybe he won't be healthy enough to play top-level basketball in July (when USAB convenes for training camp) and August. Maybe he won\u2019t have the requisite emotional fuel to even put his name forward for Olympic consideration. Maybe Bryant will ultimately decide, after becoming the first player in league history to spend 20 seasons with the same team, that he wants our last meaningful glimpse of him to be in Lakers colors.\n\nYet you can rest assured that bringing Bryant to Brazil isn't going to hurt the team one whit. It\u2019s likewise a safe assumption that playing with all those American stars, as well as that shorter 3-point line, would help Kobe look a lot better than he has in this opening quarter of his swan song in Lakerland, where he's been plagued by a lack of explosion to create openings for shots on top of his own stubbornness ... but also the sort of proven talent around him to make the game a little easier.\n\nI know, I know. I hear the Kobe Haters in the audience shouting: How many farewell tours does this guy need? The Lakers have 64 games left on their schedule. There\u2019s every chance Bryant will be voted in to start in the All-Star Game in Toronto on Feb. 14. Do we really have to send him to the Olympics, too?\n\nNo.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to.\n\nIt has to be right for everyone involved.\n\nYet if you\u2019ve had the privilege to follow Team USA around with Ambassador Kobe decked out in red, white and blue, and thus seeing how much he means to basketball fans abroad with his top-10-ish of all-time resume and his flawless Italian and Spanish, you can\u2019t help but be intrigued by the idea.\n\nEspecially when you\u2019re an unapologetically sappy basketball romantic like moi.\n\nEastern Conference\n\nThe Pacers, amid their stunning 12-5 start, have made swingman Solomon Hill available via trade, according to league sources. A first-round draftee as recently as 2013, Hill is out there after falling out of favor in Indiana despite playing in all 82 games last season and averaging 29.0 minutes in 2014-15 for the old, plodding Pacers. ... Tough news in Boston: Brad Stevens says Marcus Smart's injury absence will be longer than anticipated, potentially stretching into the new year. According to one trusted scout, Smart\u2019s hounding perimeter D makes him \u201cthe new Tony Allen -- he simply refuses to be screened.\u201d ... With the recent release of Martell Webster to open up a roster spot for Ryan Hollins, Washington is now paying $5,623,500 to players this season who aren\u2019t on the roster. That equates to 6.8 percent of the Wizards\u2019 current $82.2 million payroll, which puts them at No. 3 in the league\u2019s Dead Money Standings, narrowly ahead of Brooklyn. Detroit is at No. 2, with $9.4 million -- or 12.2 percent of its $76.7 million payroll -- going to five waived players, most notably Josh Smith ($5.4 million) and Danny Granger ($2.2 million). No team, of course, can compare to the 76ers, who are paying $25.9 million this season -- or 43.2 percent of Philly\u2019s $59.9 million outlay overall -- to eight players who were let go before the season started. JaVale McGee and Gerald Wallace, acquired by the Sixers in deals that cleared cap space for other teams and released soon thereafter, soak up $22 million of that total.\n\nWestern Conference\n\nYour obligatory Steph Curry update: The NBA\u2019s Golden Child has six 40-point games already this season after just three in his entire MVP season in 2014-15. He\u2019s also already earned six fourth quarters of total rest in the Warriors\u2019 first 20 games and is scoring 37.8 percent of his points this season in the third quarter. In total, Curry has rung up 640 points in 685 minutes on a mere 403 shots, while averaging 11.1 3-pointer attempts per game. The single-season record for 3s per game is Baron Davis\u2019 8.7 in 2003-04. ... Can\u2019t say I know exactly what the Sixers\u2019 young players are going through, but I think I have an inkling. A 15-game (or more) losing streak to start one\u2019s NBA career is not exclusive to Jahlil Okafor and T.J. McConnell, nor last season\u2019s unfortunate Philly rooks Nerlens Noel and K.J. McDaniels. The Clippers once had a trio of rookies who began their careers with an 0-16 nightmare: Lamond Murray, Eric Piatkowski and Matt Fish in 1994-95. And I will never forget it because it was my first full season on the NBA beat for the Los Angeles Daily News. ... As covered recently in this space, Bryant says he doesn\u2019t have any plans to satiate his fans abroad by playing a season in Italy or China when he\u2019s done with the NBA. But playing in the Olympics could serve as that farewell to the international basketball public, which Bryant addressed in a Friday morning visit on ESPN Radio with Mike and Mike, saying: \u201cObviously I grew up overseas and have seen basketball grow globally. It\u2019s come so far, so fast. (I) would love nothing more to be in an international environment and be around so many other great athletes one more time. That being said, it\u2019s not something I\u2019m obsessing over, either, because I\u2019ve got to listen to my body, too. If my body can\u2019t do it, there\u2019s no sense in doing it. So God willing, hopefully, if they feel I can make a significant contribution and my body is up for it ... if that\u2019s the case then I would love to play.\u201d\n\nThe List\n\nKevin McHale\u2019s 11 games in Houston before his dismissal are the second fewest in league history for a coach who returned to his team after a conference finals appearance in the previous season. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, only Gene Shue\u2019s six games with Philadelphia in the 1977-78 account for a shorter stay. McHale, mind you, was just 11 games into a new three-year contract.\n\nFewest Games Coached, Season Following Conference Finals\n\n1977-78: Philadelphia\u2019s Gene Shue -- 6\n\n2015-16: Houston\u2019s Kevin McHale -- 11\n\n1998-99: L.A.

Do you have a hazy absinthe-fueled memory of sitting at your laptop? Perhaps drafting anywhere from one to five fantasy basketball teams?\n\n(OK, that was me.)\n\nBut while we've been urging our imaginary football franchise on to heights previously unimagined in the annals of fantasy geekdom, your fantasy basketball franchise might have developed some issues.\n\nI'm right there with you.\n\nSome of my fantasy hoops teams are in first place. A couple are (very decidedly) not in first place. The teams that are struggling are most likely doing so because a player didn't perform to my own preseason expectations.\n\nEvery preseason, I spend countless hours putting together my own top-150 player auction valuations. I do this for ESPN.com, but it's also so I can pinpoint places where I see value from first-round bedrock to endgame gambles.\n\nI get most valuations right. But there are some players I short, and some I overrate.\n\nWe're nearly a third of the way into the season. By means of taking stock, I pinpointed 10 players who have stumbled out of the gate. My question is, are these players going to finish strong or are they mired in a season-long downgrade?\n\nLet's take a look at my 10 biggest disappointments of the 2015-16 fantasy basketball season and what to expect moving forward.\n\n2015 Player Rater: 16.98\n\n2016 Player Rater: 13.11\n\nLet's be clear: 13.11 player rater points ain't bad. Being seventh overall? For most fantasy portfolios, seventh should be enough.\n\nBut this is Anthony Davis we're talking about. I thought we were looking at a leap year. A season where Davis vaulted over Stephen Curry and became the top player in fantasy basketball. An MVP campaign, both in fantasy and reality.\n\nThe first third of Davis' 2015-16 season has to be regarded as a disappointment. Through Thanksgiving, I would have tabbed it \"epic disappointment.\" Davis has started to inch back into form, but it's a mirror of his 2014-15 numbers (his past-5 averages: 25.6 points, 10.8 rebounds, 2.8 blocks, .537 FG%, .800 FT%).\n\nSo what's been happening here? Some would talk about injuries out of the gate up and down the Pelicans' roster. The lack of consistent point guard play. The lack of healthy bodies in the post.\n\nFor fantasy purposes, I would refer you to Davis' 3-point production.\n\nComing into the season, the Mai Tai-suffused narrative out of New Orleans was that Davis was about to add 1.5 or so 3-pointers a night to his already gaudy box scores. It was a fun storyline, filed under the \"What's Davis' next magic trick?\" category. (Hey, I liked it too.)\n\nAnd while Davis' 3-point attempts have skyrocketed to a career-high 1.8 per game, his 3-point percentage stands at a decidedly pedestrian .306. And all of the low-efficiency 3-point attempts have put Davis' field goal percentage -- once a strength -- into a headlock.\n\nFurthermore, the long-range mentality is choking Davis' 2-point production. Last season, Davis led the NBA in made 2-point shots (641). He averaged 9.4 2-pointers per game at a .540 clip. In 2015-16, the numbers have dropped to 8.3 2-pointers at a .510 clip.\n\nAnd here's the thing: It's not getting any better. For December, across 14 games played, Davis is only shooting .481 from the floor. He's only hitting 29 percent of his 3s.\n\nYes, the blocks and rebounds are inching upward. But that's only thanks to more minutes (37.6 per game in December.) And by the way, considering Davis' injury history, don't want him playing 38 minutes a night.\n\nUntil the 3-point production gets ironed out, this experiment is going to keep Davis out of the conversation for fantasy MVP.\n\n2. Marc Gasol, C, Memphis Grizzlies\n\n2015 Player Rater: 12.18\n\n2016 Player Rater: 7.35\n\nGasol's secret sauce -- his assist production -- still packs its requisite punch. At 3.9 dimes a night, Gasol is still far and away the best facilitating center in fantasy. And those out-of-position assists are hugely underrated when gauging Gasol's real fantasy impact.\n\nWhen you draft Gasol, you're secretly employing an extra point guard. So why is he on this list? Why the drop from 12th overall to 38th?\n\nGasol's minutes have gone up from 33.2 to 34.3 per game. At the same time, Gasol's field goal percentage dropped from .494 to .471.\n\nAnd while the minutes have risen, the volume of attempts has dropped, to 12.6 per game. The drop in Gasol's fantasy production is mostly due to this drop in 2-point production.\n\nGasol's rebounding has dipped to just 7.6 per game. But what's especially troubling is the blocks production. They've dropped from 1.6 to 1.1 per game. That's tied for a career low. You need your center to block shots. As their careers progress, players block fewer shots per game.\n\nAre we looking at permanent downgrade? Was 2014-15 Gasol's peak season?\n\nI'm not so sure.\n\nA couple of years ago, I tabbed Gasol as an \"every-other-year player.\" (You know, in the same way Pavement used to be an \"every-other-album band.\" Cripes, I'm old.)\n\nBut take a look at Gasol's career arc. Gasol seems to alternate boffo leap years (with 80 or so games played) with years where he plays only 60-70 games and mildly disappoints.\n\nLast season was a leap year, a career campaign. The difference with this season is that you can't blame Gasol's fantasy dip on injury. He's played every game for the Grizzlies. So what's happening here? Is this another one of Gasol's scheduled off years?\n\nI'm not so sure.\n\nAs a big man, Gasol's offensive production is teammate-dependent. And November was a bad month for Memphis' offensive production. As a team, the Grizzlies shot only 42 percent from the floor in November.\n\nIn December, the Grizzlies' offense is trending up. They're shooting 45 percent. They're averaging 96.5 points per game. They're not the Warriors yet, but it's an improvement. And Gasol has followed suit. His December line: 17.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.4 blocks with a .490 FG%.\n\nGasol is a secret a buy-low opportunity.\n\n3. Jeff Teague, PG, Atlanta Hawks\n\n2015 Player Rater: 10.30\n\n2016 Player Rater: 5.86\n\nAt 27, Teague should be entering his peak productivity. So why has Teague regressed?\n\nIt's simple. Teague's been dealing with ankle issues all year. He wasn't attacking the rim the way he did in his career 2014-15 campaign. (I always look to field goal production from 0-3 feet as an indicator of lost burst, and Teague's shooting a career-low .532 at the rim.)\n\nWhile waiting for Teague to get healthy, I've had another worry: Dennis Schroder. I've been terrified Schroder might build just enough consistency to turn Atlanta's point guard slot into a mild timeshare.\n\nBut while Schroder has turned in some fine single-game performances, he's still a defensive liability. Which means Schroder is still locked in as Teague's backup.\n\nThe latest quotes from Teague have him pronouncing his ankle as being pain-free. If that's true, this might be your last chance to buy low.\n\n4. Gordon Hayward, SG/SF, Utah Jazz\n\n2015 Player Rater: 9.92\n\n2016 Player Rater: 6.36\n\nI've never been a huge Hayward fan. Hayward's fantasy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 has always sported a sizable ding; he's a mediocre midrange shooter. Hayward settles for too many deep 2-point attempts, and he's not that great at converting them.\n\nHow can an NBA wing player hit 40 percent of his 3-point attempts, yet still only sport an overall field-goal percentage of .431? Bad 2-point production.\n\nThis season, Hayward has regressed from midrange. He's gone from mediocre to occasionally terrifying. He's only shooting 38 percent from 10-to-16 feet and 33 percent from 16-to-23 feet.\n\nDespite my ranting, this is not all Hayward's fault. Have you seen any Jazz games? Have you witnessed the goopy, viscous amalgamation that is the Utah Jazz point guard rotation?\n\nA wing player needs space, and Utah's point guards (Raul Neto and Trey Burke) haven't provided a lot of room to operate.\n\nDespite all this, Hayward has trended up the past two weeks. I don't think he'll surpass his 2014-15 production, but he's a good bet to match it the rest of the way.\n\n2015 Player Rater: 9.79\n\n2016 Player Rater: 0.18\n\nThe cratering of Danny Green has been one of the leading geek storylines of 2015-16. I've gone from shocked to numb. I could spit out stats, but that player-rater drop says it all.\n\nSeveral Spurs (LaMarcus Aldridge, Tim Duncan) have been fantasy disappointments. We can talk new systems. New players in the rotation. But we're talking about a career 41 percent 3-point shooter suddenly dropping to just 30 percent. (And it's not minutes. The minutes -- 26.1 per game -- are still there.)\n\nBut at the end of the day, I think we're just looking at a classic, Marianas Trench-deep, post-contract hangover.\n\n6. Gorgui Dieng, PF/C, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\n2015 Player Rater: 7.87\n\n2016 Player Rater: 4.45\n\nI fully anticipated Karl-Anthony Towns stealing a sliver of Dieng's fantasy thunder. What I wasn't expecting was the early season spike in Nemanja Bjelica's playing time.\n\nThat early season experiment seems to have concluded. Slowly and surely, Dieng is eating up more frontcourt minutes. As the season progresses -- and Kevin Garnett is rested more -- Dieng's value will rise.\n\n7. Rudy Gay, SF/PF, Sacramento Kings.\n\n2015 Player Rater: 9.05\n\n2016 Player Rater: 5.92\n\nI think Gay is more hurt than he's letting on. We read a lot about his shoulder issues earlier in the season, but those stories got smothered by ones of general Sacramento nuttiness.\n\nHere's the thing: Despite all of Sacramento's reality-show-ready dysfunctionality, Gay's been the Kings' best all-around fantasy player in December with a 5.93 player-rater score.\n\nThat's still not good. I can't recommend buying or selling on Gay. He's a hold (and hope his shoulder heals.)\n\n8. Tim Duncan, PF/C, San Antonio Spurs\n\n2015 Player Rater: 10.56\n\n2016 Player Rater: 5.20\n\nOver the past couple of seasons, one of my most-typed sentences has been \"I'll stop believing in Tim Duncan when the wheels fall off.\"\n\nIn this case, it's a knee. Duncan is clearly being conserved for the playoffs, and may have passed his sell-by date in fantasy.\n\nDuncan's still a sneakily productive fantasy asset. He's still a nightly threat for a double-double and 1.5 blocks. Duncan will undoubtedly have a few hot weeks this season. But his days of age-defying, top-15 value are probably over.\n\n9. Trevor Ariza, SG/SF, Houston Rockets\n\n2015 Player Rater: 9.13\n\n2016 Player Rater: 4.13\n\nAriza is still outperforming his ninth-round ADP. Just remember, he started slowly in 2014-15. The Rockets were bad in November. Buy low.\n\n10. Markieff Morris, SF/PF, Phoenix Suns\n\n2015 Player Rater: 7.48\n\n2016 Player Rater: -0.52\n\nThe towel-chucking suspension is just icing. If it weren't for Danny Green, Markieff Morris would be the fantasy flameout of 2015.\n\nWhat can I say? What have we learned? Don't trade someone's brother to Detroit?\n\nOr maybe it's just that Marcus Morris is the more stable fantasy investment.\n\nIt's hard to recommend rostering Markieff at present. But a return to fantasy relevance may just be a trade away.", "Bill Belichick\u2019s Call Wasn\u2019t Entirely Stupid": "Every so often, Bill Belichick seems to get a little too cute in a high-leverage situation for his own good. At a glance, Sunday\u2019s loss to the Jets, in which the Patriots won the coin toss and elected to kick off to begin overtime, seems to be a major example. But although the execution (and, certainly, the result) were about as undesirable as could be, it wasn\u2019t exactly a major blunder, because the decision to kick or receive in overtime is more minor than it appears.\n\nFrom the jump, the move was snakebit. After receiving his marching orders from Belichick (in quadruplicate!), special teams captain Matthew Slater mistakenly phrased the call so that New England chose to kick \u2014 not which goal to defend. Belichick says he was playing for field position, so the wind, which reached 18 mph at times, was pretty clearly a factor. By electing to kick in the first place, Belichick was already going off the reservation: It was only the 13th time in NFL history that a coach had won the overtime toss but did not choose to receive the ball first, practically inviting second-guessers. But to make the move and then have the NFL\u2019s Byzantine rulebook begin parsing parts of speech at the precise worst time, well, that\u2019s just piling on.\n\nStill, although the numbers say Belichick\u2019s strategy to kick would have been ill-considered even if Slater hadn\u2019t misspoken, it wasn\u2019t as big a mistake as it might have seemed.\n\nFor one thing, getting the ball first in OT doesn\u2019t give the receiving team a huge advantage. Since the NFL adopted its current regular-season overtime rules in 2012, teams that win the toss and receive the ball first have gone on to win only 51.5 percent of the time. That\u2019s a bit lower than ESPN\u2019s modeled probability of 53.8 percent, but a drive-based model also suggests that getting the ball first is not of earth-shattering importance. Since 2012, teams receiving the ball to start OT have scored an opening-drive touchdown (thereby winning the game while denying the opponent a possession) about 16 percent of the time. They\u2019ve also failed to score at all 64 percent of the time \u2014 and those failed drives can have a big effect on the outcome of the next drive.\n\nConditional on how its opponent\u2019s previous drive ends, the average team kicking at the start of OT can have a pretty good opportunity to quickly counter-attack and end the game. Although a team that allows an opening touchdown by definition loses 100 percent of the time, and a team that allows an opening field goal loses 69 percent of the time, the kicking team scores a game-winning touchdown or field goal on 49 percent of drives that follow a zero-point opponent possession to begin overtime. (One big reason? Such drives start roughly 11 yards closer to the opponent\u2019s goal line than drives after an opponent field goal.) If the kicking team can force a stop on the first drive of OT, it briefly finds itself very well-positioned to win the game.\n\nEstimated probability of winning overtime, 2012\u201315 FIRST TEAM TO \u2026 DRIVES INTO OVERTIME GAMES RECEIVE KICK STILL TIED 1st exchange 67 30% 31% 39% 2nd exchange 25 47 41 13 3rd exchange 7 52 44 4 BASED ON DATA FROM PRO-FOOTBALL-REFERENCE.COM\n\nAfter the first \u201cexchange\u201d of possessions, things start to go poorly for the team that kicked off at the beginning of OT. Because sudden-death rules take over, the team has to rely on joint probability \u2014 the odds of getting a stop and the odds of scoring \u2014 to win after any given pair of possessions. Its opponent, meanwhile, can strike first and end the game then and there. So to maximize its odds of winning, the original kicking team must capitalize on the brief window of opportunity it has at the end of overtime\u2019s first exchange of possessions.\n\nBelichick must have believed his Patriots could do just that. You can kind of see the grumpy old wheels turning: His defense had allowed fewer points through the end of regulation than the league average, and the Jets have basically been an average offensive team this season, so a defensive stop may have seemed more likely than the baseline NFL rate of 64 percent. And despite the furious pass rush Tom Brady faced much of the day, New England probably would have had a better-than-average chance of answering a potential zero-point possession with a game-winning drive, particularly if the wind had been on the Pats\u2019 side.\n\nIn a sense, that\u2019s all abstract odds-making. In reality, Belichick, Slater and the coaching staff botched the coin-toss decision, and the Jets orchestrated a brilliant series of big plays against the New England defense en route to the winning touchdown. Amid all that, the choice to kick is drowned out by all the other noise once overtime play starts.\n\nRead more: FiveThirtyEight\u2019s NFL predictions", "Lucas Browne to challenge Ruslan Chagaev for secondary heavyweight belt": "Ruslan Chagaev will defend his secondary heavyweight title against mandatory challenger Lucas \"Big Daddy\" Browne on March 5 at Akhmat Arena in Grozny, Russia, organizers announced Friday.\n\nAlthough Browne has been the mandatory challenger since February, Chagaev was due to face Fres Oquendo in a rematch on Oct. 17 in Kiel, Germany. However, Oquendo suffered a serious shoulder injury just two weeks before the fight, causing the rematch to be delayed indefinitely. That opened the door for Browne to get the next shot at Chagaev, who holds a second-tier belt to world champion Tyson Fury.\n\n\"I fully intend to become Australia's first-ever heavyweight world champion,\" Browne said. \"Make no mistake: I'm going over to Grozny to knock Ruslan Chagaev out. I'm not interested in leaving the fight in the hands of the judges so I'm going to bring my two judges with me, my left hand and my right hand.\n\n\"I've already started the process of turning my body into a machine and I'm going to destroy whatever is in front of me. Traveling overseas to fight doesn't bother me in the slightest. I've done it many times in my career and at the end of the day it'll be just me and Chagaev in the ring.\"\n\nBrowne (23-0, 20 KOs), 36, who is promoted by former junior welterweight champion Ricky Hatton, fought only once in 2015. The fight was a much harder than expected ninth-round knockout of journeyman Julius Long on Aug. 14. One reason for Browne's layoff was the waiting game as mandatory challenger.\n\n\"I can't thank Ricky Hatton and Hatton Promotions enough for getting me the opportunity. For one reason or another, this fight has been hard to make and I have to praise Ricky and his team for their hard work,\" Browne said.\n\nSaid Matt Clark, Browne's manager, \"We've been waiting patiently for this fight to materialize and it's well worth the wait. It's going to be an incredible atmosphere in Grozny and we are looking forward to putting on a great show and making Australian boxing history.\"\n\nChagaev (34-2-1, 21 KOs), 37, a native of Uzbekistan living in Germany, will be defending his belt for the second time. He scored a controversial majority decision win against Oquendo to claim the vacant belt in July 2014 in Grozny and then was idle for a year until making a defense on July 11, knocking out Francesco Pianeta in the first round in Magdeburg, Germany.", "Felix training to run 200, 400 at Olympics on same day": "American sprinter Allyson Felix's training is all geared toward the finish line in the 200 and 400 meters at the Rio Olympics. Schedule allowing, she hopes to be in the starting blocks for both races.\n\nProblem is, those events are scheduled to happen 75 minutes apart.\n\nTo facilitate Felix's pursuit, USA Track and Field recently petitioned the governing body of the sport to amend the Olympic track program, which currently has the 200 preliminaries taking place just over an hour before the 400 final in Rio on Aug. 15.\n\nThat would leave little opportunity for the six-time Olympic medalist to recover.\n\nShe won't be deterred, though, should the rescheduling not happen. She still plans on attempting to make the U.S. squad in both events at the Olympic Trials in July and go from there.\n\n\"I think she can make the team in both. I think she's capable of medaling in both. I think she has a great opportunity to win gold medals in both,\" her longtime coach, Bobby Kersee said in a phone interview. \"She's very dedicated to it. She's committed to the challenge.\"\n\nA change to the schedule is not without precedent, even at this late date. Michael Johnson campaigned for a rearrangement of the 200 and 400 events leading up to the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. The program was altered, and he became the first male to win both at the Olympics.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said four months ago that the Olympic track program remains flexible.\n\nUSATF CEO Max Siegel went to bat for the 30-year-old Felix by contacting the International Association of Athletics Federations to set the wheels in motion for a switch.\n\n\"Such an achievement would elevate the sport at the Games, and as a federation we owe it to her and to the sport as a whole to make the request,\" Siegel said in a statement.\n\nThey're currently in a holding pattern. An email was sent to the IAAF to determine the next step.\n\nSebastian Coe, the head of IAAF, said over the summer that the organization would be willing investigate such a schedule change.\n\nKersee has Felix working as though this kind of double could take place. They started training in October, and Felix will run a limited indoor schedule this winter to stay race sharp. She may also compete at the world indoor championships in Portland, Oregon, in March.\n\n\"I don't want her to sit around,\" Kersee said. \"So we're treating indoors more like spring training. We're going to perform a couple of times and shut it down and get ready for outdoor.\"\n\nAsked what his ideal timetable would be for her to reasonably compete in Rio -- two hours? Six hours? A day? -- Kersee didn't commit.\n\n\"I'm just going through our major channels -- asking the powers that be to talk to the other powers that be,\" he said. \"I'm a better track coach than politician.\n\n\"It's been done before. It's nothing new. If you look at the history and look at the schedule, you know what's fair and you go from there.\"\n\nThis 200-400 undertaking by Felix has been in the works for the last five years. Felix tackled the sprint-distance double at the 2011 world championships in South Korea, winning silver in the 400. A few days later, she lacked her customary kick and was clearly exhausted in the 200, her signature event. She wound up with bronze.\n\nFelix didn't attempt that endeavor at the 2012 London Games. Instead, she ran the 100 and the 200, winning gold in the latter. She also won gold in both relays.\n\nShe's much stronger now, Kersee said, pointing to her performance at worlds last summer in Beijing. Focusing on the 400, Felix won the event and then helped the relay teams to silver medals. Her leg of the 4x400 relay was particularly strong.\n\n\"Last season, she was (in her best shape ever),\" Kersee said. \"Barring injury, we can build off of that. We know we have a task ahead of us. We're committed to it.\n\n\"If we have an athlete that's capable of maybe wanting to try that, why not give them the opportunity? That's my Perry Mason argument.\"", "NBA: TrueHoop Presents -- Kobe Bryant's 'all-day process'": "Kobe Bryant sits down with Michael Wilbon to discuss his upcoming retirement and the legacy he will leave in the NBA. (3:21)\n\nMany years ago, when Kobe Bryant's games were filled with explosive attacking moves and windmill dunks, the work he put into stretching, ice baths, massages and the like between games was \"zero,\" in his estimation.\n\nNow that he is 37, with an injury history in nearly every major joint, plus a staggering 56,000-plus total NBA minutes on his resume, things could hardly be more different.\n\n\"The kid has got a lot of miles on him,\" says Los Angeles Lakers head athletic trainer Gary Vitti, in his 32nd season with the team. \"And they're hard miles. They're hard miles. If you've ever been to Maui, the Road to Hana? It's a rough road, man. It's beautiful when you get there, but it's a rough road.\"\n\nBryant's days are stuffed with an ever-evolving and carefully curated series of treatments designed to minimize injury and maximize performance, including submerging himself in icy water and lying on tables while an array of experts go to work. There is also physical therapy, which often involves digging at his legs with a $3,500 device resembling a small jackhammer.\n\nThe Lakers employ a large staff of physical therapists, trainers and massage therapists, some of whom say their main focus is Bryant. But Bryant consumes so much time and refined expertise, at all hours, that he has long supplemented with outside experts, including a neuromuscular therapist, two chiropractors (one in Orange County, where he lives, and another in Los Angeles), an active-release therapist from Oceanside in San Diego County, several \"stretch professionals\" and a personal strength-and-conditioning trainer.\n\nIf Bryant is to complete his 20th (and final) season, it's because all of those professionals have done their jobs well, teasing explosive potential from Bryant's aging body.\n\n\"There's rooms that he goes to and people are there and things happen,\" Tim DiFrancesco, the Lakers' head strength and conditioning coach for the past five seasons, says with a laugh. \"So much is done behind the scenes that are behind the scenes.\"\n\nMarko Yrjovuori, the Lakers' sports massage therapist, says Kobe's last game will be \"sad for everybody.\" Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nThere is no normal game-day routine for Kobe Bryant, and members of the Lakers' training staff who tend to Bryant on a daily basis -- some of whom have done so for his entire career -- say they cannot emphasize that point enough.\n\nThere is only, the team's specialists add, how Bryant is feeling that day, which varies.\n\nBoth Bryant and the specialists often call this stage \"uncharted territory,\" because no guard has played this long, and it's all but unheard of for an athlete to still play after suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon, let alone do so at his age. Add it all up, and there's no blueprint to follow.\n\nIt would probably be easier for all involved if Bryant, who played in his record 16th Christmas Day game Friday night against the Clippers, merely wished just to remain upright and serviceable, but that isn't the case. \"It's tough. He wants to ride out at a high level, not in a nice way, but at a high level,\" says Dr. Judy Seto, the Lakers' head physical therapist. \"It's not enough to just be out there. He needs to play the way he plays. Otherwise, for him, what's the point?\"\n\nSo every day is, as Bryant often calls it, a \"puzzle\" for both him and the staff. What must they assemble? Him.\n\nHe consistently calls keeping his body in order an \"all-day process,\" and if there is a normal game day, or something that's even in the same ballpark, it typically begins long before Bryant even arrives at the arena in the midafternoon, when he meets with a personal trainer to target whatever body part (or parts) ail him at that very moment.\n\nEditor's Picks Holmes/Young: Kobe Bryant relishes final challenges from Kevin Durant Kobe Bryant savored his matchup with Kevin Durant, even after getting a rude awakening with blocks at the hands of the Thunder star, Baxter Holmes and Royce Young write.\n\nHolmes: Kobe flips the script on his farewell season Kobe Bryant's game was tough to watch for the first 17 games, but over the last seven, he's starting to \"feel like me again.\" 1 Related\n\nBryant's toes, feet, Achilles tendons, especially the left one that he ruptured in April 2013, are often stretched. Resistance band exercises for his knees and ankles help improve range of motion, gauged with an arthrodial protractor, helping suggest treatment and measure improvements in flexibility of ligaments and muscles.\n\nThen Bryant travels to the arena, often arriving at some point between two and four hours before tipoff, giving him plenty of time to complete a gauntlet of therapies.\n\nInitially, Bryant might work himself into a lather on the court through his shooting routine, make a quick stop in the weight room, or ice down; his routine varies depending on how he's feeling. But, typically, he first meets with Seto, who joined the Lakers in a consulting role in 1990 and is now in her fifth full-time season. To help improve his range of motion or correct any alignment that might be off, she will focus on his neck, shoulders, knees, ankles or any specific spot that Bryant says needs some work. \"I take his feedback and take it from there,\" she says. The whole session lasts 10 to 15 minutes, as anything longer might fatigue his muscles.\n\nThen, about a half-hour before the game, Bryant will meet with Marko Yrjovuori, the Lakers' sports massage therapist for the past 12 seasons who is more commonly known as \"Finn,\" a nod to his Finnish roots.\n\nYrjovuori will help stretch Bryant's limbs for about 20 minutes, with about 80 percent of the focus on Bryant's lower body. He'll also use a hand-held percussion device called The Raptor, which can penetrate several layers of muscle with up to 3,600 percussions per minute to help shake Bryant's muscles awake.\n\nNot long before tip, Bryant meets with DiFrancesco. As Bryant listens to Lakers' coaches discuss pregame strategy, he works with DiFrancesco for a five-minute session of hip and glute exercises -- often using a resistance band -- to help \"activate\" his lower body.\n\n(For road games, DiFrancesco also makes sure that at a predetermined time before the game that Bryant receives bone broth specially made by the chefs at the team hotel.)\n\nBryant's pregame process might last 40 minutes, a churn from one activity to the next. While his teammates are gabbing in the locker room, he can often be found in a back room, his body being kneaded, stretched, loosened and otherwise prepared in some form or fashion.\n\nThe order is crucial.\n\n\"You don't want them to do strengthening work if they're out of alignment,\" Seto says. \"You want to get them in alignment first and then activate the muscle and then do a little bit more strengthening before they get on the court.\" Members of the Lakers' training staff must also work with other Lakers players before the game, but as expected, they say that Bryant is the priority.\n\n\"He's the main focus,\" Yrjovuori says.\n\n\"His last game, it's going to be sad for everybody. [It's like], 'What am I going to do from now on?'\" Marko Yrjovuori, the Lakers' sports massage therapist\n\nThe work doesn't stop there. During games, Lakers coach Byron Scott tries -- though he doesn't always succeed -- to stagger Bryant's minutes, so that Bryant plays about 30 -- or around there -- but doesn't spend long stretches on the bench, lest his legs become stiff. And even when he's on the bench, Bryant has tried to stay loose, as well.\n\nFor instance, during a Dec. 2 win over the Wizards in Washington, where Bryant scored a season-high 31 points on 10-of-24 shooting in 36 minutes, he ran in place and bounced up and down on the sideline when he wasn't in the game.\n\nAfterward, Bryant jokingly compared himself to the over-the-top exercises Jim Carrey's zany character did before a basketball game in the movie \"Cable Guy.\"\n\n\"During a game, I just try to move around as much as possible,\" Bryant says. \"Normally, when you sit on the bench, you try to rest your legs. It's like, f--- that. Rest ain't gonna make no difference -- if I can't move, it's not going to f---ing matter.'\"\n\nAfter games, Bryant's sessions with various Lakers specialists are lighter and shorter, with an emphasis on relaxing his muscles, rather than activating them. And, as he does following practices, Bryant will ice his knees and shoulders. (Seto points out that Bryant is \"certainly utilizing the cold tub\" a lot more.) He also will drink chocolate milk -- a low-sugar blend of organic cocoa and whole milk from grass-fed cows that's specially prepared by a Whole Foods based in whichever NBA city the team is in.\n\nIt might seem like a lot of work for maybe 30 minutes of floor time, but every aspect of Bryant's preparation for and recovery from games has never been more crucial.\n\n\"They have a greater effect, a greater consequence, a greater benefit,\" Seto says. \"Maybe because you're so flexible when you're younger, you can spring [and] maybe you don't see that big a benefit in stretching, rest and recovery, icing, all of that. You can get away with eating unhealthy. Now, as you're getting older, it makes a huge difference. That little 2 to 3 percent difference as you're getting older is huge.\"\n\nFor those who work with Bryant daily, the importance of each step is even more magnified as he nears the end of his storied career.\n\n\"I know his last game is coming,\" Seto says. \"But it doesn't change what I've been doing with him, because it's been working.\"\n\nAs Yrjovuori explains, \"It's an honor to be part of it. His last game, it's going to be sad for everybody. [It's like], 'What am I going to do from now on?'\"\n\nDr. Judy Seto, the Lakers' head physical therapist, has been working closely with Kobe for years. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nBryant says all of his various specialists have different fortes. For example, one chiropractor might specialize in one area, while the other favors a different approach.\n\n\"That's why I have multiple ones, so I can balance out what my body needs,\" Bryant says. \"If it's something for the lower extremity, this guy does it better. If it's something [else], this guy may do it better. It's like putting a puzzle together.\"\n\nSo many of those pieces are put in place before Bryant reaches the arena.\n\n\"He's constantly doing things,\" Vitti says. \"Then he comes in and he's getting fine-tuned.\"\n\nAs Seto explains, \"Because of the work that he puts in before, on a day-to-day basis, it takes less time to get him ready.\"\n\nBryant is responsible for speeding up that process: One aspect that members of the Lakers' training staff each praised was Bryant's knowledge not only of his own body but also of medical minutia in general, which helps him specify what exactly he needs adjusted on a given day.\n\n\"Over the years, he's paid attention to what people would say to him,\" Vitti says. \"So he knows what iliotibial band syndrome is. He knows what the quadratus lumborum is. He knows what the erector spinae is. He'll come in and say, 'I need this released.' A lot of guys, they don't want to know all that ... but he wants to know. 'What are you doing? What is that?' He's always been that way. You've got to give him credit for that.\"\n\nAnother element that Vitti praised is Bryant recently adopting Fusionetics, a sports science-infused injury prevention and recovery enhancement/performance improvement program founded by physical therapist Dr. Mike Clark that is used by several professional teams.\n\n\"I think in the last year, Kobe has finally bought into this Fusionetics thing, and his training has become much better, in my opinion,\" Vitti says.\n\n\"He's always spent a lot of time on his body. But, just like anything else, especially at this level, it's not enough to do a lot. It's not enough to work hard. You've got to work smart. And he is really working smart right now.\"\n\n\"The single greatest thing that stops people from exercising as they age is lack of flexibility. So you can see him stiffening up.\" Gary Vitti\n\n\"I'm behind him 100 percent with the way he's training now and I haven't always felt that way, because when you don't train right, you actually train yourself into default position, which makes it harder for us to get you out of it.\"\n\nVitti added, \"Breaking through the wall, working harder, harder, harder -- not anymore. If you keep training into fatigue, then you're going to train yourself into that position. That's what we're trying to get you out of.\"\n\nBryant calls Fusionetics \"extremely helpful.\"\n\nThat Bryant is working with outside trainers or experts is not unusual by any stretch.\n\n\"He's always gone outside the loop, not 100 percent, but he's always had his own guy, partially because he's on his own time schedule,\" Vitti says. \"If he wants to go work out at 2 in the morning, I can't have Tim [doing that]. He's got 14 other guys to be responsible for. So Kobe needs somebody who's willing to do that. As a result, not all these guys last. He burns through them.\"\n\nYrjovuori smiled and says, \"For us, it's impossible with our schedules already, but for the people that he uses, it's a hell of a challenge.\n\nYrjovuori then shook his head and laughed.\n\n\"I've had my share of late-night phone calls,\" he says. \"I've done my share of drives down to Orange County.\"\n\nDiFrancesco says Bryant's workload \"is already more than most could handle,\" but now he goes through these tedious processes just about every day.\n\n\"It's tough, but I love the game, though,\" Bryant says. \"It doesn't matter what you have to go through. When you're willing to go through a very tedious process for something, meaning that's when you know you really, really love it. I don't mind it.\"\n\nHis approach is a stark turnaround from his early NBA days, Bryant says: \"I come in the gym and windmill [dunk] like nothing. Now I've got to stretch to touch the backboard. I [could] literally come in here and wake up, get out of bed and do [360-degree dunks]. How crazy is that?\"\n\nAs Seto explains, \"Before, he could give it his all and he'd recover the next day, no big deal. And then do it again, no big deal. Because he could recover. Now, it's let's see how you're doing tomorrow, because we're not sure how you're going to recover. Then we're going to have to wait until the next day happens.\"\n\nAs time has passed, Bryant has changed, because he's had no other choice if he wanted to continue his career.\n\n\"He was so talented and so driven throughout his career that maybe not everything had to work right in his body,\" Vitti says. \"But now that he can't do it anymore, in order to even play at the level that he's playing, he has to do everything right, and he realizes that. And somehow he's found his way.\"\n\nFor much of this season, it didn't look like Bryant would find his way at all.\n\nBefore a game has even started, Kobe has been doin' work. Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n\nFollowing a mid-November win against the Detroit Pistons in which he logged 36 minutes, Bryant stood at his locker and declared, \"I can barely stand up. My feet and legs are killing me.\" He later added, \"I'm not looking forward to the walk to the car.\"\n\nBefore that game -- and certainly after -- Bryant complained about his legs, and it was clear that they couldn't provide the lift on his jump shot, which led to many of his shots hitting nothing but air, including several throughout various games.\n\n\"As you get older, you get stiffer,\" Vitti says. \"The single greatest thing that stops people from exercising as they age is lack of flexibility. So you can see him stiffening up. You can see he doesn't have the same speed. He doesn't have the same lift on his jump shot. It's harder for that ball to get to the basket when you're using your upper extremity instead of your lower extremity to launch.\" Though determined to play in every game of his final season, Bryant's body clearly wasn't cooperating. In his first 17 games, he shot 29.6 percent from the field on 17.9 field-goal attempts per game.\n\nThat trend turned Dec. 7 in Toronto, where Bryant posted his first game of 50 percent shooting (8 of 16) of the season. Over the next seven games, Bryant's minutes and shots went down, and his percentage shot up to 48.2. Bryant pointed to a Dec. 11 game against San Antonio when he felt like he turned the corner, because his legs felt fresh when he expected them to be weary toward the end of an eight-game road trip.\n\nAll along, Bryant has preached that he just needed to find his rhythm after being sidelined for nearly nine months following a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder (among the injuries that have kept him on the shelf for the better part of the past three seasons).\n\n\"I think it's a combination of everything,\" he explains. \"It's not like [I'm] doing something in the moment in time. But I think it's over a period and being consistent -- being consistent with the stretching, being consistent with the hydration, nutrition and with the ice baths and the therapy and things like that. I think a combination of all those things over a period of time will get your body in a very solid place, which is where I'm at right now, and hopefully I can stay there.\"\n\nAnd just as Bryant comes to grips with how he must maintain his body and what it can do at this point, he has also had to accept everything that is physically slipping away, even though he remains mentally sharp.\n\n\"That's 100 percent correct,\" he says. \"Stuff that you're used to doing -- 'I'm just going to go by this guy' -- it's like, 'Wait a minute. Nah, I can't do that. F--- it, I'm just going to back 'em down.'\n\n\"That's true, though. Your mind can see certain things going on, when in the past, it was just one step and get there. Now, you can't. You've got to figure out a new way to get to the same spot.\"\n\nLongtime Lakers trainer Gary Vitti says this stage of Kobe's career is \"uncharted territory.\" Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nOn days when he doesn't play a game, Bryant says he focuses on stretching, and he will hop on the treadmill and run for about five or six minutes between 8 mph to 11 mph \"just to keep my legs going\" and the blood flowing.\n\nHe also says he hits the weights three or four times a week. The sweat-filled sessions feature plenty of resistance band training, weight jackets and the like. DiFrancesco has described past workouts as lasting between 20 to 40 minutes, being \"extremely quiet and focused\" and including \"traditional strength-building exercises: deadlift variation, squat variation, lunge variation, upper-body press variation, row variation, chin-ups.\"\n\nIn terms of massages and more physical therapy, Bryant says he works plenty on off days with Seto, along with a couple of his other physical therapists. Sessions can last about 30 minutes and might begin around 10 a.m., usually focus on joints from the hips to his right shoulder and more, with the goal being to maximize mobility and stretch brittle ligaments.\n\nThen comes ice, perhaps the most regular recovery activity. He'll ice his shoulders, knees, toes, with each part requiring a different amount of time, perhaps around 15 minutes.\n\nEverything is geared toward making sure his body holds up enough so that he can take the court again for the next game, but there's only so much that can be done.\n\n\"I have concerns,\" Vitti says. \"I'm not concerned about his Achilles tendon that he tore, and I'm not concerned about his rotator cuff that he tore, but he has another Achilles tendon and he has two patella tendons. And you've got another rotator cuff.\n\nThen Vitti offered an analogy:\n\nA young player is traveling down a road and accidentally falls into a hole, but the player recovers. As the player matures, he learns which roads have holes and how to get around them carefully -- or if it's best to take a different road altogether.\n\n\"I think that's what he's trying to figure out,\" Vitti says, \"How can I get to the same place but in a different way?\"\n\nHow does one do that?\n\n\"We don't really know,\" Vitti says. \"It's uncharted territory.\"\n\nThe end of the road is near, and there is a distant question of how Bryant's body will hold up many years down the line, given all that he has put it through in the past 20.\n\n\"Almost all NBA players are on some kind of workers' compensation later on in life,\" Vitti says. \"Basically, they wear out the articulating cartilage in their knees. That's what we end up calling osteoarthritis. Almost all these guys, hip and knee issues, later on in life. He has some [cartilage] issues from playing. And that may come back and haunt him down the road, we'll see.\"\n\nHas Bryant looked that far ahead? He has.\n\n\"Yeah, I've given it plenty of thought,\" Bryant says. \"I tend to feel pretty comfortable that my body is going to feel OK because of how I feel now, and I'm still putting so much stress on it. I feel pretty comfortable with that. I've had some really serious injuries, but they haven't been -- knock on wood -- back-related. The back is always something that scares the s--- out of me. So, fortunately I haven't had that. Other injuries have been injuries that I've been able to repair.\"\n\nWhile he has been searching for a healthy, sustainable balance, Bryant has also been taking what he calls \"baby steps\" to see what he's capable of, even during games.\n\n\"You're so used to pushing on the gas pedal, and it's there and it's been limitless,\" says Seto. \"Now, it's not limitless. During a game, it's hard to know -- from game to game, back-to-back, on the road -- where the 'E' is that day. It's tough to know.\"\n\nEvery day is now a search to see what Bryant can offer on that particular day without overdoing it.\n\n\"He's trying to keep things in reserve, but we don't know how much you have in your tank,\" Seto says. \"It's like, 'How do you know how much you have in reserve?' He's trying to find it.\"\n\nAs Bryant explains, \"It's impossible to gauge, because you don't know what's left. You don't know where that needle goes to the point where now the engine jumps out the car. So you've got to take baby steps, incrementally.\"\n\nBryant then points to the Dec. 17 loss against the Houston Rockets.\n\n\"If you watch the Houston game, there was the first drive, where I went by Trevor [Ariza] and laid it up,\" he says. \"That was the first drive I took all season where I really exploded to the rim. I laid it up and I went, 'That felt good.' That was a baby step.\n\n\"I got back in the huddle. I said, 'I felt good. Maybe I can dunk one.'\n\n\"Then when I had the opportunity again, I tried it.\"\n\nAnd so he did, throwing down a thunderous one-handed dunk that brought the Staples Center crowd to its collective feet.\n\n\"It's like a step-by-step [process],\" Bryant says.\n\n\"It's crazy to have to think about it.\n\n\"Back in the day ...\"\n\nThen his voice trails off, and he smiles.", "Andy Murray issues rankings challenge to Davis Cup teammates": "Andy Murray has challenged his Davis Cup-winning teammates to use the success as a springboard to climb the rankings in 2016.\n\nJames Ward and Kyle Edmund were part of the four-man line-up that defeated Belgium in the final in Ghent at the weekend, while Dan Evans also received a trophy having played in the semi-final against Australia.\n\nWard was the only man other than Andy and Jamie Murray to win a rubber during this year's remarkable Davis Cup run when he beat America's John Isner in the first round in March.\n\nThe 28-year-old finally cracked the top 100 for the first time following his run to the third round at Wimbledon but has since slipped back to 156 in the rankings.\n\nEdmund sits two places outside the top 100 and next year will be a significant one for him, while Evans has climbed back from a low of 772 in May to 185.\n\nYet all are part of a team now ranked No.1 in the world, and Murray believes the trio can do better.\n\nHe said: \"It's amazing, and we deserve to be ranked No.1 in the world because the last five years, we've only lost two matches.\n\n\"James and Kyle, and Dan as well, the last few weeks they've all won Challenger events. I think everyone believes that all of them can go higher.\n\n\"With this coming up, there was a huge motivation for everybody to go out and perform and prepare really well for this tie, and they did that. It's now about taking that form and that level into next year.\"\n\nAndy Murray has challenged his Davis Cup teammates to kick on from their tournament victory last weekend. Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nEdmund intends to do just that, having been inspired by his first experience of Davis Cup tennis.\n\nThe 20-year-old said: \"It's just the whole experience, being involved. Being in such an intense environment, you're never going to experience that on the tour so you take that and use it to kick on.\"\n\nBritain begin the defence of their title against Japan in Birmingham in March, and captain Leon Smith sees no reason for 2015 to be a one-off.\n\nHe said: \"We should be a team that's very confident, very proud and one that will continue to stick together, because that's the values that we've had right from the start.\n\n\"We'll really enjoy meeting back up again in March for the next tie. We'll obviously see each other a lot before then but it'll be a nice feeling going into March as defending champions.\"\n\nAndy Murray is intending to play in that tie, provided all goes as planned with the birth of his first child, but, should Britain win, he is likely to miss the quarter-finals in July.\n\nThe tie, which could pit Britain against Novak Djokovic's Serbia, is the week after Wimbledon and only two weeks before a packed American hard-court season that includes the Rio Olympics, where Murray will defend his singles title.\n\nThe world No.2 believes the International Tennis Federation, which organises the Davis Cup, and the ATP should do more to ensure scheduling problems can be resolved.\n\nBritain's chance at Davis Cup glory would surely not have been possible had the likes of Roger Federer, Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka played in all the ties in 2015.\n\n\"I do think the format does work very well,\" said Murray. \"The atmosphere [in Ghent] was amazing. We played four ties this year and every one of them was sold out and the atmosphere was really good. I haven't played in any other atmospheres like that throughout the year.\n\n\"It's just the timing of the competition. It would be great if the ATP and the ITF could actually really work together to try to work something out because I think the Davis Cup is a great way of promoting tennis and growing the game and reaching out to different people.\n\n\"I do think if they work together a little bit harder they could make it even better.\"", "Sports still carried 'irreplaceable' Garrett Swasey": "Olympic medalist Nancy Kerrigan reflects on the life of her former training partner Garrett Swasey, the police officer killed in last week's shootings in Colorado Springs. (1:31)\n\nA few minutes before 9 a.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays, Garrett Swasey would walk into the pros' room at the Sertich Ice Center in Colorado Springs in street clothes, open his locker, pull out a pair of battered black skates and tuck his police badge and gun in their place. Then he'd lace up and get ready to guide his 78-year-old student through the 22 steps of the \"Westminster Waltz.\"\n\nMarilyn Roe has skated most of her life and still has goals. Swasey, her part-time ice dancing instructor for the past 16 years, helped her meet them.\n\nGarrett Swasey worked as a police officer for the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs for the past six years. University of Colorado at Colorado Springs via AP\n\nA shoulder problem limits Roe's range of motion in her left arm. She couldn't place it on Swasey's shoulder in the correct position for one of the basic dance holds. Being somewhat of a perfectionist, that bothered her. Swasey would move with her through patterns, adjusting, trying different things. Sometimes he would ask two-time British ice dance world champion and longtime coach Doreen Denny to take his place and lead Roe, then stand back and watch, trying to solve the problem. He always found a way to keep her going.\n\n\"I could hunt everywhere and I couldn't find anyone else who would take that much time and care,\" Roe said.\n\nShe says he is irreplaceable.\n\nSwasey was killed on Nov. 27 after responding to a shooting outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs. He was a 44-year-old native of suburban Boston, a husband and father of two, a church elder, a University of Colorado-Colorado Springs police officer, and the 1992 U.S. junior ice dance champion.\n\nHis death was abrupt and ugly, accompanied by earsplitting gunfire, wailing sirens, shattering glass and frantic radio transmissions from other officers pinned down behind their cars. Two civilians died and another nine, including five police officers, were wounded. Social media erupted with political polemic. A suspect was arrested and charged after a five-hour standoff.\n\nEditor's Picks Kerrigan speaks of friend killed in Colo. shooting Figure skating champion Nancy Kerrigan called Colorado Planned Parenthood shooting victim Garrett Swasey \"one of my best friends\"\n\nSwasey's skating contemporaries prefer to summon a different image set to an upbeat soundtrack from 25 years ago: a boy with a huge, engaging smile that entered the room before the rest of him, a teenager who felt music keenly all the way through his long legs.\n\nThe description of his career path that surfaced in public tributes bridged two ostensibly incongruous concepts, an ice dancer-turned-cop. Yet, as some in the sport maintained this week, why not? Both vocations, performed well, require discipline and steadiness. Both rely on split-second reactions.\n\nHis childhood friend, Nancy Kerrigan, remembers standing perfectly still as her introductory applause faded, waiting for her musical cue, the one moment she would be able to hear a voice apart from the crowd. \"Go, Yuk!\" Swasey would yell, using the nickname he gave her, whose origin she can't pinpoint because they knew each other from when and forever.\n\nKerrigan stood in a noisy airport days later and tried to control a slight tremor in her voice as she reminisced. They'd leave school early so Swasey's father, David, could drive them to practice -- two live wires jostling, joking, juggling homework with ice time. All those shared hours, irretrievable now. She had lost touch with Garrett but not with his parents, who called her last week so she wouldn't hear about his death from strangers.\n\n\"You always think you're going to have more time,\" Kerrigan said.\n\n'More Than Words' ...\n\nGarrett Swasey and ice dancing partner Christine Fowler-Binder won the U.S. junior ice dancing title in 1992. Courtesy U.S. Figure Skating\n\nSwasey's junior partner, Christine Binder-Fowler, can feel him gently tugging her blonde hair into a French braid before they went out on the ice, and hear his assurance, after they finished a forgettable last at the national championships in 1991, that they would come back the next year and win.\n\nAfter the compulsory portion of the 1992 competition, Swasey spiked a fever. In grainy footage of the free dance that clinched their title, his cheekbones appear to have a healthy glow, thanks in part to rouge strategically applied to conceal his pallor. The show had to go on.\n\n\"He was so easy-going, so confident,\" Binder-Fowler said this week from her home in Southern California. \"Sometimes I didn't have it, and he gave it to me.\"\n\nThe two moved to Colorado Springs to train with coach Sandra Hess-Gerathy when Swasey was 17, tagging along with their good friends and future Olympians Peter Breen and Rachel Mayer. Hess-Gerathy assembled a support team for her skaters that included an Air Force Academy strength coach and a mental training coach. Swasey was put on a 5,000-calorie-a-day diet to fill out his slender frame. He earnestly followed orders.\n\nHundreds gathered to honor Garrett Swasey last week during a candlelight vigil at University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images\n\nHess-Gerathy once searched for Swasey when he went missing from practice and found him prone on a training table, moaning audibly after having gorged himself at breakfast. \"He was intelligent and serious and a sponge,\" she said. \"You gave him a task and he would do his utmost.\"\n\nSwasey, who roomed with Breen back then, often noodled on acoustic and electric guitars. \"He played everything from James Taylor to Dream Theater, Jimi Hendrix and old blues guys,\" said Breen, a physical therapist and athletic trainer who works with top skaters in the Detroit area.\n\nOne of Swasey's favorite songs to cover was Extreme's \"More Than Words,\" the mega-hit ballad whose chorus begins:\n\nWhat would you do if my heart was torn in two?\n\nMore than words to show you feel\n\nThat your love for me is real ...\n\nIn a sport that attracts its share of theatrical personalities, Swasey was a self-sufficient, no-drama athlete with a self-deprecating sense of humor, his friends say. But he had no problem channeling sentimental lyrics or expressing ardor on the ice. That served him well as a skater.\n\n\"A lot of guys are technically good, but it's hard to get them to reach down and tap into the emotive part,\" Breen said. \"He was primed for that. That was his gift.\"\n\n'My kid'\n\nGarrett Swasey is survived by his wife, Rachel, daughter Faith and son Elijah. Courtesy of Hope Chapel\n\nSwasey liked to feel useful and he didn't like sitting still, which may be part of the reason he carved time out of a crowded life to help a woman in her 70s move purposefully around the ice at a municipal rink. That, and it kept him connected to his old lyrical self and all the partners who came before.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Roe and Denny met at the Sertich rink at the usual time and talked and cried. Denny has left Swasey's skates, which she said he kept chronically unsharpened, in his locker for now. He helped her coach many older students. \"They all felt like they were 'Dancing with the Stars' with Garrett,\" Denny said.\n\nSwasey worked with Roe in back-to-back 20-minute sessions, for which he charged $20 apiece until a couple of years ago, when Denny pretty much forced him to ask for a $5 raise. Roe, the wife of a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who has no children of her own, called him \"my kid.\" On occasion, when her constant self-critique got to him, Swasey would sass her, saying \"Shut up and skate.\"\n\nHe gave her updates on his son's football and his daughter's artwork. She and her husband had dinner with him. Roe always told Swasey to be careful. He always told her he'd see her next week. In all those years, it didn't occur to Roe to get a snapshot taken with him. She'll have to take comfort in muscle memory.\n\n\"I'm having a hard time right now,\" Roe said softly. \"I just really enjoyed my lessons.\"", "Rapid Reaction: Denver Broncos 20, Cincinnati Bengals 17 (OT)": "DENVER -- In his sixth start, Denver Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler had to lead two game-winning drives.\n\nIt looked as if Osweiler had helped the Broncos to a victory, and playoff berth, in regulation. But Brandon McManus missed what would have been the winning field goal as time expired. McManus redeemed himself on the opening drive in overtime, hitting a 37-yard field goal that eventually gave the Broncos a 20-17 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\n\"Sometimes that\u2019s just how the game goes,\" Osweiler said of the missed field goal. \"But our team has a lot of special guys on it, and those guys are willing to fight for sometimes 60-plus minutes. We have had to do that couple of times this year. It\u2019s just a heck of a team effort, great win in front of the best fans in the world.\"\n\nAfter a shaky first half, the rejuvenated Broncos put together a touchdown drive to open the third quarter and scored again early in the fourth to formally insert themselves into the playoff field. With a win over the San Diego Chargers on Sunday in the regular-season finale, the Broncos will clinch their fifth consecutive AFC West title.\n\nBut for a long stretch on a frigid night, it all looked like an impossible dream. The Broncos were overpowered on virtually every front in the opening half, as the Bengals had a 14-0 lead with just over four minutes gone in the second quarter. It was so bad that the Broncos had put together just 29 yards of offense prior to a 60-yard drive that ended in a field goal just before halftime.\n\n\"We flip-flopped things. You know last week we started fast, finished slow,\" Osweiler said. \"We just thought we would do the opposite this week.\"\n\nOsweiler finished 27-of-39 for 299 yards and a touchdown. He is now 4-2 as a starter and has wins over the New England Patriots and Bengals in overtime.\n\nEmmanuel Sanders' touchdown reception helped revitalize the Broncos' hopes in Monday night's victory. Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n\nWhat were they thinking?: After a weekend when a coin flip was one of the biggest headlines following the New York Jets' overtime win over the Patriots, referee Ed Hochuli had a bobble Monday night. After the Broncos won the toss and elected to defer until the second half, Hochuli said \u201cCincinnati\" won the toss and would kick off. The players, after a slight hesitation, headed in the proper directions anyway.\n\nOne reason to get excited: There are times when Osweiler looks comfortable in the \u201cso-called\u2019\u2019 Peyton Manning offense, in the shotgun and with a three-wide receiver set. The Broncos opened the second half with an 11-play touchdown drive. All 11 plays were run with three-wide receiver sets, and Osweiler was in the shotgun on eight of the plays. It bodes well for a team that hasn\u2019t always stressed opposing defenses in pass-first situations.\n\nOne reason to panic: Teams that can\u2019t consistently win at the point of attack on offense don\u2019t advance in the playoffs. The Bengals simply overwhelmed the Broncos at the point of attack in the first half Monday night. Over and over again, the Bengals rushed off the edge and swarmed the middle; Osweiler was sacked twice in the first half and hit on several more plays. And the Broncos also rushed for just 32 yards in the first half. With Denver trying to work around injuries on the offensive line, defenses -- including Cincinnati's -- have refined their approach against the Broncos' running attack.\n\nFantasy watch: Emmanuel Sanders said he signed with the Broncos to show what he could do as a top-tier option in their passing game. With 67 yards receiving in the first half on Monday, he topped 1,000 yards for the second consecutive season. While he won\u2019t lead the team in catches or yards this season -- Demaryius Thomas will -- Sanders has been the team\u2019s most consistent option at wideout and might have led all categories if not for shoulder and ankle injuries.\n\nOuch: The Broncos had significant question marks at safety last week. Darian Stewart didn\u2019t practice until the end of the week because of a hamstring injury, while T.J. Ward, who had missed the previous three games with a left ankle injury, had been limited through the week. Ward left the game in the fourth quarter after it appeared he had re-injured his ankle. Osweiler came in with a sore left shoulder and appeared to suffer a left elbow injury in the first half. Linebacker Brandon Marshall left the game in the fourth quarter with an ankle injury, C.J. Anderson suffered a back injury on a fourth-quarter play when he fumbled, Sanders limped off after an incomplete pass in overtime and tight end Owen Daniels left the game after taking a big hit in overtime.", "NHL -- Boston Bruins president Cam Neely talks about Winter Classic, concussions": "BOSTON -- As the Boston Bruins prepare to host the Montreal Canadiens in the 2016 Winter Classic on New Year's Day at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Hall of Famer Cam Neely is dusting off his skates, getting them sharpened -- and loading up on Advil.\n\nThe last time No. 8 played was during the alumni game at the 2010 Winter Classic at Fenway Park.

Although I was born in British Columbia, six months later, my dad was transferred. He was in the Air Force, so he got transferred to a base outside of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and I spent a lot of hours on a backyard rink. I've got to tell you, when you hear all the players say, 'Oh, it brings you back to your childhood,' it absolutely does. When I played in the alumni game at the Winter Classic, it brought back all those memories of being outside all day until your feet were frozen off.\n\nIt's a big deal. I'm thrilled we're able to host it again. A different venue gives us more opportunity to do more things around the stadium because of the space, especially with youth hockey.

My knees just bark at me too much now.\n\nJM: You mentioned youth hockey, and numbers are growing in the U.S, so how proud are you with the organization's dedication to the sport at the grassroots levels?\n\nCN: It's important for us to do that as an organization. As everybody knows, there's great college hockey, not just in Massachusetts, but in Rhode Island, where Providence [College] had a great year last year [winning a national championship], so it's important for us to help grow the game, grow the sport. We're trying to introduce 1,000 kids a year into hockey. That's something we started last year and you hope the kids continue it, but we offer them starter kits to get going.\n\nIt's our duty to grow the sport here. Obviously I'm biased, but whether you play it or watch it, it's one of the better sports, especially as a spectator sport because of the action, but people have to understand the game to be able to sit and watch it. That's a challenge, so the more we can introduce people to the game, and even the cartoon series we're doing, it's geared toward kids so they can sit down and maybe learn something about the game.\n\nJM: Speaking of growing the game, what are your thoughts about expansion in the NHL?\n\nCN: Well, you want it to be right. As far as enough players, I guess it could be debatable. Can an expansion team be a competitive team early in its expansion? It's hard to say. It has to be right and that's why the league has taken its time because they want to make sure it's right. It would be nice to have balanced conferences, I can say that.\n\nJM: What was it like having that conversation with Bruins owner Jeremy Jacobs about all the offseason changes, and telling him he had to be patient with the new plans?\n\nCN: First of all, [hopefully he] had the confidence that maybe these guys know what they're talking about, or at least hopefully about that. You look at the core group, we still have a world-class goalie [Tuukka Rask], still have a real difficult shutdown defenseman in [Zdeno] Chara, we still have [David] Krejci, [Patrice] Bergeron, [Brad] Marchand and we've seen Loui [Eriksson] improve again last year, so we still felt we had really good components to a good team. The amount of times I've talked to Mr. Jacobs is on a regular basis, so it's not necessarily just one two-hour conversation; it's conversations over a period of time.\n\nJM: From the start of the 2015-16 season until now, what has impressed you most about this team?\n\nCN: That was part of the conversation [with Mr. Jacobs] that we have a lot of new faces getting adjusted to a new coach, the coach adjusting to some of the things that [GM] Don [Sweeney] wanted changed, the way we played, and not really being able to get our team together right until the end of camp, and even then we had [Dennis] Seidenberg out. So, knowing that even though you got all these exhibition games, we were still auditioning backup goalies, we're looking at what young kids could make an impact and we had more openings than prior to past years when we knew what your team was going to be. There was more competition than we've had in the past.\n\nWe knew it was going to be a little rocky to start, but we didn't think it was going to be like that. But I really give the players and the coaching staff credit of sticking to the plan and saying, 'OK, let's keep working.' There's a difference between coaching and teaching -- you've got to do both. So, there was more teaching, especially with the new bodies, and it takes time for players to understand what the coaching staff is looking for, but having the patience to go through that even though it was pretty ugly.\n\nJM: How do you think coach Claude Julien has done?\n\nCN: Claude and his staff have done a really good job. It's not easy having a number of new faces. We've got guys that hadn't played in the NHL, or hadn't played much in the NHL before, so bringing those guys along, there's a coaching part and a teaching part, and they've done a really good job of teaching and that needs to continue to go on. We've always liked what he's brought to this organization. There's no gray area when he deals with the players. They know he's a straightforward coach and he'll tell it like it is, and a lot of it is behind closed doors, which I think it should be as a coach.\n\nThen there's adapting to a new GM, but the conversations that Don and Claude have, I know Don is very active and very involved, and that's his working style. Don's constantly talking to Claude and our other coaches, which is important that everybody understands what we're trying to accomplish here.\n\nJM: How has Don Sweeney done so far in his first season as GM?\n\nCN: He's done a great job so far. It took a lot for him to do what he did in and around the draft, and he wasn't afraid to do it. One of the things about having Don in the organization for as long as he has been, he's seen some things that maybe did not go the way we would have liked to have gone. He didn't have to educate himself on the players, the staff; he knew who they were and what they were about. He had a good understanding of what was in our system, so all those things were a benefit for Don.\n\nI give him credit because the way we started, there was no panic in him at all, even though it wasn't easy for him with the comments that were flying around in and around the draft, and then throughout the offseason and obviously the way we started. There was no panic in Don. You wouldn't have known he was as frustrated as he was with how things started, but he stuck with his vision and made sure everyone knew we were deviating from the plan. We said it was going to be a little rocky and bumpy and we'll pull out of it. We still have a long way to go, but to have the stretch that we've gone on after the start, and keep climbing the ladder has been refreshing.\n\nJM: What or who can make this team better?\n\nCN: We're still trying to find our way with consistency. Claude's done a really good job of juggling lines when he feels he needs to, and that's something he's done a good job at. If he sees someone who's really not going they way he would like, he's quick to change to give us a spark. Hopefully some of the young guys continue to improve. With Dennis Seidenberg, think about how much hockey he has missed, and then the long offseason, he's still rounding his game into form, and as the games tick off, he'll continue to improve. Colin Miller, this guy has been a really good player for us, and he only stands to get better.\n\nJM: It's still a couple of months away, but how active will you be before the trade deadline?\n\nCN: Listen, we talk on a regular basis how to improve our club. If there's a deal to be made that's going to help our club, we'll do it. We've got more assets now than we've had in a long time. We have some flexibility with the cap that we haven't had the luxury of in awhile, so hopefully with those two things, it gives us more opportunity -- although it's not easy to make deals.\n\nJM: Who was the best player you saw play?\n\nCN: My first three years in Vancouver, I saw a lot of Wayne Gretzky and that team. I saw him do some things, more on the playmaking side, that I had never seen before. I don't recall [Bobby Orr], watching him. Obviously, I saw the highlights, but the way he transformed defensemen was unlike any player in the game. But just from what Gretzky did and how he did it and what he could do, so watching him at 18, 19 [years old] from prime seats was pretty amazing.\n\nPlayoff meetings with the Edmonton Oilers didn't turn out well for Cam Neely and the Bruins. Bruce Bennett Studios/Getty Images\n\nJM: How good were those Edmonton Oilers teams that beat the Bruins in the 1988 and 1990?\n\nCN: Well, '88 I really felt we weren't in that class. In '90, I thought we had a chance -- I really did. That triple-overtime game really sent the momentum the other way, but I really felt we had a good opportunity there. That kid line -- the secondary scoring -- really made a big impact on that team. If you have another layer like that, it makes a big difference. We had that [against the Vancouver Canucks] in 2011.\n\nJM: Harry Sinden spent 17 seasons as team president. How long do you envision having this role?\n\nCN: As long as I keep doing a job that people are happy with, and the fire still burns, and the passion is still there. For me, the passion has to be there. That's the most important thing, whether you're a player or in a position like this, is the passion to want to win and the hate-to-lose has to be there.\n\nJM: Is it there?\n\nCN: Always.\n\nJM: The topic of concussions has been at the forefront of sports at every level. How has it changed since your playing days?\n\nCN: Well, the education level has changed dramatically. There's so much more information how to identify it properly, or better. Then what you do after the fact, so it's more really about the information and then that information being shared.\n\nJM: How is that awareness going in the right direction?\n\nCN: The players are the ones, you can set all the rules you want, but if the players don't follow them, there's not much you can do other than suspend them. The players have done a good job. You're seeing less and less of these blindside hits, boarding or hits from behind. The players' safety department has done a really good job of educating the players before each season -- here's what we're looking for and here's what you need to avoid. They're doing a really good job with that.\n\nJM: Thanks for your time, Cam, and enjoy the Winter Classic.", "The Power Of Serena Williams' Sports Illustrated Cover": "The Power Of Serena Williams' Sports Illustrated Cover\n\nYu Tsai for Sports Illustrated The art direction behind Serena Williams' Sports Illustrated cover caused just as much controversy as her selection for SI's 2015 Sportsperson of the Year.\n\nWhen Serena Williams' name is mentioned, controversy is sure to follow. She is arguably the greatest tennis player in the history of the sport, yet she has scores of detractors who will focus on what her body looks like, find fault with her domineering demeanor on the court or attack the grunts she makes as she pounds out unreturnable serves at 120 mph. Even her offseason, off-court moves are scrutinized. This week proved no different when Sports Illustrated named Williams its 2015 Sportsperson of the Year.\n\nThe announcement stirred the pot for two reasons, one of them being the majority of Sports Illustrated readers voted Triple Crown winner American Pharoah as their choice for Sportsperson of the Year. Despite Williams' career year -- three Grand Slam titles, winning 26 of 27 Grand Slam matches, and an overall record of 53-3 -- she ranked tenth out of eleven on the readers' poll. By now, the outcry from Pharoah fans has been documented ad nauseam. No need to rehash the absurdity of that debate.\n\nThe other reason the announcement had the Twitter streets talking was the creative direction of SI's cover, which features Williams, the first solo woman to appear on the front of the highly coveted issue since track-and-field athlete Mary Decker in 1983.\n\nThe cover features Williams dressed in an all-black lace bodysuit and patent leather power pumps, perched on a gold, ornate throne. Those who recognize Williams as Queen of the Court immediately see the image as an appropriate nod to her ruling the tennis world. However, not everyone is bowing down in praise of the cover. While some say it's extremely powerful, others say it's either too sexy. My point of view is a bit more simplistic and sounds a little something like this, \"Yes, yes, and yaaassss!\" Especially after Sports Illustrated revealed, \"The cover was Serena's idea, to express her own ideal of femininity, strength and power.\"\n\n\n\nThe cover was Serena's idea, to express her own ideal of femininity, strength and power https://t.co/XVCpNmW5FD pic.twitter.com/gRr362mruO \u2014 Sports Illustrated (@SInow) December 15, 2015\n\nLooking at the cover and the attention it garnered, I say mission accomplished, Serena. While the cover, absent of any tennis props, not so subtly reminds us she is not defined by the sport, it also sends a more important message: She understands it is possible for women to simultaneously possess sex appeal and power. There is an inherent power in owning and self-defining your sexuality. It is not an either/or thing, but an and/both non-mutually exclusive thing. Serena is a strong, skilled, competent and self-respecting woman, in control of her image and all that it entails. Not only is there nothing wrong with that, but it's in fact highly empowering. It's a boss move.\n\nSerena has never fit the mold tennis, or the sports world, tried to create for her so why would she start now? In her WIRED magazine essay, she publicly identified herself as a black woman \"in a sport that wasn't really meant for black people.\" Her self-awareness, courage to speak out and be as bad as she wants to be is a positive shift toward achieving equal representation on a race and gender front. This isn't just a magazine cover. It's progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor centuries, black women have been demeaned and taught to value themselves less than women of any other race. Williams, specifically, has bore the brunt of centuries-old scrutiny regarding her body composition and race. And finally, after 20 years of consistency, and over 250 consecutive weeks ranked No. 1 in the world, Williams has earned the right to call the shots, both literally and figuratively. Far from an unseasoned rookie, Williams has gained the opportunity to control her image and how she'd like to be portrayed on one of the most meaningful magazine covers of her iconic career. Williams going against the grain and portraying herself as a feminine, strong and powerful woman, void of tennis props, is a major victory for all women who work tirelessly, and often thanklessly, to crash through glass ceilings in any industry.\n\nHer success. Her cover. Her body. Her choice. Our win.\n\nShana Renee is the founder and editor-in-chief of All Sports Everything and a passionate New York Jets, Knicks and Yankees fan.

Diack wanted to finance opposition against Senegal's then-president Abdoulaye Wade.\n\nThe transcript reported by Le Monde said: \"I told him that to win the elections, I needed about 1.5 million euros. He said to me, 'We'll try to find it, no problem'.\n\n\"At that time there was these problems of suspending Russian athletes a few months ahead of the world championships in Russia. We came to an agreement. Russia paid. Balakhnichev organised all of that.\"\n\nBalakhnichev denied to Le Monde having had such a conversation with Diack.\n\nThe IAAF ethics commission on Friday concluded a three-day hearing into Balakhnichev, Diack's son Papa Massata Diack, former IAAF anti-doping director Gabriel Dolle; and the Russian federation's former chief coach for long-distance athletes, Alexei Melnikov.\n\nThe officials faced disciplinary hearings on charges that they covered up doping offences. All four are charged with various breaches of the IAAF's code of ethics and could face lifetime bans - a decision is expected in early January.\n\nThe IAAF charges involve Russian runner Liliya Shobukhova, the former London marathon winner who turned whistleblower for the World Anti-Doping Agency earlier this year, and money she paid to have her doping violations covered up.\n\nAccording to testimony she has given, Shobukhova paid more than $600,000 (\u00a3435,000) for violations to be covered up so that she was not suspended.\n\nThe IAAF has banned Russia from international competition after a report by the World Anti Doping Agency's independent commission, headed by Dick Pound, who is due to release the second part of his findings on January 14.", "Toni Nadal believes we'll see return of vintage Rafa Nadal": "By his standards, Rafael Nadal's season was a disappointment. He failed to reach a Grand Slam final and experienced long periods of self-doubt, even losing trust in his lethal forehand.\n\nBut was this just an aberration? Will the Nadal who won 14 Grand Slam titles return in 2016?\n\nRecently, his uncle and longtime coach, Toni Nadal, spoke with ESPN.com.\n\nWhat has changed for Rafa? What can he do to raise his level?\n\n\"First of all, and this is the most important thing, is the tranquility. Rafael is much more comfortable on the court now. And in this moment, he thinks about what he needs to do, and then when he gets on the court that is what he does. For many months this year, he was thinking about what he wanted to do, about this or that, but then when he came on the court, he couldn't do it. Now he can do it, and that's good. It gives him the possibility to play well.\"\n\nHow frustrating has this season been for you and Nadal?\n\nFor the first time since 2004, Rafael Nadal failed to win a Grand Slam title. Aurelien Meunier/Getty Images\n\n\"For me, it hasn't been difficult because I know that in life things don't always go as I want, and how Rafael wants. I know that it's not the case that just because you want to do something, that it's going to happen. In life, things don't always go the way you want, or in the direction you want, and tennis is the same, it's not special. So it's OK, because we can accept that sometimes we have good seasons and sometimes we have bad seasons. We have good tournaments and we have bad tournaments.\"\n\nWith victories against Stan Wawrinka and Andy Murray in the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals, are you happy with the direction Nadal is going?\n\n\"Maybe. But he also wasn't so far away from beating Roger Federer in an indoor court in Basel [recently] when Roger was playing very well. And he has beaten some good players recently. For us, the victory over Andy Murray in London was very important because Murray is the No. 2 in the world and a very good player. I think Rafael during the last two months has played so much better than earlier in the season.\"\n\nWill Rafael go back to winning Grand Slams in 2016?\n\n\"Yes. I couldn't do this work if I thought that he couldn't win more Grand Slams. No, no, no, I think that he can win more Grand Slams. He can win the Australian Open in January. And he can win Wimbledon, too. The last few years, Rafael arrives at Wimbledon and he loses early, and very fast. And, in Roland Garros, for sure, Rafael can win. In tennis, you need confidence to do things. It's impossible to do anything without confidence. You can't win any good tournaments if you think you cannot and you don't believe.\"\n\nDo you think that Rafa can equal and then surpass Federer's 17 Grand Slam titles?\n\n\"I don't know. I will wait until 2016 starts before I think about that, but I know that Rafael can improve and that he can play well and play to a high level.\"\n\nWho had the better season, Novak Djokovic or Serena Williams?\n\n\"I think Djokovic, but Serena had a great year, too, as she also won three Grand Slams. Maybe Djokovic as he made the final of the other one [Roland Garros] and Serena lost in the semifinal of the one she didn't win [the US Open]. Sometimes this season it was impossible for anyone to beat Djokovic. With Serena, it was a little less impossible for her opponents.\"\n\nWhat does Rafa have to do to challenge Djokovic in 2016?\n\n\"What he tries to do every day on court, which is to play more aggressively from the baseline, and to go into the net when he can, and to improve his serve.\"", "NHL -- A few under-the-radar moves have paid off big time so far": "Barry Melrose selects the New York Islanders' line of Matt Martin, Casey Cizikas and Cal Clutterbuck as the most important role players in the league right now. (1:13)\n\nRosters typically take shape between the first few days of free agency and the final cuts of training camp. Whip up some line combinations and, voil\u00e0, you've got your team.\n\nIf only it was that easy.\n\n\"I think everybody thinks their team is all set until you lose the first few games at the start of the season,\" said Mike Smith, the former general manager of the Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets.\n\nWhether inspired by injuries, poor play or little more than a hunch, general managers are inevitably forced to get creative in restructuring their team as the season rolls along. And in a few special cases, those early-season risks have yielded unexpected rewards.\n\nGMs have typically made these tweaks through trade. But with only one player-for-player swap so far this season, that is no longer the case.\n\n\"The cap plays a big part in that. Either certain players are making too much money or there is too much term,\" said Smith. \"There seem to be more players picked up on waivers now than before.\"\n\nBetween waiver claims, professional tryout agreements and minor league call-ups, GMs can make low-risk, off-the-radar roster moves. For a few teams and players, those moves have so far paid big dividends.\n\nLee Stempniak, New Jersey Devils: Perhaps no player epitomizes New Jersey's surprise season quite like Stempniak. The Devils signed the journeyman wing to a pro tryout the day before veterans reported to training camp. After joining his fifth team in three seasons, the tempered expectations in New Jersey worked just fine for Stempniak.\n\nThe Devils are in the thick of the Eastern Conference race for a playoff spot and Stempniak was third on the Devils in points. Most surprising has been Stempniak's help with the man advantage. Just 35 games into the season, his nine power-play points and 94:11 in power-play ice time already eclipsed his totals for all of last season, which he split between the New York Rangers and Jets.\n\nPaul Byron, Montreal Canadiens: Byron was placed on waivers by the Calgary Flames and claimed by the Canadiens the day before they opened the season. He then languished as a healthy scratch for almost a month before finally getting a shot on the Habs' fourth line. Since then, he's played in a variety of situations, including a few shifts on the team's first line alongside captain Max Pacioretty and Tomas Plekanec.\n\nBut it's on the penalty kill where Byron has excelled. The diminutive speedster scored shorthanded in his second game of the season and entered the Christmas holiday week tied for second in the NHL with three shorties. While the Canadiens have struggled in December, Byron's three goals in the month lead the team.\n\nMattias Janmark, Dallas Stars: Considered a throw-in in the 2015 trade deadline deal that sent Erik Cole to the Detroit Red Wings, the 23-year-old Swede was expected to return to Europe before the season even began. But the third-round pick in 2013 defied expectations, made the team and quickly established himself as an important depth forward.\n\nJanmark adapted quickly to the smaller North American ice surface and scored a goal on the first shot of his first NHL shift -- it was the game winner, no less. His eight goals this season have been a welcome surprise for the Stars, but the rookie has truly thrived on a line with veteran Jason Spezza, scoring four goals in December.\n\nLandon Ferraro, Boston Bruins: Ferraro hoped to enjoy his breakout season with the Red Wings. Those plans changed when the 24-year-old forward was placed on waivers after going pointless in his first 10 games of the season with Detroit. He's practically been a different player since the Bruins claimed him.\n\nAfter collecting one point in 17 career games with Detroit, Ferraro provided an instant spark for the Bruins, scoring seven points in 14 games. That scoring touch earned him a series of promotions, eventually culminating in a spot on the Bruins' top line with Patrice Bergeron and Brad Marchand. Perhaps most telling, the Bruins are 9-1-3 since claiming Ferraro on Nov. 22.\n\nBrayden McNabb, Los Angeles Kings: McNabb wasn't exactly an unknown commodity entering the season. He even enjoyed a strong first season in Los Angeles last year while mostly playing limited minutes. But a once-vaunted Kings blue line was forced to rebuild after losing Willie Mitchell and Andrej Sekera to free agency, Slava Voynov to off-ice legal trouble, Robyn Regehr to retirement and Matt Greene to a series of injuries.\n\nThere was no indication McNabb would be a big part of that restructuring. Especially when the Buffalo Sabres draft pick was a healthy scratch on opening night. But McNabb has seen his minutes increase as the season has gone on, particularly at even strength and on the penalty kill. After earning the trust of Kings coach Darryl Sutter, McNabb earned the coveted spot beside superstar Drew Doughty on the team's top defensive pair.\n\nBrett Pesce, Carolina Hurricanes: After taking a defenseman with three of their past four first-round picks, Carolina has amassed a nice collection of young blue-line talent. Of course, the Hurricanes never really considered Pesce part of that group entering this season.\n\nAfter starting the season in the American Hockey League, Pesce got an early-season call to the Hurricanes and has surpassed all expectations. The hope was Pesce could provide responsible play in his own end, but the University of New Hampshire product has also added nine points in his first 27 NHL games, which ranks fourth among rookie defensemen.", "Has Draymond Green passed LeBron James?": "As I mentioned last week, many (most?) fantasy hoopsters are paying only cursory attention to their squads during the holiday season. That gives the real fantasy hoops junkie an advantage at this time of the year, because we can work the waiver wire and think through changes in the fantasy landscape that others aren't paying attention to.\n\nInjuries have played a big role this week, as Blake Griffin and Eric Bledsoe were hurt and are expected to miss significant action. Who will benefit from their absences? Al Jefferson returned from a lengthy absence due to his own malady. How will he fare? How will Ish Smith fare after being traded to the Philadelphia 76ers? How about a pair of elite players; has Draymond Green passed LeBron James as a fantasy star?\n\nDon't worry; I have the answers for you.\n\nEach Monday this season, I'll tip the week off by posting and seeking answers to five key questions, thus \"The Starting Five.\"\n\nThis week's contributors are ESPN Fantasy analyst John Cregan, ESPN NBA Insider Bradford Doolittle and yours truly.\n\nDraymond Green (10.71) and LeBron James (10.70) are essentially tied on the ESPN Player Rater based on per-game averages. Who would you rather have for the rest of the season?\n\nCregan: In a non-turnover league, I'd still give LeBron James an ever-so-slight edge in terms of season-long value. When choosing between two players of near-equivalent value, I tend to favor the player with the higher usage rate. Go with the player who will have the ball in his hands more. At present, LeBron is posting a career-high usage rate of 32.9. That will drop slightly with Kyrie Irving's return. But if your league factors in turnovers, Draymond Green and LeBron have equivalent value. I don't anticipate a wild shift one way or the other... perhaps an ever-so-slight downgrade for LeBron now that Irving is back. But in a non-turnover league, it boils down to need. If I need blocks, boards and 3s, I choose Green. If I need scoring and field goal percentage, LeBron. (By the way, a major strike against LeBron at present is 3-point shooting. He's still mired in a slump that goes back to last season, and is hitting a career-low 25 percent from deep.) Editor's Picks Fantasy NBA cheat sheet: Surprises and slumps We round up our best Insider basketball tips from the past week to help you with your fantasy basketball lineups, including slumping rookies and surprisingly productive performers.\n\nKaiser: Must-add fantasy NBA players Joe Kaiser provides his latest installment of a series looking at undervalued and overvalued players, led by Julius Randle and Taj Gibson. 1 Related\n\nDoolittle: There's about 12.3 NBA seasons' worth of evidence to suggest that James is the better play for now, the rest of the season and the rest of eternity. James' lackluster 3-point shooting accounts for the identical Rater score, but it would be shocking if he remained at 25 percent for the rest of the season. He's a 34 percent shooter for his career, and you're better off considering that as his baseline rather than his season-to-date numbers as they stand.\n\nCarpenter: In my last rankings, I had James at No. 7 and Green at No. 15, based on roto formats. However, the gap between them has been shrinking and will continue to diminish if Green keeps on scoring in the upper teens. I think you can make a good case that Green is the better fantasy player, partly due to untapped upside and age being on his side. However, I give extra weight to high-volume scorers in fantasy, and James is currently outpacing Green by a wide margin: 25.8 PPG, 48.7 field goal percentage, 20.1 FGA for James and 14.6 PPG, 46.1 field goal percentage and 11.4 FGA for Green. That volume extends his lead over Green more in points systems.\n\nWith Blake Griffin expected to miss at least two weeks due to a partially torn quadriceps tendon, who on the Los Angeles Clippers will benefit most from his absence? Is there a Clippers player on waivers who is worth picking up?\n\nCregan: If there ever was going to be a time for Josh Smith to step up and reclaim some semblance of fantasy value, this would be it. Smith registered a five-minute flameout Saturday, but when you couple Smith's ability to block shots with his lack of any sense of shame in hoisting ill-advised 3-pointers ... he's the Clipper with upside in a Griffin-less rotation. Luc Richard Mbah a Moute should also see a minutes boost, but he is a defense-first player who won't contribute much outside of the dreaded \"intangibles\" category. At present, I wouldn't add Smith until he logs 20-25 minutes a game.\n\nDoolittle: I'd say Paul Pierce. While Doc Rivers has been carefully doling out minutes for Pierce so far, he can afford to extend him for a couple of weeks. Josh Smith is the obvious positional replacement, but starting him at forward next to Luc Richard Mbah a Moute is a non-starter. It's really a choice between Pierce-Mbah a Moute and Pierce-Smith, and the possession distribution among the Clippers' starters works better with the former.\n\nCarpenter: Josh Smith should have his moments in up-tempo games against weak frontcourts and Paul Pierce should have his moments in slow-paced games, but with Smoove's hideous percentages and Pierce's lack of production outside of scoring and 3s, neither should be a reliable fantasy option in Griffin's absence. I can't recommend either as waiver additions in standard-sized leagues. I think the real winner here will be J.J. Redick. Someone is going to have to replace some of Griffin's 23.2 PPG, and Redick is the Clippers' third-best scoring option after Griffin and Chris Paul. He came through with 25 points Saturday sans Griffin, and I expect him to average 20-plus PPG and three 3-pointers per game while Griffin is down.\n\nEric Bledsoe will be out for a while due to injury. How should fantasy owners react? Noah Graham/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nEric Bledsoe sprained his knee Saturday evening. How will his absence impact the fantasy production of his teammates? Is there a Suns player you would recommend adding off of waivers?\n\nCregan: Devin Booker is the immediate play. The 19-year-old rookie canned three 3-pointers in his first extended relief appearance. The problem with Booker is that he'll have to register a dent in steals and/or assists to rise above specialist status. The Suns have some other young backcourt upside that could get an opportunity if Booker struggles. Both Sonny Weems and Archie Goodwin have flashed fantasy potential and could shine within Phoenix's rapidly cratering seasonal expectations.\n\nDoolittle: Brandon Knight should dominate the ball with Bledsoe out and given his ability to get into the paint, you want shooters around him to kick to. Jeff Hornacek will likely stick with P.J. Tucker at the three, as with Bledsoe out he's going to need the perimeter defense. So almost by default, it's got to be Devin Booker, as long as he can provide a semblance of competent defense. That could be exciting. Booker is shooting more than 50 percent from deep and averaging 15 points per 36 minutes. His floor game is lacking, but maybe he can expand that with a full-time role.\n\nCarpenter: Obviously, Brandon Knight will be the biggest beneficiary, though the extra workload will bring more risk of injury to him. Both Knight and Bledsoe have lengthy injury histories, which we must factor into determining their values going forward. I remain very nervous about both. Devin Booker is worth adding off waivers to see if he can settle in as a viable scorer and 3-point contributor. Beyond him, I'll wait to see how the box scores flesh out during the next couple of games before targeting anyone else.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers acquired Ish Smith last week, and he racked up 14 points and five dimes in his debut Saturday. He is available in more than 60 percent of ESPN leagues. Should he be added to fantasy rosters?\n\nCregan: By way of sheer attrition, the statistical ghost ship known as the Philadelphia 76ers tends to land a couple of obscurities on the fantasy radar every season. Why not Ish Smith? Smith's per-36 minute numbers for the season: 14.1 PTS, 8.8 AST, 5.2 REB, 1.4 STL, 0.6 3PT. I'd add him in any medium-to-deep league where I needed guard help. He's not the greatest 3-point shooter, but contributes everywhere else you need a point guard to chip in. Smith's statistical secret sauce, however, is a small forward-esque rebound rate. Don't discount new hire Mike D'Antoni's influence. Smith was brought in to help stabilize the vacuum that is Philadelphia's point guard position. D'Antoni has a history of manufacturing fantasy-friendly point guards out of the NBA equivalent of scrap metal and duct tape.\n\nDoolittle: Given the alternatives, I don't see any way Smith doesn't get big minutes. He can't shoot, but he's been proficient in every other category the last couple of years on a per-minute basis. If you can absorb some inefficient shooting, he's a great add.\n\nCarpenter: I think he should be added in all formats just to see what happens. He has two key factors going in his favor. First, we know he can rack up stats -- he averaged 12.4 PPG and 8.4 APG in 31.2 MPG in November with the New Orleans Pelicans. Second, the Sixers wanted him badly enough to trade for him and release Tony Wroten. We can infer that they want him to take control of the starting point guard job, which means he has a shot at playing 35 minutes per game. That makes him a pretty intriguing pickup to see if things really click.\n\nAl Jefferson returned from an 11-game absence Saturday and mustered only two points and four boards in 18 minutes. On the season, he is averaging only 13.1 PPG and 6.2 RPG. What are your expectations for him the rest of the way?\n\nCregan: Ninth-round value. A realistic estimate would be around 15 points, 8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks. The frontcourt dynamic in Charlotte has shifted, and the upside is tilting towards Cody Zeller and Frank Kaminsky.\n\nDoolittle: His per-minute numbers aren't what they used to be, but this year's performance more or less mirrors last year's by this scale. Unfortunately, his minutes have dipped (about 25 per game). The Hornets have played so well offensively without Jefferson on the floor that it wouldn't be a surprise to see his minutes fall even further. It's not like he's a plus on the defensive end.\n\nCarpenter: Before he returned to the hardwood, I had him ranked at No. 102 for the rest of the season, which I think was rather generous for a player who has been on the downward slide for quite some time. Furthermore, I've never been a fan of his fantasy game, since he hasn't been much of a shot-blocker and he sports a rough free throw percentage. Still, he has more upside than most of the other players I rank below 100; thus his standing. However, I don't expect a big turnaround and won't be surprised if he sinks down my rankings and the Player Rater the rest of the way. He is not a player I want on my fantasy squads.", "Kawhi Leonard rises in rest-of-season rankings": "Every other week this season, I will publish my top-130 fantasy basketball rankings for the remainder of the season.\n\nThese rankings are based on season-long rotisserie formats. That means that players who excel in one or two categories will be ranked higher and those who fail miserably in percentages will be ranked lower than they would be in a points system.\n\nSo, a 3-point specialist like Kyle Korver gets a bump, while a young star like Andre Drummond, who misses a ton of free throws, sinks. You will want to adjust accordingly based on your league's scoring system.\n\nThese rankings are forward-looking. If you want to know where players stand based on what they have done thus far this season, check out the ESPN Player Rater.\n\nMy goal here is to give you an idea of how much I value each player for the rest of the 2015-16 campaign. In its most basic sense, I am asking myself if I would rather have Player X over Player Y through April. If so, I rank him higher.\n\nAs always, I value your feedback, so feel free to hit me up @AtomicHarpua.\n\nMy top five went unchanged, but Kawhi Leonard has moved up to No. 6, skipping over DeMarcus Cousins and Paul George. His consistent play and amazing percentages can't be overlooked, especially compared to Cousins and George, who not only have been scuffling lately but don't have percentages that compare to Leonard. I still can't stop imagining what sort of numbers he would produce if he were on a wide-open team like the Golden State Warriors. Surely, he would be a top-two or -three option.\n\nAlthough I still believe in Kristaps Porzingis, he has been playing so poorly of late that I had to drop him about 10 spots. I do think this is just a bump in the road and he will get off the schneid and have a big second half of the season, but any rookie taking on that much of a workload carries with him tons of risk. With that in mind, I dropped him behind several veterans who have established high-volume roles and will carry far less risk.\n\nBrandon Knight also dropped about 10 spots. I never really understood why the Phoenix Suns wanted Eric Bledsoe paired with Knight in their backcourt, since they have redundant skillsets. Bledsoe is the better player, though, so Knight has taken on a secondary role -- and even less than that as a reserve -- which caps his upside. Add to that a propensity for getting hurt, and he slips in my rankings.\n\nEditor's Picks Cregan: Klay Thompson is not top fantasy SG John Cregan looks at Klay Thompson's claim that he's the best shooting guard in the NBA as it relates to fantasy.\n\nKaiser: Drop these fantasy NBA players Joe Kaiser provides his latest installment of a series looking at undervalued and overvalued players, led by Patrick Beverley and Nikola Mirotic.\n\nFantasy basketball cheat sheet: Kyrie returns What does Kyrie Irving's return mean for fantasy owners? Is Andrew Wiggins too one-dimensional to keep? We put all of our best Insider tips in one place to help you find an edge. 2 Related\n\nSince my last rankings two weeks ago, Klay Thompson found his shot, and the Golden State Warriors decided to feed him the ball. He carries top-10 upside when he is rolling like this, and I gave him a big leap from No. 39 to the top 25 now that he has returned to his high-usage role.\n\nAs much as I love his potential as a 3-point bombing scorer, I'm very nervous about having Bradley Beal on my rosters for the rest of the season. Nagging bone issues in a 22-year-old's leg is just about a worst-case scenario. He is young and hasn't built up any resilience and that isn't going to work itself out while playing more this season. I expect he will miss multiple stretches even once he returns from his current absence. The fact that he still is a borderline top-50 option the rest of the way, though, speaks to the production I expect for those stretches when he actually is healthy.\n\nWhether he is starting or working as a reserve, Zach LaVine keeps posting stats. If Kevin Martin ends up getting traded, LaVine is going to be a stud the rest of the season. He may even push himself into such a role anyway. I rank him in the top 75 for now, but he is a player I want on my teams for a second-half payoff.\n\nLaVine isn't the only player whose ranking is tied heavily to playing time, especially when it comes to the bottom 50 or so players. There is bound to be a lot of fluctuation here, because minutes and touches are going to have a big impact on role players and those who jump in and out of starting lineups.\n\nKent Bazemore is one example. To his credit, he was still churning out respectable stats as a reserve, but now that he is back to a solidified role in the Atlanta Hawks' starting lineup, he is far more enticing. I bumped him 10 spots.\n\nAlso on the move, thanks to a return to the Milwaukee Bucks' starting lineup, is Michael Carter-Williams, who jumped more than 20 spots. It seems that he finally has settled in as the impact guard many of us hoped he would be when the season began. He would be ranked even higher if I didn't remain worried about coach Jason Kidd's ever-changing rotation, but we won't have to worry about that in the short term, since he is away from the team recovering from hip surgery.\n\nOne more is Gorgui Dieng, who would probably be in the top 50 or so if he were a starter. His minutes have increased from 21 in November to 29 in December, which has allowed him to make some noise -- including three straight games with double-digit rebounds in the last week and a current seven-game streak with at least one block. He is playing well enough right now to round out starting rosters and is worth owning to see if his role expands as the season progresses. There is a lot of potential here.\n\nHeading in the other direction is Zach Randolph, who dropped near the bottom of my rankings. The writing seemed to be on the wall weeks ago, which is why he was barely even in my top 100 two weeks ago, but as a reserve, Z-Bo has no chance at seeing the volume he needs to make an impact in fantasy, since he has never done anything but score and hit the glass.\n\nFalling off the top 130 completely is Danny Green. What can you say? He has been a colossal bust, who has shown zero signs of progress to date. If he happens to wake up at some point, we can add him off waivers, but for now, it is time to move on.\n\nCreeping his way back onto the top 130 (barely) is Kobe Bryant. I knocked him off weeks ago due to his atrocious shooting (currently 33.9 FG% on 17.0 FGA), but his usage remains so high that he is producing plenty of other stats. If you have a roto roster constructed to hide that FG%, then he certainly can help your team. I still expect him to break down at some point, but he is a small investment at this point.", "Pound-for-pound rankings: Wladimir Klitschko out of the top 10": "Ray Flores and Brian Campbell break down how Canelo Alvarez's victory over Miguel Cotto will set up his future in the sport.

(2:24)\n\nFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- After Brent Venables resigned from Kansas State to join Bob Stoops at Oklahoma, Bill Snyder made one last-ditch attempt to keep his linebackers coach in Manhattan, using a carefully crafted question.\n\n\"How do you know,\" Snyder asked Venables, \"that he\u2019s gonna win, though?\"\n\nTo Venables, the possibility that Stoops wouldn't win never occurred.\n\n\"That didn't come anywhere in the equation,\" Venables recalled. \"I'm like, 'That's just gonna happen. It's Bob Stoops.'\"\n\nSeventeen years later, now the longest-tenured head coach in college football, Stoops continues to win at Oklahoma.\n\nThis season, the Sooners reached double-digit victories for the 13th time since he took over and captured their unmatched ninth Big 12 title. Just one year after a rare five-loss season, Stoops has quickly returned the Sooners to the national limelight by taking them to the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Capital One Orange Bowl, which kicks off Thursday afternoon with Oklahoma facing Clemson.\n\n\"As a leader, he\u2019s fearless,\" said Venables, Stoops\u2019 former longtime defensive coordinator who now calls defense for the Tigers. \"He exudes a very respectful, confident [air of], 'If you do X, Y and Z, then you\u2019re going to [win]. He just has that kind of mindset and confidence and assuredness.\"\n\nThe Sooners haven\u2019t always been at the top under Stoops. But Oklahoma has never been all that far away from it, either.\n\nThe combination of Stoops' steady hand and his bold willingness to reinvent when necessary is a big reason Oklahoma is as relevant in 2015 as it was in 2000 when the Sooners captured the national championship.\n\n\"Bob never gets too high, never gets too low,\" said Mike Stoops, his brother and defensive coordinator. \"His patience, his balance, you really see it. I see it. The program has been run virtually the same way for 17 years.\n\n\"He doesn't waver.\"\n\nWavering would've been easy to do after the Sooners collapsed down the stretch last season. Coming off its Sugar Bowl triumph against Alabama after the 2013 season, Oklahoma opened in the top five of last season's preseason polls. But narrow fourth-quarter losses to TCU and K-State preceded embarrassing performances against Baylor and Clemson, which trounced the Sooners 40-6 in the Russell Athletic Bowl.\n\n\"Just one of those years,\" Venables called it.\n\nStoops, however, also sensed that the Sooners had gone stale in many ways and needed a spark. So for the first time in his career, he fired one of his play-callers, letting go of offensive coordinator Josh Heupel, who had also quarterbacked the Sooners to that 2000 title.\n\nTo replace Heupel, Stoops targeted a 31-year-old who had never coordinated a Power 5 offense before, but had a background in the Mike Leach Air Raid attack that had fueled Oklahoma's immediate turnaround in Stoops' maiden season.\n\n\"When that area code came up, I had a pretty good idea of who it was,\" recalled Oklahoma offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley, who was then the playcaller at East Carolina. \"And [Stoops] was to the point.\n\n\"I [sensed] his desire to get back on track again and how hungry he was to do it and how close he felt like this team was -- if we could get a couple of things to go our way and get moving a little bit; he felt like we had some good players coming back offensively and that we were really, really close. I believed it.\"\n\nStoops' decision to bring in Riley and restore the Air Raid was a gamble. Not only was Riley relatively inexperienced, Oklahoma boasted one of the best rushers in the country in Samaje Perine, who seemed a ill-fit for the scheme. The Sooners also had only one proven receiver in Sterling Shepard, and complete uncertainty at quarterback after Stoops reopened the competition.\n\nBut even after the Sooners fell to Texas as a two-touchdown favorite in early October, Stoops' faith in Riley never flickered.\n\n\"He was 100 percent bought-in,\" Riley said. \"There were times early in the year where he could have questioned it -- through three quarters in Tennessee or the first half of the Texas game -- he never did and he showed an unwavering belief in it, and that\u2019s been a big part of why we\u2019ve improved.\"\n\nWith a few personnel tweaks along the offensive line and a renewed focus on using Perine, Riley's offense finally found its footing the following week. Oklahoma blasted K-State 55-0 on the road, and from then on, the Sooners have been as dominant as any team in the country.\n\n\"[That's why] I love and respect so much about where their program is today,\" Venables said. \"It\u2019s just a lesson to all of us -- you know, not so fast.\"\n\nRumors of Stoops' demise, it turned out, were greatly exaggerated.\n\nHe keeps on ticking.\n\nAnd in turn, Oklahoma keeps on winning.\n\n\"Bob is first class,\" Venables said. \"He's never changed, from the time he recruited me to [K-State] to all the success he's had.\n\n\"You know, winningest coach ever at Oklahoma? Are you kidding me? That\u2019s pretty special.\"", "United States falls to Sweden 1-0 at world juniors": "HELSINKI -- Linus Soderstrom made 46 saves and Alexander Nylander scored as Sweden shut out the United States 1-0 on Monday in the world junior hockey championship.\n\nNylander scored on a second-period breakaway.

Follow-up tests on urine and blood samples all proved negative.\n\n\"It is a relief,\" Radcliffe told BBC Sport. \"It should never have come to this. The reason I spoke out was to protect myself and protect my name. It was important that I took a stand knowing that there were other innocent athletes out there.\"\n\nThe IAAF said it was \"shocking\" that the distance runner should have been publicly accused. The organisation said in its statement: \"Paula Radcliffe was hounded remorselessly in the media for several weeks until she felt she had no option but to go public in her own defence.\n\n\"The circumstances in which Ms Radcliffe came to be publicly accused are truly shocking. She has been publicly accused of blood doping based on the gross misinterpretation of raw and incomplete data.\n\n\"Ms Radcliffe should never have been forced to come out and defend herself against such insinuations. When all of the necessary information is considered, however [as the World Anti-Doping Agency athlete biological passport protocols require], there are clearly plausible explanations for the values in her profile that are entirely innocent.\n\n\"The data therefore provides no basis whatsoever for the insinuations made against her.\"\n\nRadcliffe, who has always campaigned against drugs in sport, said in September that she felt forced to come out to defend her name. UK Anti-Doping said it had also concluded there was no case for her to answer.\n\nA UKAD spokeswoman said: \"After careful review, and in consultation with an independent expert, UKAD has come to the same conclusion as the IAAF review that there is no case to answer.\n\n\"The data does not provide any evidence that any anti-doping rule violation proceedings should be brought.\"\n\nIAAF president Lord Coe is to give evidence to the CMS committee on Wednesday and the world athletics organisation has come out strongly in defence of its handling of suspicious blood samples taken between 2001 and 2009, when athletes' biological passports were introduced.\n\nAn investigation by German broadcaster ARD and the Sunday Times suggested the IAAF had not followed up on the suspicious tests.\n\nThe IAAF statement said: \"In two of the cases highlighted by the Sunday Times, the samples were collected immediately after competition (when dehydration causes a decrease in plasma concentration, and so an increase in reported haemoglobin concentration, even though there has been no increase in red blood cells).\n\n\"Any competent scientist would therefore immediately conclude that they should be disregarded. Furthermore, the IAAF followed up by testing Ms Radcliffe's urine samples for rEPO, and her blood samples for evidence of blood transfusions, and all of those tests came back negative.\"\n\nThe IAAF said it screened nearly 8,000 blood samples for potential markers of blood doping, and followed up with thousands of urine tests to detect the presence of rEPO which has led to 145 athletes being caught with the blood doping agent in their systems.\n\nThe statement added: \"The World Anti-Doping Agency and Dick Pound, the chair of its independent commission, have also stated clearly and unequivocally that 'no test data derived from the IAAF database prior to the adoption of the ABP in 2009 can be considered to be proof of doping.\n\n\"It would be reckless, if not libellous, to make such an allegation.

He also routinely went to the body in the opening rounds.\n\nBarthelemy got off to a sluggish start by routinely switching stances and squaring up into the line of fire. Despite landing the heavier blows, he played right into his opponent's style.\n\n\"There were moments where I was trapped into my style of fighting,\" Barthelemy said through a translator. \"It took me a minute to adjust to Shafikov's style and exchange punches with him. I'm really happy with the number of punches I was able to get off.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Shafikov, he was never the same after suffering the cut, which Barthelemy began to target. Feeling the sense of urgency, Barthelemy repeatedly lined him up with clean left hands in Round 8 and used his footwork and size to avoid Shafikov's pressure.\n\n\"I noticed that I cut him, but once the ref stopped the fight to look at the cut, that is when I realized that I was going to be able to use that cut to my advantage for the remainder of the fight,\" Barthelemy said.\n\nBy Round 10, Barthelemy was controlling distance with his jab and finding a home for uppercuts from the outside. He also began to freely showboat and dropped his hands repeatedly without fear of retribution.\n\n\"I was really impressed with Shafikov's warrior style,\" Barthelemy said. \"He never gave up even after getting damages and punches that were affecting his fight. That really caught me by surprise and that he was able to last the whole fight.\n\n\"The fact that he continued really says something about him as a fighter.\"\n\n-- A cruiserweight bout between unbeaten fighters Isiah Thomas (15-0, 6 KOs) and Murat Gassiev (22-0, 16 KOs) was ruled a no contest after three rounds. Gassiev, of Russia, landed a hard right hand after the bell to end the round while Thomas was leaning back against the ropes. Referee Jay Nady, after consulting with the ring doctor, declared that Thomas, of Detroit, was too diminished to continue. Because the accidental foul occurred before the conclusion of the fourth round, the bout was ruled a no contest.\n\n-- Junior middleweight Eric Walker outpointed fellow unbeaten Chris Pearson (16-1, 11 KOs), of Trotwood, Ohio, in a spirited action bout over eight rounds. Walker (12-0, 6 KOs),of Plaquemine, Louisiana, who previously served 13 years in prison beginning at the age of 16, took home judges' scores of 79-71, 80-72 and 78-74.\n\n-- Unbeaten lightweight Gervonta Davis (14-0, 13 KOs) scored a ninth-round knockout of Mexico's Luis Sanchez (17-5-1, 5 KOs).

Thanks for everything.'\n\n\"I obviously thanked him, but it's been a team effort this year, just as we always stress. But there was a sigh of relief. I actually said, 'Mike, is there any way this putt won't go in?' It seems fitting, it has to.''\n\nThe putt didn't drop, but it hardly mattered. Spieth shot rounds of 67-66-68-67.\n\nThe year was complete, with the highlight being one of the best years ever in the major championships -- wins at the Masters and U.S. Open, a strong bid for the third leg of the Grand Slam at The Open where he missed a playoff by a shot, and then a runner-up finish at the PGA Championship.\n\nSpieth had 18 top-10 finishes in 2015 counting the Hero World Challenge and will finish the year ranked No. 1 in the world.", "Path to the playoffs: AL East": "With Christmas upon us, it seems general managers around the majors have taken a breather from their offseason wheeling and dealing, perhaps introducing themselves again to their wives and kids.\n\nThere are still premium free agents out there and trades to be made, but let's look at each division and where each team stands right now in its hunt for the 2016 postseason, starting with the American League East (teams are listed in the order they finished in last season's AL East standings).\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n\n2015: 93-69, +221 run differential, lost in ALCS\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 87-75\n\n2015 payroll: $135.7 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll from Baseball-Reference: $139.3 million\n\nThe Blue Jays' 2015 campaign was even more dominant than their 93-69 record suggests, as their run differential exceeded the next-best team (the St. Louis Cardinals) by 99 runs and was the biggest differential since the 2001 Seattle Mariners and Oakland A's. So their path back to the postseason is simple: Just repeat everything that happened in 2015 and reap the benefits of a full season from Marcus Stroman.\n\nWhat can go wrong? For starters, the offensive core isn't young: Jose Bautista will be 35, Edwin Encarnacion and Russell Martin 33, Troy Tulowitzki will be 31 with a long history of injuries. The Jays also enjoyed excellent health in 2015, as Bautista, MVP Josh Donaldson and Kevin Pillar each played at least 153 games, Encarnacion played 146 and Martin played 129. Four pitchers started at least 28 games.\n\nThe biggest change has been the shuffling of the front office: Longtime Indians executive Mark Shapiro was hired as team president and CEO, which led to the resignation of Alex Anthopoulos and the hiring of Ross Atkins as the GM.\n\nThe new regime will be more conservative -- Shapiro reportedly admonished Anthopoulos for trading away so many prospects -- and rather than cashing in on the team's playoff run and big attendance increase (more than 5,000 per game, a total that should climb even higher in 2016), the payroll has barely budged from 2015. The front office let David Price walk and instead re-signed Marco Estrada, signed J.A. Happ and traded for Jesse Chavez, rotation depth that should allow Aaron Sanchez to move permanently to the bullpen, where he'll team with Roberto Osuna and Brett Cecil for a nice 1-2-3 punch.\n\nThanks to a low hit rate and fewer home runs allowed, Estrada had the best season of his career. Happ went to the Pittsburgh Pirates late in the season and had an incredible 11-start stretch in which he posted a 1.85 ERA after tweaking his mechanics. The Jays are banking on those two and a healthy Stroman. If that trio performs, the Jays will go back to the playoffs.\n\nFor more on the Blue Jays, check out the Blue Jays Plus blog.\n\nNew York Yankees\n\n2015: 87-75, +66 run differential, lost wild-card game\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 89-73\n\n2015 payroll: $223.6 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll: $217.7 million\n\nThe Yankees received some inspired performances from veterans Alex Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira and Carlos Beltran in 2015 -- they combined for 83 home runs -- and rode a strong bullpen to return to the playoffs for the first time in three years. GM Brian Cashman wasn't about to double down on those old guys, however, and has brought in some younger legs: Second baseman Starlin Castro from the Chicago Cubs and outfielder Aaron Hicks from the Minnesota Twins. Add in first baseman Greg Bird, who played well filling in for the injured Teixeira late in the season; shortstop Didi Gregorius; and outfielder Aaron Judge, an in-season promotion candidate, and the Yankees could -- gasp! -- field a lineup with five players 26 or younger by season's end. Imagine that.\n\nOf course, Yankee fans are more upset that Hal and Hank Steinbrenner haven't dipped into the offseason's deep free-agent pool. Such is life in the Bronx, where attendance fell to its lowest total since 2000; 87-win wild-card teams aren't enough to placate these fans.\n\nThe Yankees finished second in the AL in runs, and assuming some regression from those vets, that means they'll need better production from Jacoby Ellsbury (.257/.318/.345) and Chase Headley (.259/.324/.369). But their path to the playoffs most likely resides in the health of the rotation. Masahiro Tanaka's elbow held together, although he did miss time with wrist tendinitis and a hamstring pull. Nathan Eovaldi went down in early September with elbow inflammation and Michael Pineda missed time with a forearm strain. CC Sabathia made 29 starts and then entered alcohol rehab; he hasn't been effective since 2012. Rookie Luis Severino posted a 2.89 ERA in 11 starts and will carry high expectations in 2016.\n\nThe old Yankees would have undoubtedly gone after one of the free-agent starters out there. These Yankees are content to hope that the Band-Aids on the arms hold together.\n\nFor more on the Yankees, check out the It's About the Money blog.\n\nBaltimore Orioles\n\n2015: 81-81, +20 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 78-84\n\n2015 payroll: $124.7 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll: $114.5 million\n\nCan we put an incomplete on the Orioles for now? As the Chris Davis negotiations stall, the Orioles' depth chart on MLB.com currently lists Mark Trumbo at first base, Nolan Reimold in left field, Ryan Flaherty in right field and Reimold and Jimmy Paredes at designed hitter. Ouch. That is decidedly not a path to the playoffs. They have reportedly agreed to a two-year, $7 million deal with Korean outfielder/first baseman Hyun-soo Kim, who hit .326 with 28 home runs and a .438 OBP in Korea. The Orioles need him to be one of the steals of the offseason.\n\nCatcher Matt Wieters did accept the team's qualifying so he's back on a one-year deal and setup guy Darren O'Day re-signed, so the O'Day-Zach Britton duo remains to lock down the late innings. But starter Wei-Yin Chen is a free agent and given his reported asking price seems like a good bet to be playing elsewhere. Of the remaining starters, Ubaldo Jimenez had the best ERA at 4.11. The Orioles allowed 100 more runs than in 2014 as the rotation ERA rose from 3.61 to 4.53. You can win without an ace, but you can't win without a No. 2 or No. 3 as well. The O's need better results from Chris Tillman, Miguel Gonzalez and Kevin Gausman.\n\nOh, and sign Davis and hope he hits 47 home runs again. As in years past, they'll otherwise wait out the free-agent market, hoping to find a bargain to fill one of the remaining outfield spots.\n\nFor more on the Orioles, check out the Camden Depot blog.\n\nTampa Bay Rays\n\n2015: 80-82, +2 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 84-78\n\n2015 payroll: $77.0 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll: $68.4 million\n\nHere's my sleeper team for 2016. They were respectable last year with 80 wins, even though they finished next-to-last in the AL in runs scored. So the obvious conclusion would be: Score more runs.\n\nI wonder if their path to the postseason is more likely by allowing fewer runs. The moves on offense have been minor and unlikely to make a major impact: Brad Miller in and Asdrubal Cabrera out at shortstop; Logan Morrison for first base and DH duties; and catcher Hank Conger. Getting more offense at catcher will help -- Rene Rivera posted a .489 OPS in 319 plate appearances -- and outfielder Steven Souza is capable of better numbers, but as currently constructed the offense doesn't appear to be much stronger.\n\nThe pitching, however, could be better. The Rays allowed the fourth-fewest runs in the league and that was with Drew Smyly making just 12 starts and Matt Moore, in his return from Tommy John surgery, making 12 poor starts. Pencil in those two for 30 starts apiece behind ace Chris Archer and Jake Odorizzi and the Rays could have a formidable rotation. Of course, Odorizzi has been mentioned in trade rumors with the Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers. But behind him, the Rays have Blake Snell, one of the top pitching prospects in the minors who posted a 1.41 ERA as he climbed from Class A to Triple-A.\n\nAnd if Rays fans really want to be hopeful, there's this nugget: They went 2-13 in extra-inning games. If they'd gone 9-6 they would have made the playoffs.\n\nFor more on the Rays, check out The Process Report blog.\n\nBoston Red Sox\n\n2015: 78-84, minus-5 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 92-70\n\n2015 payroll: $185.6 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll: $198.7 million\n\nThis one's easy: The Red Sox rotation had a 4.39 ERA, better only than the Orioles and Detroit Tigers in the AL. So welcome to Boston, David Price.\n\nIt's not that simple. Price alone doesn't turn the Red Sox into a playoff team. They'll still need improvement from other guys in the rotation, most notably Rick Porcello, who posted a 4.92 ERA and allowed 25 home runs in 172 innings. The bullpen was just as bad as the rotation, posting a 4.24 ERA, also 13th in the AL. So new president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski traded for closer Craig Kimbrel and setup guy Carson Smith, who had a dominant rookie season for the Mariners. With Kimbrel, Smith and Koji Uehara, the Red Sox could duplicate the late-inning dominance of teams like the Kansas City Royals and Yankees.\n\n(This impact could be overstated, however. The Red Sox's winning percentage when leading after seven and eight innings was actually right at the MLB average. But improved bullpen depth could help facilitate more late-game comebacks.)\n\nOn the other side of the ball, the Red Sox saw Mookie Betts emerge as a star. He'll be even better in 2016. After a slow start, rookie catcher Blake Swihart showed promise in the second half, hitting .303/.353/.452. Second-year shortstop Xander Bogaerts hit .320 and is capable of adding some power and OBP to his game. That trio is the new core of the Boston offense. That leaves the veterans: Does David Ortiz have one big season left in him? Will Pablo Sandoval rebound from his minus-0.9-WAR season? Will Hanley Ramirez play first base better than he \"played\" left field? Is Rusney Castillo actually any good?\n\nThe FanGraphs projection system likes the Red Sox as the AL East favorite right now. Of course, the projection systems loved the Red Sox a year ago as well. But with one of the best starters in the game now heading the rotation, a dominant closer and a talented group of youngsters, the Red Sox look like the surest bet to improve in 2016. And maybe the division favorite.", "Yoel Romero upset Ronaldo \"Jacare\" Souza in hard-fought fight at UFC 194": "Ronaldo Souza, right, recovered from a bad first round to defeat Yoel Romero by split decision at UFC 194. Ed Mulholland for ESPN\n\nLAS VEGAS -- Former Cuban Olympic wrestler Yoel Romero might have a shot at another form of gold in the near future.\n\nRomero (11-1) is the front-runner for a title shot at 185 pounds, following a split decision win against Ronaldo 'Jacare' Souza (22-4) on Saturday. The bout took place at UFC 194 inside MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n\nJudges Glenn Trowbridge and Tony Weeks scored the fight for Romero, 29-27 and 29-28, respectively. Judge Lester Griffin had it 29-28 in favor of Souza. ESPN.com also scored it for Souza, 29-28.\n\n\"I am ready for everybody,\" Romero said. \"I don't have a preference between Rockhold or Weidman next, there is no better style matchup. This is mixed martial arts so you have to be good at everything.\"\n\nThe highly anticipated fight, which was scheduled three different times in 2015 but fell through the first two due to injuries, nearly ended in the first round. Romero, who fights out of American Top Team, dropped Souza with a spinning back fist in the first. He cautiously went into the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt's guard and landed hard punches and elbows until the round came to an end.\n\nA former Strikeforce middleweight champion, Souza appeared to recover in time for the second round. Surprisingly, Romero didn't look to go after Souza when the round started, despite him wobbling back to his corner after the first. Souza landed a few right hands in the round and shot several takedowns, all of which were stuffed. He missed out on a takedown midway through when Romero grabbed the fence and received a warning.\n\nIn the third, Souza appeared to put the fight away when he stunned Romero badly with right hands along the fence. As Romero tried to regain his wits, Souza dropped for a takedown and spent the rest of the round on top. Nevertheless, two judges still felt Romero did enough.\n\nSouza suffers his first loss since 2011 and first ever in the UFC. Romero extends his win streak to seven, including a knockout over Lyoto Machida in June.\n\nDemian Maia, bottom, controlled the ground game against Gunnar Nelson to score his fourth straight victory.

Quinn explains the significance of the World Anti-Doping Agency's findings about the doping culture in Russia's sports programs that involved some of Russia's sports officials and the potential consequences. (3:00)\n\nGENEVA -- Russia's status as a sports superpower and its participation in track and field events at next year's Olympics came under threat Monday after a report accused the Russians of widespread, state-supported doping reminiscent of the darkest days of cheating by the former East Germany.\n\nThe findings by a commission set up by the World Anti-Doping Agency were far more damaging than expected. It means that two of the world's most popular sports -- soccer and track and field -- are now mired in scandals that could destroy their reputations.\n\nThe WADA investigation's findings that Russian government officials must have known about doping and cover-ups, with even its intelligence service, the FSB, allegedly involved, threatened to severely tarnish President Vladimir Putin's use of sports to improve his country's global standing. Russia hosted the last Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014 and will hold the next World Cup in 2018.\n\nEditor's Picks Ford: WADA report damning, but will change really come? Combine a spy thriller script with the justified cynicism around doping, and the result is WADA's independently produced report on corruption in Russian athletics, and track and field overall.\n\nUK Athletics chief calls for Russia suspension Ed Warner says Russia's place at Rio 2016 Olympics should be jeopardised following WADA report into doping -- but Russian president Vladimir Putin insists accusations are 'groundless'. 1 Related\n\n\"It's worse than we thought,\" said Dick Pound, an International Olympic Committee veteran who chaired the WADA probe. \"It may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system.\"\n\nSaid Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov: \"As long as there is no evidence, it is difficult to consider the accusations, which appear rather unfounded.\"\n\nThe 323-page report said that in Russia, \"acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread.\" Among its findings:\n\n\" Moscow testing laboratory director Grigory Rodchenkov ordered the \"intentional and malicious destruction\" of 1,417 doping control samples to deny evidence for the investigation.\n\n\" FSB agents regularly visited the lab, routinely questioned its staff and told some of them not to cooperate with WADA as part of \"direct intimidation and interference by the Russian state\" with the lab's work. Staff at the lab believed their offices were bugged by the FSB.\n\n\" FSB agents even infiltrated Russia's anti-doping work at the Sochi Olympics. One witness told the inquiry that \"in Sochi, we had some guys pretending to be engineers in the lab, but actually they were from the Federal Security Service.\"\n\n\" \"Widespread inaction\" by track and field's governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, and Russian authorities allowed athletes suspected of doping to continue competing. \"The Olympic Games in London were, in a sense, sabotaged by the admission of athletes who should have not been competing,\" the report said.\n\nThe WADA commission, set up after a German TV documentary last year alleged widespread Russian doping and cover-ups, recommended that WADA declare the Russian athletics federation \"noncompliant\" with the global anti-doping code, and that the IAAF suspend the federation from competition.\n\nWADA's findings Read the complete 323-page report released Monday from the World Anti-Doping Agency's independent commission.\n\nPDF \u00bb\n\nThe IAAF responded by saying it will consider sanctions against Russia, including a possible suspension that would ban Russian track and field athletes from international competition, including the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. IAAF President Sebastian Coe gave the Russian federation until the end of the week to respond.\n\n\"If they are suspended -- and it sounds like the IAAF is moving in that direction already -- and they are still suspended, at the time of Rio, there will be no Russian track and field athletes there,\" Pound said in an interview with The Associated Press after the release of the findings.\n\nThe IOC on Monday said in a statement that the report is \"deeply shocking\" and \"very saddening for the world of sport.\" The statement also said that it trusted Coe and the IAAF to \"take all the necessary measures\" regarding the suspension of Russian athletes for the Rio Games.\n\n''The IOC will also carefully study the report with regard to the Olympic Games,\" the IOC said. \"If any infringements on the anti-doping rules by athletes and or their entourage should be established, the IOC will react with its usual zero tolerance policy.\"\n\nPound said Russia's doping could be called state-sponsored. The commission said its months-long probe found no written evidence of government involvement, but it added: \"It would be naive in the extreme to conclude that activities on the scale discovered could have occurred without the explicit or tacit approval of Russian governmental authorities.\"\n\n\"They would certainly have known,\" Pound said.\n\nTo the AP, he added: \"We have finally identified one of the major powers as being involved in this. It's not just small countries or little pockets. This is a major sporting country. It's got to be a huge embarrassment.\"\n\nVladimir Uiba, head of the Federal Medical-Biological Agency that provides medical services to Russian national team competitors, said the report is part of a \"politically motivated\" campaign linked to the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nRussian athletes suspected of doping are also likely to keep their medals because canceling any results would require \"a huge number of legal proceedings,\" Uiba told the Interfax news agency.\n\nRussian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, whose ministry was accused by the WADA probe of giving orders to tamper with anti-doping tests, insisted Russia's problems are no worse than in other countries. Russia is being persecuted, he said, telling Interfax: \"Whatever we do, everything is bad.\"\n\nHe threatened to cut all government funding for anti-doping work, saying \"if we have to close this whole system, we would be happy to\" because \"we will only save money.\"\n\nMutko, who is also a FIFA executive committee member and heads the committee organizing soccer's 2018 World Cup in Russia, denied any wrongdoing to the WADA panel, including knowledge of athletes being blackmailed and FSB interference.\n\nPound said Mutko must have known.\n\n\"It was not possible for him to be unaware of it,\" Pound said. \"And if he was aware of it, he was complicit in it.\"\n\nPound said there may still be time for Russia to avoid the \"nuclear weapon\" of a ban from the Olympics if it starts reforming immediately. That work will take at least \"several months,\" and \"there are a lot of people who are going to have to walk the plank before this happens,\" he said.\n\n\"I think they can do it. I hope they can,\" he added.\n\nMore potentially damaging revelations are to come, and the crisis in athletics might ultimately trump even the criminal investigations into alleged corruption at FIFA.\n\nThe WADA commission is also looking at the role senior officials at the IAAF allegedly played in bribery and extortion involving Russian athletes. French authorities last week detained and later charged former IAAF president Lamine Diack with corruption and money laundering. The WADA panel's findings on that angle could come before the end of the year. For the moment, the commission said evidence of \"corruption and bribery practices at the highest levels of international athletics\" has been shared with Interpol.\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which brought down Lance Armstrong in another case that shattered public faith in sports, was damning in its response to the findings.\n\n\"If Russia has created an organized scheme of state-supported doping, then they have no business being allowed to compete on the world stage,\" USADA CEO Travis Tygart said.\n\nOther countries and sports could also fall under the WADA spotlight for abetting doping. Pound singled out Kenya, saying it seems that the East African powerhouse of long-distance running \"has a real problem.\"\n\n\"In its considered view,\" the WADA panel said, \"Russia is not the only country, nor athletics the only sport, facing the problem of orchestrated doping.\"", "Chasing Conor McGregor": "Frankie Edgar, the pride of Toms River, New Jersey, flew to Las Vegas last week to claim something many felt he already deserved -- a shot at the UFC's featherweight title.\n\nEdgar has done nothing but win in the past two years, picking off some of the sport's most recognizable names in BJ Penn, Cub Swanson and Urijah Faber. He's been denied a title shot though, mostly due to the meteoric rise of Irish sensation (and new featherweight champion) Conor McGregor.\n\nLast weekend was an interesting one in that, for the first time, the UFC promoted three events in three consecutive days. Edgar (20-4-1) headlined the middle card against three-time title contender Chad Mendes. The three days culminated in a featherweight championship fight between Jose Aldo and McGregor at UFC 194 inside MGM Grand Garden Arena.\n\nWhat was the experience like for Edgar, and did he end up claiming that coveted title shot? The former lightweight champion allowed ESPN.com to follow him through a crazy week in MMA.\n\nThe forgotten man\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\nEdgar checked into the MGM Grand on Monday, Dec. 7. The hotel was filled with banners promoting UFC 194's title fight between Aldo and McGregor. Even with that event scheduled for one day after his fight against Mendes, Edgar said it wasn't difficult to focus on the task at hand. \"Of course, the title is looming,\" Edgar said. \"But I don't think people understand the pressure I always put on myself. Everyone has doubts and you have to try and make that doubt go away. 'I'm not f---ing losing.' That's how I approach things on any fight week.\"\n\nAlmost ready\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\nOn Wednesday, the day prior to Edgar's weigh-in, he works out in an MGM room around 9 p.m., local time. Even as a featherweight, Edgar's weight cut is more manageable than most, meaning he has plenty of energy to get useful work in all week. \"I work out at the time I think I'm going to fight, to get the body clock right,\" Edgar said. \"I work out pretty hard, even the day before. I do five rounds of work.\"\n\nNo ups or downs\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\n\"At the beginning of my career, I'd come out for a fight week and I'd be feeling nerves the entire time. I'd have trouble sleeping all week. All I would do is think about the fight. Now, I don't get that until fight day. Sometimes, I'm even like, 'Man, I'm worried because I'm so damn calm.' Once you've had that title and you've been the main event -- I'd say after I had been in a main event, my nerves started getting better and better.\"\n\nFrankie who?\n\nAl Powers for ESPN\n\nWeigh-ins for TUF 22 Finale were held on Thursday afternoon in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The UFC hosted an open workout with McGregor and Aldo beforehand. By the time of the weigh-in, many fans had trickled out, leaving mostly friends, family and media members. By comparison, approximately 9,000 fans watched McGregor and Aldo get on the scale the following day's for UFC 194. \"I knew it was going to be tough to not be overshadowed this week,\" Edgar said.\n\nIn and out\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\nEdgar's walkout, always to \"Kick in the Door\" by The Notorious B.I.G., is one of the most well-known in the sport. He ran to the Octagon for the 19th time on Friday. As he was preparing to do so, Edgar saw UFC president Dana White leave the arena to attend to something backstage. Considering he was about to make a case for a title shot, it was slightly jarring to see the man who makes those decisions walk out. \"I saw him walking out as I was getting ready to walk in,\" Edgar said. \"I don't think he ever made it back out. I think he watched it from the back.\"\n\nHere comes the boom!\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\nEdgar wins via knockout at 2:28 of the first round, the fastest finish of his career. \"No one expected this out of me,\" Edgar said. \"I thought I was going to put a stamp on it, but more Frankie-esque. I thought I would grind it out and get a finish late. Did I expect to knock him out in the first round? I'll be honest, I didn't expect that -- but I didn't think it couldn't happen.\"\n\nThe waiting period\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\nAt the TUF 22 Finale postfight news conference, White praised Edgar's performance, saying, \"he'll get whatever he wants.\" Edgar later said, \"It's awesome he said that. Everybody heard it. I do believe I have a title shot right now, but you know, s--- happens and there's a big fight tomorrow. Whatever happens in that fight though, I think fans will be calling for me to get the shot.\"\n\nCircle of friends\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\nEdgar's team is a close-knit as you'll find in the sport. Included in those who celebrated his win on Friday were his wife, Renee, his parents, a lifelong wrestling coach he's known since he was a kid, one of his first teammates in the sport, a close friend from Toms River, his team and his manager, Ali Abdelaziz. \"I do feel right now like I've got the title shot,\" Edgar said from the edge of his hotel bed. \"I'm not going to whether I do or don't ruin my night though. It's out of my hands. If Aldo wins decisively, that's probably the best scenario for me -- but I think if Conor goes out and finishes him quick, that won't warrant an immediate rematch.\"\n\nDid I get it?\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\nEdgar and Renee were in attendance for UFC 194 on Saturday. McGregor unified the featherweight title by knocking out Aldo in a title fight record 13 seconds. \"I didn't know right then and there what it meant for me,\" Edgar said. \"I try to be positive but in that situation, after how close I've been to getting a title shot and getting passed over in the last couple years, I definitely felt a little negative about it. Someone from the UFC came to get me and brought me to the steps of the Octagon, so I thought, 'maybe they're going to announce this right here!' Then Dana came down and says, 'No, you're not going in there. We don't know what we're going to do. Conor might go up in weight.'\"\n\nIs Edgar next for McGregor? Who knows\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\nAfter the featherweight title fight, Edgar attended the news conference to get an idea of where he stood. White did not attend, however, and McGregor took so long to arrive that Edgar left. Before Edgar took off, media members swarmed him to get his thoughts on what happened. \"I talked to a bunch of press and made my case,\" Edgar said. \"In hindsight, I wish I would have known Conor was coming and stayed. I thought, 'This guy's not showing up.'\" When McGregor did arrive, he stated he would not vacate the 145-pound title, but seemed to lean toward moving up in weight for his next bout and fighting for the lightweight championship.\n\n\"I want to fight Conor\"\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\n\"That's really the bottom line. I want to fight Conor for the featherweight title. He's the champion right now. I don't want him going anywhere. I really believe I can beat him. People are calling for this fight. I think it's the most sellable fight Conor has right now. For me, it's about the belt, but I want to beat the guy who has the belt. I don't want to beat some other guy because whoever had the belt left. Even if I won the featherweight title, I'd still want to fight Conor because he was the last guy to have it. I think [this weekend's lightweight title fight between Rafael dos Anjos and Donald Cerrone in Orlando] will have a lot to do with what Conor does. I'm just going to keep putting myself in the best position to get that fight.\n\nWife knows best\n\nEd Mulholland for ESPN\n\nTeam Edgar. \"I'll call Dana myself if we don't get the title shot.\" -- Renee, on the night of Frankie's knockout over Mendes.", "Serena Williams wins AP Female Athlete of Year for 4th time": "Serena Williams spent a good portion of 2015 deflecting questions about whether she could complete the Grand Slam. After coming oh-so-close, she can acknowledge how much she cared about the rare feat.\n\n\"I wanted it. But ... winning one [major title] is not easy. And then, [when] you have a 'bounty' on your head, it's even harder,\" she said with a laugh. \"If you know anything about me, I hate to lose. I've always said I hate losing more than I like winning, so that drives me to be the best that I can be.\"\n\nSerena Williams, who won three of four Grand Slam tournaments this season, won The Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year for the fourth time, with 50 first-place votes. Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nWilliams' will was on display time and again this year, along with her best-in-the-game serve and other skills, fashioning comeback after comeback and nearly becoming the first tennis player in more than a quarter-century to win all four Grand Slam tournaments in a season. In a vote by U.S. editors and news directors, Williams was chosen as The Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year for the fourth time.\n\nResults were announced Friday.\n\nWilliams collected 50 first-place votes and 352 points. Carli Lloyd, whose hat trick in the final lifted the U.S. women's soccer team to the World Cup title, was the runner-up, with 14 first-place votes and 243 points. UFC star Ronda Rousey finished third, one spot ahead of the woman she stunningly lost to last month, Holly Holm. UConn basketball player Breanna Stewart was fifth.\n\nThe AP Male Athlete of the Year will be announced Saturday.\n\nWilliams, who also won AP awards in 2002, 2009 and 2013, joined Chris Evert as a four-time honoree. The only woman with more AP selections is Babe Didrikson, with six -- one for athletics in 1932 and five for golf between 1945 and 1954.\n\n\"It's not even winning the Grand Slam titles as much as the way she got herself out of the deep holes that she dug, just repeatedly. It's not like she had two or three narrow escapes,\" Evert said about Williams. \"It really was the year of the comeback. It was just unbelievable.\"\n\nWilliams won the Australian Open on hard courts in January, the French Open on red clay in June and Wimbledon on grass in July before losing in the US Open semifinals in September in one of the biggest upsets in the sport's history.\n\nIn all, Williams went 53-3 with a WTA tour-leading five titles and was ranked No. 1 every week. She raised her Grand Slam singles trophy count to 21; only two women -- Margaret Court and Steffi Graf -- have won more.\n\nIt did not come easily this year for Williams, who grew up in Compton, California, and turned 34 in September.\n\nAt the French Open, already dealing with a painful right elbow, Williams caught the flu. Four times in Paris, she lost the first set before rallying to win.\n\n\"My elbow was killing me. It's about fighting and just never giving up. You hear that and it sounds clich\u00e9,\" Williams said, \"but it's really just about, 'OK, I'm going to at least try and see what happens.'\"\n\nAt Wimbledon, she was two points from defeat in the third round but wound up completing a self-styled Serena Slam of four major championships in a row, a run that began in 2014. She also became the oldest woman to win a major title in the Open era, which began in 1968.\n\n\"I retired at 34, and I know that at 32, 33 and 34, I was struggling mentally to get psyched up for matches and to feel motivated,\" Evert said. \"What impresses me even more than the physical prowess of Serena is the fact that she can still conjure up that hunger and that passion for these matches. ... Sometimes [the motivation is] just not there. And the times when it wasn't there for her, she still created magic.\"\n\nOnly at the US Open, with the historic achievement of a calendar-year Grand Slam in the offing, did Williams stumble, losing a three-setter to 43rd-ranked Roberta Vinci of Italy.\n\nWilliams already is thinking about 2016.\n\n\"If I could have this year next year,\" Williams said, \"I would be really excited.\"", "New York Yankees add Aroldis Chapman to stacked bullpen": "The Deal: The New York Yankees have traded for Aroldis Chapman. If the Yankees stand pat in their bullpen, they will have a dynamic trio to finish games by combining Chapman with Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller. Chapman comes with baggage, as MLB is investigating domestic abuse allegations that could lead to a suspension.\n\nThe Reason: Chapman's price tag was lowered because of his off-the-field issues. After his trade to the Los Angeles Dodgers fell through, the Reds' asking price dropped significantly. Brian Cashman, who has tried to trade for Chapman before, got his man in a Cyber Monday-type bargain.\n\nThere is risk for the Yankees. It is unknown if Chapman will be a Yankee on Opening Day, because MLB could suspend him amid allegations of domestic violence.\n\nSince MLB has just constructed its policy for domestic abuse, it is unclear if, or how long, Chapman might be suspended. It is doubtful the Yankees made this trade without some assurances that Chapman will be a Yankee for much of the 2016 season.\n\nOn the field, the Yankees' deal for Aroldis Chapman is a steal. Off the field, though, the fireballer's fate remains to be determined. Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nChapman is 27 and can become a free agent after this season. He is likely to make around $13 million in 2016, pending arbitration.\n\nThe Yankees gave up some good prospects, but not their best. Rookie Davis is a 22-year-old righty who had a near 4.00 ERA between Class A Tampa and Double-A Trenton on 2015, but he's someone skipper Joe Girardi seemed to be high on. Eric Jagielo is a 23-year-old third baseman who was a first-rounder in 2013. He has been OK in the minors, making the Eastern League All-Star Game last season, hitting .284 with nine homers and 35 RBIs in 58 games at Trenton. Righty Caleb Cotham was a Girardi favorite at one point in 2015. Cotham had a 6.52 ERA in 12 appearances with the Yankees last season. Tony Renda, 24, was a .269 hitter at Double-A in 2015 between stints at Trenton and the Washington Nationals' Harrisburg farm team.\n\nThe Impact: The Yankees simply got one of the best and most intimidating relievers in the game. Chapman has been an NL All-Star each of the past four seasons. He had 33 saves and a 1.63 ERA last season. His nearly 16 strikeouts per nine innings led all relievers in baseball. He had 116 total K's, which were second only to Betances' 131.\n\nCashman said the Yankees' intention is to keep Miller, Betances and Chapman for 2016. Cashman is not ready to declare a closer yet. All three have pitched in different roles and whatever inning they throw, they should be a dominant trio. Cashman also has the option of eventually trading Miller, clearing money (Miller is owed $27 million over the next three years) and perhaps adding a starter. For now, though, on the field, the Yankees are much better for 2016 with an overwhelming pen. They do have risk, bringing in Chapman considering his domestic violence situation.\n\nOn the field, this trade is a no-brainer, considering the discount bin price. Off the field, it remains to be seen.", "Davis Cup boosts Olympic tennis prestige": "Tennis will have that much-discussed and long-awaited \"fifth Grand Slam\" in 2016. It will take place in a newly built tennis stadium at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, and tennis can partly thank the Davis Cup for that.\n\nThe international team competition has had a renaissance, and elite players have seen a rise in the prestige -- and rewards -- of playing for their nations. And that's been a plus for the Olympic effort.\n\nAfter Andy Murray clinched the Davis Cup for Great Britain, his beaten rival, Belgium's David Goffin, told an on-court interviewer: \"He's the hero for his country and I think he deserves it.\"\n\nAt roughly the same time, Novak Djokovic tweeted to Murray:\n\nCongrats #teamGB on DC win! @andy_murray Seeing ur reaction after winning made me relive again how it was 4 us in '10.Well done,u deserve it Novak Djokovic (@DjokerNole) November 29, 2015\n\nOf course, the Davis Cup for 2016 could be dead in the water. It will be interesting to see who wins the annual competition in an Olympic year, when the already-overloaded schedules of the top players will almost certainly rule out early firm commitment to next year's Davis Cup.\n\nBut that's all right with the promoters of the Davis Cup, the International Tennis Federation. The agency also promotes the Olympics. And a weak Davis Cup competition once every four years is a small price to pay for the increased attention that will be paid to Olympic tennis by players and spectators alike.\n\nHosting the tennis portion of the Olympics on the grass at storied Wimbledon in 2012 certainly boosted the credibility of Olympic tennis. So did the Cinderella story mowed into the lawns that year by Andy Murray, who won the singles gold medal for Great Britain.\n\nJust as significant, Olympic tennis at Wimbledon was an absorbing competition at which the top players dominated. Rafael Nadal was the only Big Four player who wasn't in the semifinals; he missed the entire event with tendinitis in his knees.\n\nIn past years, it hurt Olympic tennis when the medalists, at least in the men's event, didn't accurately reflect the true order of merit in the game. Nicolas Massu won gold in 2004 over Mardy Fish. In 2008, Nadal won gold over Chile's Fernando Gonzalez, who lost in the only Grand Slam singles final he reached. Olympic tennis was seen by many as a sideshow.\n\nEditor's Picks Caple: Is long schedule taking its toll on players? LeBron? MLB stars? They've got nothing on tennis players' grueling schedules. But while a shorter calendar is likely not in the cards, some wonder what can be done to help stars manage the grind.\n\nMurray issues challenge to Davis Cup teammates Andy Murray has challenged his Davis Cup-winning teammates to use the success as a springboard to climb the rankings in 2016.\n\nMurray greater than Perry after Davis Cup triumph In guiding Great Britain to their first Davis Cup victory since 1936, Andy Murray has surpassed the glittering Fred Perry as his country's greatest tennis player of all time. 2 Related\n\nNow, players who once shunned Olympic tennis have come to embrace it. Pete Sampras was a traditionalist; to him, tennis was all about the four Grand Slam events. He occasionally made room on his schedule for the Davis Cup. But the Olympics meant little to him.\n\nRoger Federer, Sampras' friend and successor, is no less a traditionalist. But the 34-year-old said three years ago that he definitely wants to keep playing until the Rio Olympics. Winning a gold medal in singles remains a bucket-list item for Federer -- one that could prove difficult to check off on the hard courts in Brazil with the likes of Djokovic, Murray, et al, in the draw.\n\nDjokovic, who hasn't won a singles gold either, has also prioritized the Olympics. In a Web statement released by the organizers in Rio, he said: \"One of the priorities of the next season is to try to get a medal for my country. I'm going to do everything I can possibly to achieve that.\"\n\nIs it mere coincidence that two of the most eager Olympic tennis hopefuls recently led their teams to Davis Cup triumphs? Federer and the Swiss won in 2014, and Djokovic led the Serbs to the title in 2010. That was the first Davis Cup championship for both of those teams. Great Britain's triumph this year was its first in 78 years and nearly as sentimental and historic a moment domestically as Murray's massive singles triumph at Wimbledon in 2013.\n\nInteresting detail: The growth of the game, combined with a rigorous annual schedule, leads some of the very top players to skip Davis Cup duty with some frequency. As a result, the competition once dominated by the U.S. and Australia is now up for grabs almost every year. At least a dozen nations have enough quality players to challenge for the Cup (think France), and the nature of the alternating-host rule adds some intriguing playing-field levelers.\n\nThese developments have all enhanced the cachet of nations-based competition, and the Olympics has been a great beneficiary. It's a shame the Olympics are held every four years, but a fifth Grand Slam every four years is better than no fifth major at all.", "McGregor's next move? Follow the money": "Conor McGregor explains his interest in moving up to the lightweight division while maintaining his UFC featherweight title. (0:30)\n\nLAS VEGAS -- Conor McGregor, the newly crowned unified featherweight champion of the world, stood alone at the dais on Saturday during a UFC 194 postfight news conference at the MGM Grand.\n\nDonning a fresh three-piece suit, the 27-year-old Irishman asked the room how he looked but didn't wait for a response.\n\n\"I think I look good up here,\" he said.\n\nAnd why wouldn't he? McGregor had just dethroned Jose Aldo, the most dominant featherweight in MMA history, in a 13-second knockout. He didn't even take a punch in doing so. Actually, wait, that's not true. Aldo was credited with one shot in the fight -- a glancing blow, which landed as he fell lifelessly to the canvas under a McGregor left hand. That was the extent of the pound-for-pound great's offense.\n\nIt felt as if the entire country of Ireland was on hand to witness the feat. There were videos of McGregor's fans spilling onto the Las Vegas Strip, stopping traffic. The iconic MGM lion statue in the hotel lobby might never recover from the sights of Saturday. Meanwhile, the event drew a live gate of $10.1 million. It's the highest in UFC history for a U.S.-based event.\n\nRather than attend traditional UFC news conferences, McGregor has now held his own media gathering after his most recent two fights. He no longer thanks the UFC for giving him the opportunity to fight in the Octagon; he thanks the fans and media on behalf of himself and the promotion. Considering that, historically, the UFC views fighters as contractors rather than partners, these are revolutionary statements.\n\nAfter dismantling his most fearsome (and obvious) foe to date in Aldo, the question turns to what's next. McGregor seemed to have a few ideas on the matter, but he declined to tip his hand.\n\n\"I'll give it some time,\" McGregor said. \"It's Christmas. In the fight game, you travel around, making weight or doing something. Christmas was taken from me many times. This Christmas was not taken from me. So, I get to go home. I've put in a hell of a lot of work. It's been a crazy, crazy year.\"\n\nWhen McGregor does return in 2016, here's a good bet on what will, in fact, be next: whichever fight is the biggest.\n\nMcGregor has interest in moving up to lightweight to become the third man in UFC history to win titles in multiple weight classes. His coach, John Kavanagh, told ESPN.com that Saturday would \"ideally\" mark McGregor's last 145-pound fight.\n\nConor McGregor needed just 13 seconds and one left hand to dethrone long-reigning UFC featherweight king Jose Aldo on Saturday. AP Photo/John Locher\n\nThat statement seems to conflict with McGregor's plans, though.\n\nMcGregor made it clear he has no intention of vacating the 145-pound title he just unified. Holding both would not only be historic -- the UFC has never had a champion hold belts in different weight classes simultaneously -- it would also allow him to constantly take the biggest and best fights.\n\n\"I feel there are a couple contenders in the [featherweight] mix,\" McGregor said. \"Maybe they compete against each other while I go take the lightweight belt. Allow a contender to emerge, then I go back down and fight that contender. Then go back up after a lightweight contender has emerged. That was the career path I wanted.\"\n\nThe biggest featherweight fight for McGregor might still be against Aldo in the form of a rematch, but UFC officials have already indicated that's not in strong consideration. The likeliest candidate to fight McGregor at 145 pounds is former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar, who is on a five-fight win streak and coming off a first-round knockout over Chad Mendes on Friday in Las Vegas.\n\nBut McGregor's next fight likely hinges on the outcome of next week's lightweight title fight between Rafael dos Anjos and Donald Cerrone in Orlando, Florida.\n\nIf dos Anjos, the champion, defends the belt, McGregor would probably go with a more fan-pleasing matchup in Edgar and hold off on moving up to 155 pounds. But if the wildly popular Cerrone wins, it's a safe bet McGregor would move up for that fight.\n\nThe carrot of a McGregor title fight (in any division) at Dublin's 100,000-seat capacity Croke Park continues to pop up every time McGregor wins, but according to UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta, several hurdles would have to fall into place for that become a reality.\n\n\"There always seems to be controversy when it comes to Croke Park,\" Fertitta said. \"I want to do Croke Park, but the fact of the matter is there are a lot of hurdles that would have to be cleared. It has to be the right time. It can't be in the middle of winter in Dublin. OK, will there be an opportunity in June, July or August? Will it be available? Third, we have to get the permits, and fourth, it would have to be a PPV that would happen in the afternoon here in the U.S. due to the time difference. So, the stars have to align.\n\n\"If we could schedule it now, we'd be all-in. Who doesn't want to do an event with 100,000 people? We're all about breaking records.\"\n\nFor that matter, so is McGregor. With Aldo conquered (and so much so that a rematch is unnecessary), expect McGregor to go where the money is, regardless of weight.\n\n\"There are weight divisions above, waiting for me to go at. Super fights left and right,\" McGregor said. \"Tell me one other champion that has been like that. Every other champion gets a belt and doesn't want to go up or they don't want to go down. I'm going straight up, bringing these big numbers, and the sky's the limit.\"", "Path to the playoffs: NL Central": "The National League Central has had both wild cards in two of the past three seasons and one wild card in 2013 and 2011. It's been the toughest division in the NL. While the Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds are taking a step back into rebuilding mode, the top three teams could once again all make the postseason.\n\nHere's a look at each team ...\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n\n2015: 100-62, plus-122 run differential, lost to Cubs in Division Series\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 88-74\n\n2015 payroll: $132.6 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $132 million\n\nCardinals fans have been frustrated by an offseason that saw the Cubs sign both Jason Heyward and John Lackey and the Cardinals counter thus far only with the signing of capable but unexciting Mike Leake. (Yes, \"capable and unexciting\" now equates to an $80 million contract that most thought was reasonable.) Maybe the Cardinals still have another signing in them, but their current payroll matches up with last season, suggesting their offseason maneuvering is likely complete.\n\nIf that's the case, the path to the playoffs will once again rely on the depth of a pitching staff that allowed the fewest runs of any team in a full season since 1972. Lackey and Lance Lynn (Tommy John surgery) are out, but Leake and Adam Wainwright are in, and the Cardinals will happily take the draft pick for losing Lackey. It's going to be difficult to repeat that kind of run prevention: The Cardinals had a 2.94 ERA but 3.47 fielding independent pitching. The staff ranked seventh in the NL in both walks and strikeouts, so it's not like it dominated in those areas.\n\nStill, Wainwright should be back at full strength after his torn Achilles heals, and Leake has been a durable 30-game starter throughout his career. If Carlos Martinez is healthy after the shoulder injury that shut him down for the postseason, the rotation should again be one of the best in the majors. The bullpen had a 2.82 ERA, third in the majors, and returns all its primary guys.\n\nSomething to keep in mind: The Cardinals won 100 games. Via the BaseRuns projection -- bases gained and bases allowed -- they should have won 89 games. So given the likely regression of the pitching staff, the offense will have to perform better after finishing 11th in the NL in runs. But there's also this: The offense may have underperformed a bit. It was fifth in the NL in OBP and ninth in slugging. While the Cardinals hit .253 overall, they hit just .242 with runners in scoring position.\n\nOf course, 2016 isn't 2015. Losing Heyward means the Cardinals will need Randal Grichuk and Stephen Piscotty to perform over a full season. Both hit better in the majors than they had in the minors. The Cardinals also need Matt Holliday to play more than 73 games and hope that Yadier Molina's second thumb surgery takes. Matt Carpenter was the team's surprising power source with 28 home runs. He struck out more but still drew 81 walks and led the NL in doubles for the second time in three years.\n\nThe ultimate key for a better offense, however, may be first base, currently some combination of Matt Adams, Brandon Moss and Piscotty. The Cardinals were 28th in the majors in wOBA at first base. If somebody steps up there, the Cardinals' chances increase for a sixth straight trip to the postseason.\n\nPittsburgh Pirates\n\n2015: 98-64, plus-101 run differential, lost wild-card game\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 87-75\n\n2015 payroll: $95.8 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $91.3 million\n\nThe Pirates have the second-most wins in the majors over the past three seasons, but all they have to show for it are three wild-card berths, the last two of which ended in defeat, to Madison Bumgarner and Jake Arrieta.\n\nNow comes the bad news: Three-fifths of the rotation currently consists of Jeff Locke (4.49 ERA in 2015), Jonathon Niese (4.13 ERA with the New York Mets in 2015 with the lowest strikeout rate of his career) and Ryan Vogelsong (4.63 ERA with the San Francisco Giants over the past three seasons). It's safe to say that the playoff chances of the Pirates reside on how those three -- or perhaps prospects Tyler Glasnow, Jameson Taillon or Nick Kingham at some point -- perform behind Gerrit Cole and Francisco Liriano.\n\nTrouble is, the Pirates' infield depth took a hit as Neil Walker was used to acquire Niese. They can slide Josh Harrison over to second base and will hopefully have Jung Ho Kang ready early in 2016 to play third base, but they've lost that ability to slide Kang between second, third and shortstop.\n\nThe Pirates will need Mark Melancon and Tony Watson -- by one measure, the two most valuable relievers in the majors over the past three seasons -- to once again be a dominating duo and they'll need Gregory Polanco to blossom from solid regular (.256/.320/.381) to star.\n\nChicago Cubs\n\n2015: 97-65, plus-81 run differential, lost NLCS\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 100-62\n\n2015 payroll: $133 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $162.2 million\n\nIt's not difficult to envision a path to the playoffs for the Cubs. The FanGraphs projection has them at 100 wins, the highest total in the majors, an especially impressive figure considering projection systems are usually pretty conservative.\n\nIn other words: The Cubs are loaded.\n\nOne thing I love about the Cubs' offseason: Not only does the Lackey signing bring a solid No. 3 starter behind Arrieta and Jon Lester, but the Starlin Castro-Adam Warren trade also brought back a solid swingman. With Kyle Hendricks, Jason Hammel, Warren and Travis Wood, they have tons of rotation depth in case of injuries.\n\nThe other reason to love this, of course, is the young offensive core. FanGraphs projects Kris Bryant at 5.6 WAR, Anthony Rizzo at 5.2, Heyward at 4.8, Kyle Schwarber at 2.9 and Addison Russell at 2.3. It's not unreasonable to expect all five of those guys to exceed those figures. And if Jorge Soler figures out how to hit those pitches that do bendy things ... watch out.\n\nIs there any chance this club becomes the 2015 version of the Washington Nationals, a World Series favorite that doesn't even make the playoffs? Sure, it's baseball. A long list of injuries ... the bullpen implodes ... Joe Maddon brings a tiger into the clubhouse and he bites off the arms of the entire infield ... I mean, I guess there's a way the Cubs disappoint.\n\nMilwaukee Brewers\n\n2015: 68-94, minus-82 run differential\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 73-89\n\n2015 payroll: $98 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $59.1 million\n\nYour path to the playoffs is probably slim when your owner is writing a letter to the fans that states, \"The commitment you've demonstrated to the Brewers, I assure you, is equaled by my own commitment to doing better. Each of you deserves that. By doing better, I mean fielding a playoff-competitive team and one day bringing a world championship to Milwaukee. To move toward accomplishing this lofty goal, I believe we need to take a step back and build more intensively from within.\"\n\nIt's the smart move. The Brewers' collapse down the stretch in 2014 spilled over into 2015, and it's time to rebuild. Considering the caliber of competition in the division, the Brewers weren't going to compete in the next couple of years. New GM David Stearns has a tall task ahead of him, but the Brewers do come from one position of strength compared to some other small-market clubs with a strong fan base that has allowed them to draw at least 2.5 million fans each of the past nine seasons.\n\nThe farm system is also in much better shape than it was a few years ago. Shortstop Orlando Arcia had a strong season at Double-A and could reach the majors in 2016, and the Carlos Gomez/Mike Fiers trade brought in two potential starting outfielders in Brett Phillips and Domingo Santana. Stearns will have to decide about trading catcher Jonathan Lucroy (they're probably stuck with Ryan Braun), and it would be nice if Matt Garza got off to a nice start so he could be flipped. Otherwise, it looks like the Brewers will be battling the Reds for fourth place and maybe hoping to finish fifth.\n\nCincinnati Reds\n\n2015: 64-98, minus-114 run differential\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 79-83\n\n2015 payroll: $118.8 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $103.3 million\n\nThe Reds are in the same boat as the Brewers. They tried to give it one more run last year, but Homer Bailey blew out his elbow, Jay Bruce was awful again, Devin Mesoraco got hurt, Billy Hamilton didn't hit and Johnny Cueto and Leake were eventually traded. The Reds started rookie pitchers in their final 64 games and ended up losing 98 games, the franchise's most since 1982. Whatever did happen to Paul Householder?\n\nAnyway, the Reds have traded Todd Frazier for second baseman/shortstop Jose Peraza, a glove-first slap hitter with speed. They tried to trade Aroldis Chapman, but we know what happened there. They apparently had a deal in place to trade Brandon Phillips to the Nationals, but Phillips invoked his 10-and-5 rights to veto it. Bruce has been minus-0.3 WAR the past two seasons, so even if somebody wants him, he won't bring much in return.\n\nAs of now, the Reds aren't as bad as the bottom feeders in the NL East. They still have one of the best hitters in baseball in Joey Votto. Hamilton and Zack Cozart are elite defenders. All the young starters at least picked up experience. And for now, they still have Chapman and Phillips.", "Kansas City is not the team that scares anyone but maybe it should": "As ESPN's Adam Schefter pointed out on Twitter on Sunday night, both teams everybody was supposed to be afraid of heading into the playoffs lost to inferior opposition. The Seahawks lost in their once-impenetrable home fortress to a Rams team with nothing to play for and Case Keenum at quarterback, a move that likely will knock them from the No. 5 seed (and a matchup against Washington) to the No. 6 seed (and a trip to play the NFC North champ).\n\nThe Steelers aren't quite as lucky. Their stunning loss to the lowly Ravens turned what seemed to be a guaranteed playoff spot into a coin flip. ESPN's Football Power Index (FPI) gives Pittsburgh just a 46.2 percent chance of making the playoffs after being swept by Baltimore, with the Steelers needing to pair a Week 17 win with a Jets loss or two Broncos losses (Monday night and next week) to make it to the postseason.\n\nAnother team that could have been in a similar bind, though, was able to hold on in Week 16 for what could end up being a very important victory. Like the Seahawks, they entered Sunday riding a long winning streak after struggling earlier in the season. And like the Steelers, they have a truly dominant component to their game that should terrify the opposition. Yet nobody is lumping them in with the teams everybody's trying to avoid.\n\nWhy isn't anybody afraid of the Kansas City Chiefs?\n\nBeing hot in December doesn't promise anything in January, but the Chiefs most certainly are. Their win over the Browns on Sunday was their ninth in a row, bringing them to 10-5 after losing five of their first six games. Those victories have been by an average of 16 points, with just two -- a 10-3 win over the Chargers and yesterday's 17-13 victory over Johnny Manziel and company -- coming by seven points or fewer. This is not a well-timed series of coin-flip victories.\n\nAnd yet who is truly \"scared\" of the Chiefs? One reason we highlight a team like the Steelers as one to avoid in the postseason is because it's simply easier to imagine an explosive offense putting together an incredible day than it is to envision a stifling defense swallowing some opposing attack whole. It's more tangible to think about Julio Jones leaping over an otherwise-competent cornerback for an indefensible touchdown than it is to imagine a really good defense forcing 14 punts and staying out of dangerous situations. The puncher's chance is always going to be more relatable than the cautious, defensive fighter.\n\nThe defense\n\nThe Chiefs are basically the polar opposite of the Steelers. Pittsburgh has an incredible offense and a defense that is almost entirely dependent upon takeaways. When it doesn't create turnovers, as was the case against Ryan Mallett and the Ravens on Sunday, the Pittsburgh defense looks cozy and inviting. The Chiefs, meanwhile, feature a dominant defense and an offense that is predicated upon avoiding giveaways. Force Alex Smith to commit turnovers and you're basically going to shut down the Kansas City offense. The difference in scale between the two is that Smith is better at avoiding turnovers than the Steelers are at creating them, and the Kansas City defense might be a step above the Pittsburgh offense.\n\nChiefs safety Eric Berry, who was diagnosed with lymphoma last year, has 41 tackles and two interceptions this season.

Since the start of Week 5, Bob Sutton's unit has allowed a total of just 145 points, an average of 13.2 points over 11 games. Nobody is within three points of them; the second-place Bengals are allowing 16.6 points per game. The next-closest team to have suited up for 11 games over that span is Houston, which has allowed 199 points.\n\nThat just isn't common. To put that in context, just five defenses have been better from the fifth through the 15th games in their respective seasons since the turn of the century than the 2015 Chiefs:\n\nPoints Allowed Games 5-15 Since 2000 Year Team PA 2000 Ravens 90 2005 Bears 109 2000 Titans 127 2011 49ers 127 2001 Eagles 133 2015 Chiefs 145\n\nNormally, when I see a stat like this quoted, my arbitrary endpoints alarm goes off. In short: Why measure a season five games in? It seems too easy a way to prove a point, and sure enough, the Chiefs were awful on defense in the first four games of the year. They allowed a combined 125 points over those four weeks, all against likely postseason contenders (the Texans and Broncos lead their divisions but are not guaranteed a playoff berth yet). You really can't just write those games off under typical circumstances.\n\nIn the case of the Chiefs, though, there's a strong case for arguing that the defense back then is far different from this current unit. The early-season version did not feature the same personnel playing at the same level:\n\nThe Chiefs were without cornerback Sean Smith, who was suspended for the first three games of the season after a DUI charge.\n\nNose tackle Dontari Poe made a stunning recovery from July back surgery to suit up for Week 1, but he was far from 100 percent and wasn't playing his usual heavy complement of snaps. After suiting up for 87 percent of the defensive plays in the first four games of the 2014 season, Poe was in for just 64 percent of plays over the same span this season.\n\nAnd of course, likely Comeback Player of the Year winner Eric Berry was still making his way back from offseason chemotherapy treatments. He also started off on a lower snap count and surely had to get back into game shape. And it's also worth considering that star inside linebacker Derrick Johnson was recovering from an Achilles injury he suffered in Week 1 a year ago.\n\nThose four are all contributing at a high level -- so much so, in fact, that the Chiefs have been able to get by on defense without their best player. Justin Houston has missed the past four games with a hyperextended knee, and on Sunday, he was joined on the sideline by fellow pass-rusher Tamba Hali. The Chiefs swapped in Packers pipeline product Frank Zombo and 2014 first-rounder Dee Ford and made do. Hali should be back for Week 17, and the team expects Houston to return for the playoffs. That's the last thing Chiefs opponents need right now.\n\nNow, you can make a case that those first four games should mean something. The players mentioned were all in the lineup for Week 4, and the Bengals still dropped 36 points on the Chiefs in Cincinnati. Houston's knee injury might continue to keep him out. And the Chiefs haven't really played a great offense during this dominant stretch of play; the only exception would be the Steelers, who lead the league in offensive DVOA, but the Chiefs held them to 13 points in a game Landry Jones started and finished. Even with that friendly schedule and the ugly four-game start to the season, though, the Chiefs are fifth in the league in defensive FPI and were fourth in defensive DVOA heading into the Browns game. This is a really good defense.\n\nThe quarterback\n\nThe classic complaint surrounding the Chiefs is that Smith isn't good enough to lead an offense to the Super Bowl. That argument, too, seems flimsy. Why are we sure that he's not good enough to take the Chiefs to Santa Clara? You don't have to go too far back in time to find quarterbacks who were worse than Smith who managed to win Super Bowls, especially when combined with great defenses.\n\nThere was a stretch at the turn of the century when quarterbacks like Smith won year after year, including Trent Dilfer with the Ravens, Brad Johnson with the Bucs and the still-in-beta version of Tom Brady with the Patriots, back when Brady was throwing checkdowns to Troy Brown and Jermaine Wiggins. (We like to pretend this version of Brady didn't exist, but superficial and advanced numbers tell a different story.) Smith would fit right in with that bunch, especially if he's bringing the league's best defense to the dance.\n\nAlex Smith gets plenty of questions about his passing totals, but probably too little praise for turnover prevention. Cary Edmondson/USA TODAY Sports\n\nAnother point that flies in the face of this argument is that we've already seen Smith in the postseason, and he hasn't really been a hindrance. In his first playoff game, he won a 36-32 shootout over Drew Brees and the Saints, running the exact sort of high-octane offense teams would typically be afraid to play in the postseason. Smith threw for three touchdowns and memorably ran in a fourth while leading the 49ers back for two lead-taking drives in the final four minutes.\n\nAnd then, in his playoff debut with the Chiefs in the 2013 season, Smith put up 44 points on the road against the Colts despite losing Jamaal Charles on the opening series. By the end of the game, injuries had cost the Chiefs starting wideout Donnie Avery and Charles' backup, Knile Davis, leaving Smith with Cyrus Gray and A.J. Jenkins as every-down weapons. Smith threw for 378 yards and four touchdowns, losing 45-44 as his defense capitulated in the second half.\n\nThe one playoff start in which Smith struggled was the 2011 NFC Championship Game, when his 49ers went 1-for-13 on third down in a 20-17 loss to the Giants. Even in that game, though, Smith posted a competent QBR of 46.5 and threw for two touchdowns. He lost to a Giants team that had just shut down Aaron Rodgers and later stymied Brady in the Super Bowl, and it came in a game in which backup punt returner Kyle Williams muffed two punts inside his own 30-yard line to hand the Giants 10 points on short fields.\n\nThe other reality is that Smith might be playing the best football of his entire career right now. He has posted a 65.7 QBR this season, which will be his best full-season rate as a pro. The right comparison to think about with Smith is somebody like right fielder Jason Heyward. Like Heyward, who lacks the sort of power you might associate with a superstar outfielder, Smith is well known for his conservative tendencies. His average pass travels a league-low 6.2 yards in the air, although that's far closer to the pack than last year, when his average throw went 5.6 yards in the air and nobody else was below 6.9.\n\nInstead, the bulk of their value comes from the more subtle parts of their game. Heyward generates incredible value in run prevention; Smith notably suppresses turnovers. After a shocking five-giveaway game against the Broncos in Week 2, including two picks from Smith, the Chiefs have avoided takeaways in seven of their ensuing 13 games. They've given away just five possessions in their nine-game winning streak.\n\nIn addition, Smith -- also like Heyward -- makes big contributions as a runner, a factor that remains bizarrely underrated. ESPN Stats & Information noted after Sunday's win over the Browns that Smith has scrambled for more yards during Kansas City's winning streak than any other quarterback in football. His 271 yards on scrambles are 40 more than any other passer in the league over that span, and his 17 first downs on scrambles are tops by four.\n\nSmith might not be one of the best players at his position in the way that Heyward is at his, but he's certainly good enough to push the Chiefs toward victories.\n\nThe slate\n\nThere's also something else worth mentioning: No matter what you think of Smith, the AFC playoff picture isn't exactly full of superstar quarterbacks. Yes, there's Brady. Otherwise, if the Steelers do miss the playoffs, Smith's almost definitely the second-best quarterback in the AFC bracket. He's clearly ahead of Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brian Hoyer. Most wouldn't hesitate to put Smith ahead of Brock Osweiler at this point, and while now isn't exactly the right time to make a joke about a rejuvenated Peyton Manning, the Manning who struggled through 2015 isn't on Smith's level.\n\nThat leaves the Bengals, who will roll out either AJ McCarron or Andy Dalton, the latter of whom has been far worse in the postseason than Smith and won't be 100 percent if he makes it back from his broken thumb.\n\nAnd with that in mind, the Chiefs might end up with a very friendly slate of opposing quarterbacks en route to the postseason. After beating the Browns, they're actually now slight favorites to claim the AFC West. The FPI gives them a 57.5 percent chance of winning their division, which they can accomplish by winning next week at home against the Raiders while hoping the Broncos slip up against the Bengals or Chargers.\n\nThat would leave Kansas City as the No. 3 seed and likely pit the Chiefs against Fitzpatrick and the Jets at Arrowhead in the opening round. They would likely get Brady at Foxborough in the divisional round, but stranger upsets have happened. Mark Sanchez has a playoff road win over Brady in New England. Joe Flacco has two. And the Patriots are banged up.\n\nAlternately, if the Broncos win out, the Chiefs could end up facing Hoyer (or Brandon Weeden) in the wild-card round. Then, if the Jets upset the Bengals, the Chiefs could avoid the Patriots and face Osweiler and the Broncos in the second round before getting to Brady (or Fitzpatrick) in the AFC Championship Game. This isn't a Group of Quarterback Death.\n\nThe coach\n\nThe other stumbling block is the less-than-pristine playoff reputation of Andy Reid, and that might be the biggest issue for the Chiefs to overcome. Reid is still 10-10 in the postseason, so it's not as if he's Marty Schottenheimer (5-13) or Marvin Lewis (0-6) in terms of postseason struggles. You can argue that most of those wins came early, during Reid's time in Philadelphia, but I see little reason to believe that he somehow became a worse coach over that time frame. He also took a badly flawed Eagles team within one possession of the Super Bowl in 2008, winning two road games along the way.\n\nThat's the only reason I'd hold back on making the obvious comparison between these Chiefs and a team from the recent past. This 2015 Chiefs team reminds me a lot of the 2011 49ers, a team that relied on excellent special teams, a physically imposing defense and Smith keeping the ball away from the opposition.\n\nThe difference between those two teams is that one had Reid and one had Jim Harbaugh. That's admittedly a big gap. Again, though, if you're looking to find an example of a coach with similar late-game misadventures who managed to win the big one, you don't have to look too far back. Tom Coughlin's been an absolute mess with his fourth-quarter decision-making for years now, and he has won two Super Bowls. Tony Dungy was hyper-conservative despite spending his time in Indianapolis with the greatest quarterback in NFL history, and he won a Super Bowl. Jim Caldwell, his replacement, called one of the worst timeouts in NFL history and still made it to a Super Bowl.\n\nThe Football Power Index is fonder of the Chiefs than most. It gives Kansas City an 11.3 percent chance of making the Super Bowl, the fifth-highest rate in the league entering Monday night's game. Those are better odds than the Broncos (8.1 percent) or Seahawks (7.9 percent) are getting. Although the Chiefs are not exactly the prohibitive favorites to make the trip to Santa Clara (the Cardinals are at 51.3 percent), they have a better chance of making noise in the postseason than you might think. Be afraid. Be at least a little bit afraid.", "Will New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin retire on his own?": "If the New York Giants decide it's time to move on from coach Tom Coughlin and Coughlin doesn't agree, the situation could get ugly. No one wants that. If at all possible, the Giants would like to send their future Ring of Honor coach out with the respect and ceremony that his contributions to the franchise's history deserve. But endings like these aren't always easy or neat, and it's possible things could be messy next week when this decision officially gets made.\n\nBut what if it doesn't have to get to that point? What if Coughlin, who looked and sounded totally defeated in the wake of Sunday night's loss in Minnesota, makes it easy on the Giants' owners and decides to walk away himself?\n\nTom Coughlin's future is a hot topic after the Giants' blowout loss in Minnesota. Andy Clayton-King/AP\n\nUntil very recently, I wouldn't have thought it was possible. Everything we've been told by and about Coughlin for years is that he has nothing to retire to, that he wants to coach as long as he's healthy and able and that they'd have to drag him out kicking and screaming.\n\nI'm not so sure anymore. The past few weeks have been very trying for Coughlin, who looks like a man who's realizing none of his tricks work anymore. He's still coaching the way he always has -- high-energy, intense focus on task at hand and simple, direct messaging to the players. He is convinced his players are hearing his message, and the players all indicated Sunday night that he's right. The problem is that the work isn't translating to results on the field, and that's what has Coughlin at a loss.\n\nThe things he has done for years to prepare his players to get up for even the biggest of games aren't working with this group. They didn't work Sunday, that's for sure. Coughlin knew the Giants had been eliminated from playoff contention when Washington won Saturday night. He was prepared with a bunch of good speeches about playing for pride. They've worked in the past.\n\n\"Last year, we played our last five games with no playoff implications,\" center Weston Richburg said. \"I don't know why it would be so tough to play one. It's our job.\"\n\nThat's Coughlin's message, and they're hearing it. They're just not performing. They're just not good enough. I think Coughlin knows this (he said, \"I'm not going down that road\" when asked about the talent on the roster Sunday) and that he knows how far this team is from contending. Therefore, it's not crazy to think he could decide he's just had enough.\n\nIf he really wanted to do this right, Coughlin would announce this week that Sunday will be his final game as Giants coach. If he did that, Sunday would be a celebration of his time with the team. Who'd show up and boo a two-time champion coach on his way out the door? It would be a chance to remind everyone of the joy Coughlin and his two title teams brought and for fans to thank him as he leaves. It would be a special day.\n\nOf course, that sounds nothing like Coughlin, who'll surely show up Wednesday and go through his usual routine of breaking down the opponent from every possible angle and working to get his team ready to beat the Eagles, regardless of the fact that the game has no significance to either team. In a lot of ways that's the more appropriate way for Coughlin to go out -- nose firmly affixed to grindstone, blocking out all the outside noise.\n\nHe still could force ownership's hand and make them fire him. This still has a chance to get ugly. But after the way Sunday night went, and given the way Coughlin and his players have sounded since that game ended, one wonders whether maybe Coughlin looks this whole thing over and decides it's just not worth the effort he's putting into it anymore.\n\nHonestly, who could blame him?", "Brant to headline quadrupleheader in 2016 'ShoBox' debut": "Middleweight prospect Rob Brant hopes 2016 will be a breakout year for him and he is poised to start it off well with a second consecutive main event appearance on Showtime's \"ShoBox: The New Generation.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old Brant (18-0, 11 KOs), of St. Paul, Minnesota, will take on DeCarlo Perez (15-3-1, 5 KOs), 24, of Atlantic City, New Jersey, in a 10-round bout on Jan. 22 (Showtime, 10:35 p.m. ET/PT) at the Casino Del Sol in Tucson, Arizona, Showtime announced on Monday.\n\n\"I'm really excited about this fight and I've been training hard for several weeks now,\" said Brant, a 2010 National Golden Gloves champion at 178 pounds. \"I've got a very serious opponent in front of me.

Instead of showing highlights from Bryant's 20-season career, the team showed a nearly 1-minute, 40-second video message from Michael Jordan, the Hornets' chairman and the player to whom Bryant has long been compared.\n\nThe video preceded the 37-year-old Bryant's final game in Charlotte, against the organization that drafted him 13th overall in 1996 before he was traded to the Lakers.\n\nMichael Jordan said in a video tribute Monday night that Kobe Bryant has been \"like a little brother.\" Vincent LaForet/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"Kobe, MJ. I'm sorry I couldn't be there tonight,\" Jordan began his message. \"I just want to congratulate you on an unbelievable career. I think, when I look back, and the first time we actually played against each other, and the competitive drive that I saw within your eyes ... is very invigorating. And I'm very happy to leave you this message to say how much we are very proud of what you've accomplished over the years.\n\n\"Most people don't realize you were drafted by the Charlotte Hornets, so that connects us with you. I've always been like a big brother to you, [and you're] like a little brother. We communicate all the time. I just want to say congratulations. Your next step in your next career is going to be something that I'm pretty sure you're going to have to figure out. From a competitive standpoint, I'm pretty sure you're just like me. You're going to have to find other ways to utilize that competitive drive.\n\nEditor's Picks Kobe on Hornets drafting him: 'Charlotte never wanted me' Kobe Bryant has long maintained that the Hornets didn't even want him when they drafted him in 1996, and he reiterated that point Monday.\n\nHolmes: Ahead of Boston finale, Kobe says green his favorite color Perhaps no stop on the Kobe Bryant retirement tour means as much -- or carries as much personal history -- as Wednesday's stop in Boston. 1 Related\n\n\"But I want to congratulate you and Vanessa and the girls. You've been a big help to the game of basketball. You've helped the NBA. You've helped promote it. I'm pretty sure you've got a lot of fans all over the world. I am a big fan. I still love watching you play. I'm very, very happy for you and what you've accomplished within the game. And I look forward to seeing what you do next.\n\n\"If you ever need me, you know my number. Let's stay in touch. I wish you the best, and have a great game tonight -- not too good of a game. But I want you to stay healthy. As I said a couple weeks ago, this is your last year. Just have fun. Take it a day at a time. Enjoy it. And I look forward to seeing what you do after this. Take care. Good luck.\"\n\nBryant went on to score 20 points on 5-of-20 shooting (3-of-12 from 3-point range) in Los Angeles' 108-98 loss. Bryant made just one of 10 shots in the second half, a 3-pointer with 1:02 left. He left the game a few seconds later to chants of \"Kobe! Kobe!\"\n\nBryant said he spoke with Jordan on Sunday and knew the video would be shown.\n\n\"It was awesome. It was awesome,\" Bryant said. \"He and I -- as he said in the video -- we talk pretty often. But it was pretty funny to see some of the reactions of my teammates. I was sitting next to Julius Randle before the game. He was like, 'Yo, that's amazing!' I was like, 'What?' [He said] 'That was Michael Jordan!'\"\n\nBryant added, \"We talk fairly often. I know he's enjoying a little vacation time. I told him I was a little jealous. He said, 'You'll be here soon enough.'\"\n\nWhile Jordan transitioned into an ownership role for an NBA team, Bryant said he doesn't expect to follow the same path.\n\n\"No, he and I differ entirely when it comes to that,\" Bryant said. \"He's a mathematician. He loves math. He loves numbers, loves dealing with numbers. I don't. I could care less. I suck at math. So from that perspective, I'm not going to be looking at cap numbers and all that other stuff. I just have no interest in it.\"\n\nBryant again was warmly received by a road crowd that chanted his name at numerous points throughout the game, including when the buzzer sounded.\n\n\"It's been like that every city, fortunately,\" he said. \"Here it's a little bit different because this is the city that drafted me, so my journey started here. As brief as it was, it still started here. That has a little more value to it.\"\n\nBut perhaps no stop means as much -- or carries as much personal history for Bryant and his team -- as the stop Wednesday, when Bryant will play his final game in Boston against the archrival Celtics, a team Bryant faced twice in the Finals. The Lakers lost in 2008, then won in 2010.\n\n\"Love-hate fest sort of thing,\" he said of what he is expecting from the crowd. \"I'm bringing my family down because my kids have never even been to Boston. They've never even been to Boston. I'm looking forward to them getting a chance to see the city a little bit and then just experience the green. It's just a different green. I want them to be able to see that.\"\n\nBryant also said he misses playing the villain, which meant being booed at road arenas.\n\n\"Yeah. It was just so natural to me for so many years,\" he said. \"It became something that just felt comfortable. It felt a little awkward at first, to be honest with you, to get this praise, but I'm glad they didn't do this many, many years ago because it's like kryptonite. It would've taken away all my energy and all my strength because I relied a lot on being the villain. Sometimes, the best way to beat the villain is to give them a hug.\"\n\nSo would he like more boos, especially considering the Celtics are up next?\n\n\"Nah, if [the 5-27 Lakers were] a championship-caliber team, honestly, I would probably come out and say something extremely controversial just to piss everybody off so everybody hates me for one more year,\" Bryant said with a laugh. \"But I don't need to do that.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "Gabriel Rosado outpunches Joshua Clottey for unanimous decision win": "VERONA, N.Y. -- Middleweight Gabriel Rosado, with former two-time junior middleweight titleholder Fernando Vargas working as his trainer for the first time, outfought former welterweight titlist Joshua Clottey to win a unanimous decision in a spirited fight on Saturday night on the Luis Ortiz-Bryant Jennings undercard at the Turning Stone Resort Casino.\n\nClottey (39-5, 22 KOs) fought well early but Rosado (22-9, 13 KOs), in his first fight in a year, came on strong to win 97-93, 97-93 and 96-94 and end a five-fight winless streak. Rosado came into the fight having gone 0-4 with a no decision since 2012 in official boxing matches, including stoppage losses in world title fight against Gennady Golovkin and Peter Quillin, although he went 1-0-1 in unofficial Big Knockout Boxing bouts.\n\nPunch stats Punches Rosado Clottey Landed 166 133 Thrown 791 455 Percent 21% 29% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\n\"It has been more than a year since I have been in the ring so I did feel a little I the rust but I feel like this fight really helped me shake it off,\" Rosado said. \"Clottey is a tough opponent, former world champion, definitely a challenge for me in my first fight back but I think that training with Fernando really helped me. I listened to him, made sure to do what he told me and focused on my hand speed.\"\n\nVargas was happy with his new pupil's performance in the fight that was contracted at 158 pounds to accommodate the smaller Clottey.\n\n\"Gabriel gave everyone a great performance,\" Vargas said. \"This was our first training camp together and I think we are going to keep growing an make great fights together.\"\n\nIn the opening round referee Benjy Esteves Jr. warned Rosado, 29, of Philadelphia, for hitting Clottey behind the head and then Clottey went down when Rosado caught him with an accidental elbow in the second round and Esteves gave him time to recover.\n\nClottey, 38, a Ghana native who fights out of New York, beat Rosado to the punch and was landing clean shots, including with a solid uppercut. By the third round Rosado had swelling under his left eye.\n\nRosado, with a starring role in the new Rocky movie \"Creed,\" turned it around. He got busier and began to force Clottey backward with a series of good right hands and body shots. He seemed to have Clottey in a bit of trouble early in the eighth round after landing several blows.\n\nEsteves warned Clottey for landing a low blow in the ninth round that angered Rosado, who also had swelling around his right eye. With the fight seemingly very close going into the 10th round, they both came out firing but Rosado won the round as he backed Clottey up and landed the cleaner punches.\n\n\"I think that I delivered an entertaining fight tonight and I was happy with my performance,\" Rosado said. \"I have great respect for Joshua Clottey. He is a great fighter and African warrior. I am ready for my next big challenge. I would like a shot at [middleweight champion] Canelo [Alvarez] next.\"\n\nClottey, who moved up in weight to make the fight, said he would return to junior middleweight.\n\n\"This was an off night for me,\" Clottey said. \"I do think that the fans enjoyed the fight. We are both fighters that do not like to back down. However, I don't feel comfortable at this weight class, I want to go back down to 154 and continue to fight at junior middleweight.\"\n\nShabranskyy upsets Gonzalez\n\nLight heavyweight Vyacheslav Shabranskyy and Yunieski Gonzalez engaged in a hard-hitting, action-packed fight that Shabranskyy won by majority decision.\n\nShabranskyy won 98-92 and 97-93 while one judge scored the fight 95-95.\n\nIt was an action-packed fight that really ignited in the third round when Shabranskyy ripped Gonzalez with a combination on the ropes that had him in some trouble before Gonzalez came back and then they ended the round in toe-to-toe exchange that had the crowd cheering. They went back and forth throughout the fight but Shabranskyy was getting the better of Gonzalez, who suffered his second loss in a row.\n\n\"I feel great. This fight is the most important and most exciting fight of my career,\" Shabranskyy said. \"I did feel a lot of Gonzalez's punches but I also feel like I hurt him, especially in the last round. He was beginning to sway. If I had a little more time I feel I would have knocked him out. I am very happy to have won and now on to celebrate the holidays and have some ice cream.\"\n\nPunch stats Punches Gonzalez Shabranskyy Landed 178 261 Thrown 603 821 Percent 30% 32% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\nGonzalez, 30, a Cuban defector living in Miami, was coming off a heavily disputed 10-round decision loss to former light heavyweight world champion Jean Pascal on July 25 in Las Vegas. Most ringside media had Gonzalez winning in what was his first notable fight and he was the heavy favorite against Shabranskyy.\n\nShabranskyy, 28, a Ukraine native living in Los Angeles, was the underdog mainly because although he scored a third-round knockout of Paul Parker in June, the unknown Parker knocked him down twice in the first round and nearly ended the fight.\n\nBut Shabranskyy (15-0, 12 KOs) showed a very good chin as he took some bombs from Gonzalez (16-2, 12 KOs).\n\n\"I knew that this was going to be a war and that is what we delivered,\" Gonzalez said. \"We both gave it our all and didn't let up. I knew that I needed to knock him out to win this fight but he was more resilient than I thought and didn't open up enough for the knockout to happened. I did know the fight was very close and should have been a draw in my opinion. I would like the opportunity to fight him again and prove that I am the better fighter.\"\n\nReferee Richard Pakozdi warned Gonzalez for landing a low blow late in the seventh round, after which he and Shabranskyy engaged in an extended exchange. They both landed huge punches, although Shabranskyy rocked Gonzalez with a right hand at the bell.\n\nThe 10th round was another terrific round that they closed in another toe-to-toe exchange, although Shabranskyy rocked Gonzalez. Golden Boy vice president Eric Gomez liked what he saw from Shabranskyy.\n\n\"He's willing to fight anybody. If Andre Ward wants to take that fight we'll do it,\" Gomez said of the former super middleweight champion who is moving up to light heavyweight and in need of an opponent. \"We'll talk to Peter Nelson (of HBO) and see what he wants to do but he will fight anybody.\"\n\nGamboa easily outpoints Williams\n\nLightweight Yuriorkis Gamboa, fighting for only the fourth time since 2013 and for the first time in 13 months, looked sharp in a unanimous decision victory against Hylon Williams.\n\nPunch stats Punches Gamboa Williams Landed 137 64 Thrown 572 343 Percent 24% 19% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\nGamboa, who turns 34 on Wednesday, won 98-92, 98-92 and 96-94 that appeared to be every bit the wide scoring of the first two judges.\n\n\"It feels good to be back in the ring,\" Gamboa said. \"I feel that all the hard paid off. I was faster and stronger in the ring. I know I dominated the action tonight. I made sure he knew I was in control from the first round. Once I established control I let him run around.\"\n\nFormer unified featherweight titleholder Gamboa (25-1, 17 KOs) came to the ring having had to borrow a protective cup because he forgot to bring one but he still toyed with Williams for most of the fight as he fired fast punches with a two-handed attack Williams had little answer for. He snapped his head back time and again with powerful shots and when Gamboa, a 2004 Cuban Olympic gold medalist who defected and lives in Miami, connected in the seventh round the best Williams could muster was to smile at him and make a face.\n\n\"I am not upset that this fight went all 10 rounds, in fact I am glad because I know everyone was able to see my power,\" Gamboa said. Williams (16-2-1, 3 KOs), 25, of Houston, landed his share of punches but has very little power and Gamboa did not seem troubled when he got hit.\n\n\"I felt good about the pace of the fight,\" said Williams, who was fighting for the second time this year after a three-year layoff. \"I know I hurt him a few times but I am fine. I don't feel hurt at all. I think this fight should have gone my way. I feel I was ahead.\"", "Path to the playoffs: AL Central": "The Royals dethroned the four-time division champion Tigers in 2015, survived in the Division Series against the Astros when they were six outs from elimination and down four runs, then rolled through the Blue Jays and Mets to win the World Series, Kansas City's first since 1985 and the AL Central's first since the White Sox in 2005.\n\nAnd yet ... the AL Central may be wide open. Here's the path to the playoffs for each team:\n\nKansas City Royals\n\n2015: 95-67, +83 run differential, won World Series\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 77-85\n\n2015 payroll: $128.8 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll from Baseball-Reference: $113.4 million\n\nFor the sixth consecutive season, the Royals improved their win-loss record -- going from 65 to 67 to 71 to 72 to 86 to 89 to 95 wins -- and topped it off with that World Series title.\n\nSo how do they get back to the summit? Notice the projection above: As the rosters are currently constructed, FanGraphs has the Royals as the worst team in the division. (Royals fans will point out that the various projection systems weren't keen on the Royals in 2015 either.) It's been a quiet offseason so far. The team has lost trade deadline pickups Johnny Cueto and Ben Zobrist while re-signing pitcher Chris Young and bringing in Joakim Soria to replace the injured Greg Holland in that late-game bullpen slot. Alex Gordon remains a free agent, as does Alex Rios (no loss there), so their starting corner outfielders right now are Jarrod Dyson and Paulo Orlando.\n\nThat's not going to cut it. That could be an acceptable platoon for one corner, but if there's room left in the budget -- the Opening Day payroll in 2015 was $112 million, same as their current projected payroll -- they should sign an outfielder or a pitcher, or both. While the Royals are still reportedly pursuing Gordon, they've also shown interest in starters Scott Kazmir, Yovani Gallardo and Wei-Yin Chen. Improving the rotation is a good idea: The Royals's starters were 12th in the AL with a 4.34 ERA while throwing the fewest innings.\n\nOne reason for that dour prediction above, however, is the projected performance of Lorenzo Cain, Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas. FanGraphs valued those three at 13.9 WAR in 2015; their projected number for 2016 is 9.1 WAR. Considering the outfield corners and the hole at second base (Omar Infante/Christian Colon), those three have to hit like they did in 2015 and not 2014. Even if that happens, the bullpen and defense will once again have to be stellar.\n\nMinnesota Twins\n\n2015: 83-79, minus-4 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 79-83\n\n2015 payroll: $108.3 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll from Baseball-Reference: $109 million\n\nAre the Twins ripe for further improvement ... or ripe for disappointment? It could go either way.\n\nOn one hand, the Twins have: A full season from Miguel Sano, rookie Byron Buxton taking over in center field, possible improvement from Eddie Rosario, outfielder Max Kepler and his .416 OBP in the minors winning a job at some point, and a potential impact bat in Korean DH/1B Byung Ho Park.\n\nOn the other: Sano is moving to the outfield and that could be a disaster of Hanley Ramirez proportions, Buxton may need more time in the minors after his major league struggles (44 strikeouts, six walks), Rosario had a .289 OBP, Park is a wild card, and the rotation and bullpen still look more mediocre than playoff-worthy as Twins pitchers were last in the majors in strikeouts once again.\n\nThe Twins ranked eighth in the AL in runs and ninth in runs allowed. So they'll need significant improvement in one of those areas or slight improvement in both. The other issue to consider is that the Twins outperformed their BaseRuns total by 10 wins. In other words, they were very good in clutch situations on their way to 83 wins, but clutch performance isn't a repeatable skill.\n\nUnless rookie starter Jose Berrios is ready to be a No. 1 or 2 right away, the key for the team seems to be the offense making big strides and, in particular, how the outfield takes shape. Can Sano handle the defense to go with the 30-plus home runs he'll hit playing every day? Is Buxton ready to produce? If Rosario is just a .289 OBP guy, will Kepler be ready to take over? A Sano/Buxton/Kepler outfield could be terrific, but it's more likely to be terrific in 2017 and beyond than 2016.\n\nCleveland Indians\n\n2015: 81-80, +29 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 87-75\n\n2015 payroll: $86.9 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll from Baseball-Reference: $72.7 million\n\nSo far the Indians have resisted trading Carlos Carrasco and Danny Salazar, and I think that's the right move: This team can win with a rotation built around those two and Corey Kluber.\n\nThe Indians were the opposite of the Twins: Their BaseRuns win total was 89; they won 81 games. They were particularly poor in bases-loaded situations, hitting .212/.304/.372, but the biggest culprit was the pitchers performing worse with runners in scoring position. Overall, the Indians allowed a .237/.297/.386 opponents' batting line; with RISP, opponents hit .269/.344/.425. Check out the three big starters:\n\nKluber\n\nOverall: .288 wOBA\n\nEmpty: .259 wOBA\n\nRISP: .344 wOBA\n\nCarrasco\n\nOverall: .285 wOBA\n\nEmpty: .268 wOBA\n\nRISP: .331 wOBA\n\nSalazar\n\nOverall: .299 wOBA\n\nEmpty: .294 wOBA\n\nRISP: .287 wOBA\n\nKluber and Carrasco were much worse with runners in scoring position. This could be a real thing -- for example, a sign that they have trouble working from the stretch -- but it could just be one of those things that happened. Kluber was fine with runners on base in 2014, as was Carrasco.\n\nOf course, more offense would be nice. Yan Gomes has to do better than a .267 OBP. Carlos Santana, now moving to DH, is capable of better power numbers. Lonnie Chisenhall's transition to right field went smoothly, but he still posted a sub-.300 OBP. Francisco Lindor will have to prove that his 99-game debut, in which he improved on his minor league numbers, is the real thing. Rajai Davis and Mike Napoli aren't solutions as much as spare parts. I would have liked them to bring in another big bat; as of now, the payroll is below their 2015 budget, so maybe there's room for a surprise signing.\n\nOne final note: The Indians had losing records against all four division rivals. April -- they went 7-14 last April -- will once again be important as they'll be without Michael Brantley as he recovers from shoulder surgery. The scheduling hitch: The Indians play only nine division games in April. That could be a good thing.\n\nChicago White Sox\n\n2015: 76-86, minus-79 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 81-81\n\n2015 payroll: $120.3 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll from Baseball-Reference: $118.4 million\n\nThe White Sox have now had three straight losing seasons and haven't had back-to-back winning campaigns since 2005-06. But in a way the Sox are admirable: They refuse to give in and tank and start over. In other words, they're not trading Chris Sale. This season won't be an exception: After last year's offseason haul (Melky Cabrera, Adam LaRoche, David Robertson, Zach Duke) didn't work out, they're at it again as GM Rick Hahn traded for Todd Frazier and Brett Lawrie.\n\nThe dividends there could be in the range of 5-6 wins, mostly because the players those two are replacing were terrible: The White Sox were last in the majors in wOBA at both third base and second base. So while Frazier and Lawrie aren't big OBP guys -- the White Sox were next-to-last in the AL in OBP -- they'll still be significant offensive upgrades, and Frazier's power should carry over from one good home run park to another.\n\nAnother key path to the playoffs will be better team defense. Only the Mariners and Phillies were worse than the White Sox according to the defensive runs saved (DRS) stat. As Buster Olney reported a couple days ago, the White Sox could still sign another outfielder. If it's Denard Span or Dexter Fowler, that would allow them to move Adam Eaton to a corner, displacing Avisail Garcia. Eaton was minus-14 DRS in center field and Garcia was minus-11 in right, but Eaton should be better in right or left, so they could improve defensively at two positions.\n\nTwo other reasons the White Sox could be better: Sale, for all his dominance (274 strikeouts in 208.2 innings), posted a 3.41 ERA and his fielding-independent pitching was 2.73, so if those two numbers align, he should win more than 13 games. Carlos Rodon went 9-6 with a 3.75 ERA as a rookie in 23 starts but has the raw stuff to make a leap forward. Note that over the final two months he posted a 2.28 ERA in nine starts as opponents hit .209 against him.\n\nDetroit Tigers\n\n2015: 74-87, minus-114 run differential\n\n2016 projection from FanGraphs: 79-83\n\n2015 payroll: $164.0 million\n\n2016 estimated payroll from Baseball-Reference: $170 million\n\nWith an aging roster and a thin minor-league system, the Tigers have no choice but to try to re-tool and see if the Miguel Cabrera/Justin Verlander Tigers have one more playoff run in them. So far they've added Jordan Zimmermann to the rotation, traded for Cameron Maybin to take over in center, added relievers Francisco Rodriguez and Mark Lowe and ... well, they signed Mike Pelfrey to a two-year contract even though he's never had back-to-back good or healthy seasons.\n\nWill these additions make the Tigers contenders? According to the FanGraphs projections, not yet: They're still just a 79-win team. Remember, Zimmermann is essentially replacing David Price, who made 21 starts with a 2.53 ERA before getting traded. The outfield will be without the 4.0 WAR that Yoenis Cespedes provided before his trade. Rodriguez and Lowe were very good in 2015, but it was also Lowe's first 50-inning season since 2009. Maybin may not be much of an improvement. The defensive runs saved metric didn't like his defense in 2015, crediting him with minus-16 DRS.\n\nThe way for the Tigers to return to the top of the division is to get better seasons from Victor Martinez, Anibal Sanchez and Verlander. Those three combined for just 0.7 WAR after contributing 8.4 WAR in 2014 and 12.3 in 2013.\n\nThere is speculation the Tigers will dig into owner Mike Ilitch's pockets for a left fielder -- Cespedes or Gordon or perhaps Justin Upton. Ilitch says he wants to win. He's 86 years old. The family's net worth is an estimated $5.4 billion, according to Forbes. Pay up, Mike. Sign that left fielder.", "Where does New York Mets' Asdrubal Cabrera rank among shortstops?": "Earlier this month, Buster Olney ranked the top-10 players in baseball by position. Five Mets made the cut or were listed as honorable mentions (Jacob deGrom, Matt Harvey, Jeurys Familia, Michael Conforto and Curtis Granderson). That got us to wondering where other prominent Mets rank. This article series takes a look.\n\nAsdrubal Cabrera\n\nIt appears that the Mets\u2019 priorities this offseason were certainty and versatility, and they got a little bit of both with the acquisition of Cabrera. Cabrera has played in at least 135 games in each of the last five seasons. He\u2019s hit 16, 14, 14 and 15 home runs the last four seasons. His OPS has fluctuated between .694 and .762, but was a respectable .744 in 2015. He has played 867 games at shortstop, 210 at second base.\n\nAsdrubal Cabrera - Weighted Averages 2013 to 2015 BA .253 HR 14 Games 142 Runs Saved -11 WAR 1.3 *Weighted averages = 3 x 2015 stats + 2 * 2014 stats + 2013 stats/6\n\nOne stat that might have gone overlooked in regard to why the Mets might need Cabrera is the performance of their shortstops against right-handed pitching last season. They combined for a .252/.301/.347 slash line. Cabrera\u2019s batting average is five points worse during the last two seasons, but his on-base percentage is 17 points better and his slugging percentage is 58 points better.\n\nCabrera does not rate well by advanced defensive metrics, but as we previously noted, he\u2019s considerably better than Tejada and Flores. The Mets allowed an abundance of hits in the shortstop-third base hole last season and the presence of Cabrera might turn some of those balls into outs.\n\nWhat the scouts say\n\nThe name that came up repeatedly in a conversation about Cabrera with a major-league scout was Cardinals shortstop Jhonny Peralta, a former teammate in Cleveland. Though much of that was related to defense, it applied to offense, too. Each was valued at 1.8 wins above replacement last season. Peralta\u2019s OPS was .745, one point better than Cabrera\u2019s. Cabrera\u2019s advantage over Peralta moving forward is age. Cabrera will be 30 in 2015, four years younger than Peralta.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a top-15 shortstop, but he\u2019s in the middle of the pack,\u201d said the scout. \u201cWhat I like about in him is his ability to switch-hit, and I like his hands defensively. Everything he gets to, he\u2019ll catch. Range-wise, he\u2019s limited, but he\u2019s still a quality baseball player. He knows how to do little things that help his team win. He may not match up to the kids at shortstop athletically, but he\u2019ll surpass them in baseball intelligence. His brain is top-10. He\u2019s still a very good guy to have on a major-league roster.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead\n\nESPN Insider Dan Szymborski\u2019s ZiPs projections are reasonably bullish on Cabrera, giving him a .258/.315/.421 slash line for 2016. Even with minus-10 defensive runs saved thrown in, that still translates to 2.2 WAR, which would make the first year of Cabrera\u2019s contract ($8.25 million) a good value. That would be 1.5 WAR more than what the Mets got out of Flores and Tejada, combined, in 2015.", "Sportswriter Joe Strauss, former St. Louis Cardinals beat writer, dies at age 54": "ST.

I've never been part of a team that's had this good of a start to the season, I don't think,\" Caps top-four blue-liner Karl Alzner said over the phone Tuesday. \"There's not much that you can be upset about these days. It's fun going to the rink.\"\n\nThe 25-6-2 Caps are finding a million ways to win, as underlined by these stats:\n\nThird in goals for per game (3.12)\n\nFirst in goals against per game (2.15)\n\nSecond on the power play (25.7 percent)\n\nSixth on the penalty kill (84.4 percent)\n\nIn other words, high-scoring games, low-scoring games, physical games, finesse games, coming from behind, playing with a lead or needing Vezina Trophy contender Braden Holtby to just flat-out steal a game -- you name it, the Caps this season have won any which way.\n\n\"That's what we were talking about yesterday on the plane and on the bus -- it was huge for us to be able to win the way we did against Tampa and against the Rangers, to come back like we did in those games, and not just come back but do it against teams who are really good quality opponents,\" Alzner said. \"We feel good. We're a confident bunch.\"\n\nA team-first approach is paying off for Karl Alzner and the Capitals. Jared Silber/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nOn Friday night, the Caps erased a 3-0 deficit to beat the Lightning 5-3. Then on Sunday, they wiped out a 3-1 hole to pound the Rangers 7-3.\n\nBut perhaps what impressed coach Barry Trotz even more than coming back Monday night was how they edged the Carolina Hurricanes 2-1 on the road -- a trap game if there was ever was one, being the seventh game in 11 days for the Caps.\n\n\"[Monday] night we get goals from [Michael] Latta and [Jason] Chimera,\" Trotz said Tuesday. \"And it's the stars, like [T.J.] Oshie, Ovi [Alex Ovechkin] and [Nicklas] Backstrom, they were the guys blocking all the shots. Usually your bottom-six guys are doing all the grunt work and your top six are maybe not as rigid there. It flips-flops from night to night for us, which is a good feeling.\"\n\nAgain, they are finding different ways to win.\n\n\"One thing about this group is that they do not accept losing,\" Trotz said. \"We lose one game and they're not happy. I really like that. It's something we started a bit last year, a culture change.\"\n\nThe hottest team in the East has all the respect in the world from the opposition, too.\n\n\"Timing is on cue with them, and they feel it,\" said one rival Eastern Conference coach via text message Tuesday. \"If their top two lines aren't scoring, the bottom two will score. If the five-on-five game isn't going, special teams will bail them out. If that isn't going, their goalie bails them out ... That's how you get on a roll.\"\n\nOne rival Eastern Conference general manager also pointed to the additions over the past two years of quality players Brooks Orpik, Matt Niskanen, Justin Williams and Oshie as impactful add-ons for a team that has struggled to get over the playoff hump.\n\nWhen all else fails for the Caps, there's Braden Holtby. Jean-Yves Ahern/USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"Those additions have made them a deep, win-now team,\" the GM said via text message. \"No. 92's emergence has been huge as support for No. 19. They have high expectations and they will have to handle any adversity now or in the playoffs. No one is unbeatable in this league and they have stayed away from injuries for the most part. The group and Barry have never been past the second round. It's hard. And Barry is a heck of a coach and fit there.\"\n\nNo one in Washington is hiding from the elephant in the room. The fact that the Ovechkin-era Caps have never been past the second round of the playoffs is not a subject that's off limits within the organization. Bring it on, Trotz said.\n\n\"We talk about it all the time. We're not ignoring that,\" Trotz said. \"I think in the past they've tried to ignore that a bit. We're not. We know this franchise hasn't done anything in the playoffs. We've had our failures. We need to get by the Rangers. We can go pretty deep but we haven't been able to get by the Rangers in three straight playoff series. I've been here for one, but we got to get that out of the way.\n\n\"Hey, we're all going to be judged on how far we go in the spring,\" Trotz added. \"We recognize that. But this group doesn't want to the season to end. They're having too much fun.\"\n\nThe reality is that the Caps could run the table through March, but people will reserve judgment until the playoffs.\n\n\"Yeah, and that's fair to say,\" Alzner said. \"I've talked to guys who have gone deep and have won, I've asked them what was so special about their team and what made the difference for them. A couple of times the response was that they played teams they're good against and had favorable matchups. That's part of it, I guess. We were a good team last year but just didn't have that favorable matchup against the Rangers, who have had our number.\"\n\nAlzner paused before adding, \"We're just looking to play the way we are and have fun. If we're meant to win, we're meant to win. We're going to give it everything we have. I think guys feel we have a special team right now.\"\n\nYou just sense this group is different. That this is finally the time for this team.\n\nAnd to me, the tone was set in the second game of the season, on Oct. 13. Ovechkin showed up late for a morning meeting that day and was scratched. That message resonated. No more special rules for star players. Everyone has to be pulling on the same rope.\n\nAlex Ovechkin, Matt Niskanen and T.J. Oshie are pulling in the same direction these days. Scott Audette/NHLI/Getty Images\n\n\"If one guy isn't doing what everyone else is doing, pulling on the same rope, we see that,\" Alzner said. \"And Alex has been tugging on that rope hard and he wants to win just as bad as everyone else does. If he doesn't do something right, he gets called on it. If I don't do something right, I get called on it. If Tom Wilson doesn't do something right, he gets called on it. That really brings team unity. Barry has done a great job of making sure we're unified in that sense. We all see it and we all react very strongly to it. That's a huge, huge thing for a team.\"\n\nTrotz said it's about fairness and honesty.\n\n\"I think the players trust me and my staff,\" he said. \"We're not trying to embarrass anybody. I'm fair to everybody, I give everybody equal respect. As long as you're pulling on the rope, we never have any problems.\"\n\nOvechkin has responded well, too.\n\n\"Ovi isn't having as good a year production-wise, but he's having a better year positionally,\" Trotz said of Ovechkin, who is second in team scoring with 17 goals and 13 assists in 32 games. \"Last year, I rarely used him in late-game situations, when the other team's goalie is out. Now he does it all the time. He takes pride in that.\n\n\"He's been really good, he's grown, he's in a really good place.\"\n\nA culture change has taken place. The Caps are truly a team now.\n\n\"Definitely the culture in the dressing room is a little bit different,\" Alzner said. \"I think we have guys who are so committed to the team, so committed to getting their bodies ready to play, and way more committed to being mentally prepared.\n\n\"I don't know, it's just working out so good right now. [The coaches] have changed everything and guys are really responding well to it.\"", "MLB rumors roundup: Gordon done in KC?": "Has Alex Gordon played his last game for the Kansas City Royals?\n\nThe Royals would like nothing better than to re-sign the home-grown Gordon, a core member of their first World Series championship team in three decades. But the 31-year-old Gordon is reportedly seeking a four-year deal worth about about $20 million per season, which is too much for the Royals\u2019 financial tastes.\n\nAccording to Jon Heyman of CBSSports.com, Gordon\u2019s camp has told the Royals that, as things currently stand, they have \"no chance\" to retain the All-Star left fielder. ESPN\u2019s Jim Bowden hears the Royals have offered Gordon a deal worth around $12-$13 million annually.\n\nIt is a sticky situation for the Royals, who finished last year with the 12th highest payroll in the majors. General manager Dayton Moore is still holding out hope the market will soften to the point that Gordon settles for a hometown discount. In the meantime, Moore is looking at other free-agent options such as Gerardo Parra and Denard Span.\n\n\u201cBarring a major surprise, it\u2019s hard to see where Gordon\u2019s open-market potential fits into the Royals\u2019 financial reality,\u201d writes Sam Mellinger of the Kansas City Star. \u201cSigning Gordon would require something the Royals have sworn off -- a long-term, big-money contract to an aging player, the kind of deal that almost never ends well for the team.\u201d\n\nThe Orioles, Cardinals, Angels and Giants are among the teams that have been linked to Gordon.\n\nBowden wrote Wednesday the Royals are staying in the mix for Gordon and will try to get a deal done with him before turning to Plan B, which could be Dexter Fowler or Parra.\n\nWith Matt Holliday likely a year away from free agency, Gordon would be a nice fit in St. Louis, suggests AJ Cassavell of MLB.com.\n\nWhile baseball\u2019s front offices may technically be closed for the holidays, there are still some rumors making the rounds on Christmas Eve:", "Andy Murray could miss 2016 Davis Cup ties with Rio Olympics on horizon in hectic season": "As Great Britain's Davis Cup team primed themselves for a swing at history and a possible first title since 1936, thoughts were already turning to the future and whether Andy Murray will be available to play all possible ties in 2016.\n\nWith next season an Olympic year, the demands on Murray's time and physical and mental energy will be more intense than ever before as he seeks to retain the title he won on the lawns of the All England Club in 2012.\n\nSuch was the historical and psychological significance of winning that gold medal, Murray will make preparing for the hard-court tournament in Rio de Janeiro one of his priorities for the season, as he would dearly love to spend another four-year cycle as the Olympic champion.\n\nWhile Murray has already indicated that he intends to play the first-round tie against Kei Nishikori's Japan, to be staged in Birmingham in March, there is less certainty about a quarterfinal tie, should Britain advance that far into next year's competition.\n\nThat would be played in July, the weekend after Wimbledon, and in the middle of what could turn out to be the busiest summer of Murray's tennis life, as he would also be expected to feature at two Masters-level tournaments in North America as well as at the U.S. Open.\n\nSuch were the demands that the Olympics place on leading players, Roger Federer was the only one of the 'Big Four' to have played in the Davis Cup in 2012, with Murray, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic not making any appearances in the competition that season.\n\nAs Murray has said, an away tie in July would make his life even more complicated. \"The plan is to play the first match against Japan and assess it after that. We could lose the first Davis Cup match and then it's not an issue,\" Murray said at a news conference recently.\n\n\"If we win the match, get an away tie and play on clay again, it could be tricky. But all the players are in the exact same position next year.

He had undergone a kidney transplant in late October.\n\nIn 1986, Henderson hit a ninth-inning, two-out, two-strike homer that lifted the Red Sox to a Game 5 victory over the Angels in the American League Championship Series. The Red Sox won Games 6 and 7 to advance to the World Series.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of Dave Henderson,\" Red Sox president Sam Kennedy said in a statement. \"His home run in Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS was a signature moment in Red Sox history, and we shared his unbridled joy when he hopped into the air as the ball cleared the fence in Anaheim. Hendu played just two seasons in Boston, but we always regarded him as one of us, and are grateful for the time we were able to enjoy his talent and infectious personality.\"\n\nHenderson also played on the A's last championship team in 1989, when Oakland swept the Giants to win the World Series, and was with the team for two other World Series appearances.\n\n\"The A's are saddened to hear of the passing of Dave Henderson,\" the team said in a statement. \"Henderson was an instrumental part of the A's 1989 World Series Championship club and an even more impactful member of the A's family and community.

The second run I was just trying not to think about the tiredness in my legs.\"\n\nLara Gut's second-place finish in the giant slalom Sunday carried her to the overall World Cup lead. Michel Cottin/Agence Zoom/Getty Images\n\nIt's been hectic for Vonn and Gut in the French Alps, first in Val d'Isere and then here for the giant slalom.\n\nGut won Saturday's downhill, which Vonn failed to finish after skiing off course. She also won Friday's super-combined, beating Vonn by one one-hundredth of a second.\n\nShe got the upper hand again this time.\n\nVonn was 10th in the morning first run but finished 13th as sunny conditions faded on the Emile-Allais course.\n\n\"It just wasn't quite right today. ... It was pretty dark second run, but normally I'm good at that,\" said Vonn, who picked up 20 World Cup points compared to Gut's 80. \"I just kept catching my edge doing weird stuff. I didn't really feel very balanced. But it was a good effort. I tried really hard and got some points.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Vonn felt tired after her near-crash Saturday and plans to have a rest far from the mountains before returning to action in another GS at the Austrian resort of Lienz on Dec. 28.\n\n\"After yesterday I'm just really sore and I physically need a break,\" Vonn said. \"I'm going to take a couple of days off, see my sister in Florence and get ready for Lienz.\"\n\nBrem's other race win was also a giant slalom -- last year in Aspen, Colorado.\n\n\"The first win I won because I'm a fighter and this one I won because I stayed cool,\" the 27-year-old Brem said. \"I think you need both. The first win is unbelievable, but after this one I was crying.\"\n\nBrem had come close this season, finishing second in giant slalom in the Swedish resort of Are last weekend and in Aspen last month.\n\nAfter raising both arms, she tumbled down and lay on her side for a few moments. When Brem got up, a grinning Gut rushed over to hug her.\n\n\"I'm very strong in the head,\" said Brem, who has 10 career podiums. \"But I just need that moment in every season when everything comes together.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old Loeseth was third in slalom last weekend in Are and third in slalom in January at the Croatian resort of Zagreb.\n\n\"It's a little strange for me that this is coming in GS, but I'll take it,\" Loeseth said. \"Hopefully 2016 will be even better.\"\n\nHer performance caps a great few days for Norwegian racing.\n\nOn Friday, Aksel Lund Svindal won a super-G ahead of Kjetil Jansrud and Aleksander Aamodt Kilde for an \"Attacking Vikings\" podium sweep.\n\n\"It's very inspiring to see how the boys are skiing,\" Loeseth said. \"They're pushing so hard.

On Tuesday, TMZ reported McGregor was offered a part in Vin Diesel's \"XXX\" sequel.\n\nConor McGregor was paid $500,000 for his fight against Jose Aldo, and will get $90,000 in bonuses and a cut of the pay-per-view revenue. Christian Petersen/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nIf McGregor, 27, is going to reach that figure, it appears he's going to have to stay relevant for a while. Filings with the Nevada Athletic Commission reveal McGregor was paid $500,000 for the fight against Aldo. He also gets a $40,000 bonus paid by the UFC for the Reebok outfitting deal and a $50,000 bonus from the UFC for the performance of the night. In addition, he'll get a cut of the revenue from what is expected to be more than one million pay-per-view buys.\n\nFertitta, who declined to predict a final number for McGregor's earnings Saturday, said McGregor's quick work of Aldo \"left people wanting more.\"\n\nMcGregor's next opponent has yet to be announced. Some suggest it will be the winner of this weekend's lightweight title fight between Donald Cerrone and Rafael dos Anjos. Former lightweight champ Frankie Edgar, who knocked out Chad Mendes in a featherweight bout last Friday, is another option. Given the way McGregor sent Aldo packing, it seems to be a long shot that Aldo would get another chance right away.", "'I'm very, very confident in my ability\"": "Unbeaten Rances Barthelemy has a plan for domination that involves one weight class at a time.\n\n\"My ultimate goal in the future is to be world champion in four or five weight divisions,\" Barthelemy said, through a translator. \"I want to move all the way up to 154, if possible.\"\n\nBarthelemy-Shafikov Where: Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas, Nevada\n\nWhen: Friday\n\nTV: PBC on Spike, 9 ET/PT\n\nBarthelemy (23-0, 13 KOs), a former junior lightweight titlist and Cuban amateur standout, moved up two weight classes to junior welterweight in June when he soundly outpointed veteran Antonio DeMarco, sending him into a brief retirement.\n\nBut he plans on making a brief pit stop at lightweight on Friday when he challenges Russia's Denis Shafikov (36-1-1, 19 KOs) for his 135-pound title. The Premier Boxing Champions main event takes place at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas (9 p.m. ET/PT, Spike TV).\n\nBarthelemy, 29, recently spoke with ESPN.com about his evolving style and what his goals are for 2016.\n\nIn your last fight against DeMarco, you were more offensive-minded than we had previously seen. What style can we expect to see from you moving forward?\n\nI've never had a problem with coming forward and throwing punches. I like to adapt to whatever the situation calls for. When I step into the ring and get a feel for how the fight is going, I like to adapt. I will defend when I have to defend, box when I have to box and throw punches when it's time to stand there and fight. I don't believe I'm going to have an issue doing that again. I've always had that style where I can switch it up between defense and offense.\n\nWhy do you believe many big-name fighters who have come from the same Cuban amateur system as you have been more reluctant to let their hands go as professionals?\n\nThe Cuban boxing system works more similar to the Olympic system which is based on points and accumulated points. Part of the reason that Cuban fighters struggle is because of the transition. In the amateur program in Cuba, you are always taught fundamentally to accumulate punches and always be on your defensive stand. You don't really come forward and throw a lot of punches. Instead, you just avoid getting hit. A lot of fighters struggle with that because here in the States, the style of fighting is a lot different. People focus a lot more on going to the body and coming forward and throwing more punches than avoiding getting hit. That's the biggest issue, that fundamentally you are raised that way in the amateur program.\n\nYou certainly opened a lot of eyes against DeMarco as to how explosive you can be. How would you grade that performance?\n\nI was actually really surprised with my performance. I was able to find my rhythm so fast. I was expecting a different fight from DeMarco because I know that he is a great fighter and a warrior. He goes in head to head with a lot of fighters he steps into the ring with. It's kind of telling, based on [DeMarco's] last fight with Omar Figueroa Jr., seeing how he went to war with him and even sent him to the hospital. So, when I stepped into the ring with [DeMarco], I was expecting a much different fight and was surprised how easy it was to get into a rhythm. I was very comfortable in there and I was able to set the pace and pretty much dominate how it turned out. I give a lot of credit to my training camp and the training that I'm doing alongside my trainer Ismael Salas.\n\nWhat type of fight are you expecting against Shafikov?\n\nI plan on controlling the distance. I do expect Shafikov to come with very natural abilities and strong fundamentals that I have seen him present during fights. I'm expecting that. He has a lot of natural ability so I'm looking for that. As far as the style of the fight, I'm expecting to go in there and find my rhythm. I need to keep my distance and foreshadow what I do by keeping that distance. He is going to shadow me and work the body and it's something that I'm expecting.\n\nConsidering the big names at 140 and 147 pounds under the PBC banner, what name are you targeting for a big fight in 2016 if you get past Shafikov?\n\nIn the past I have heard rumors that my name was in the top three of possible opponents for Adrien Broner. I also heard my name thrown around to be up against Omar Figueroa. Those were two names I was kind of thinking about or maybe considering possible opportunities in the future. But as of now I have stopped thinking about that in order to focus on Shafikov and what is in front of me. After Friday, I'll start thinking about what's next.\n\nYou have talked about your goal of winning titles in multiple divisions. But how important is for you to gain the kind of critical respect that comes with being ranked among the pound-for-pound best by the American media?\n\nI'm very, very confident in my ability, alongside my trainer Ismael Salas. He discovered a lot of things I didn't even know I had within me and the kind of things that other trainers were unable to pull out of me. I'm very confident and comfortable with his training camp and Salas has been telling me that he gives me until the end of 2016 or the beginning of 2017 to be named among the top list of pound-for-pound. That is my goal.\n\nYou have made some serious strides in your haircut game. Will we see the return of another flashy cut for this fight?\n\nYes, definitely. It's something that has kind of become a tradition now. Fans have actually started to ask me about my haircut and asked me to continue to do it so I'm going to switch it up again.", "Rex Ryan regrets playoff talk in first season with Buffalo Bills": "The His and Hers crew explains what has gone wrong for coach Rex Ryan this season with the Bills and if the organization needs to move on from him.

Jorge Linares (40-3)\n\nBen Hoskins/Getty Images\n\nLinares, a former featherweight and junior lightweight titlist, won a world title in his third weight class on Dec. 30 as he put away big underdog Javier Prieto with a sweet left-right combination in the fourth round in Tokyo. In his first defense, Linares went on the road to London to fight on mandatory challenger Kevin Mitchell's turf and engaged in a thrilling back-and-forth battle. Linares survived a fifth-round knockdown and, trailing on two scorecards, knocked out Mitchell in the 10th round of a dramatic fight for his eighth win in a row. While a rematch with Mitchell could be in the cards next year, Linares returned to Venezuela for a homecoming defense on Oct. 18 and hammered Mexico's Ivan Cano en route to a one-sided fourth-round knockout. He is supposed to make a mandatory defense next against Dejan Zlaticanin (21-0) and the sides are negotiating.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n2. Anthony Crolla (30-4-3)\n\nOn July 18, England's Crolla fought to a bitterly contested draw against titleholder Darleys Perez. An immediate rematch was ordered, and they met again on Nov. 21, again in Crolla's hometown of Manchester, with Crolla leaving no doubt this time as he knocked Perez out with a body shot in the fifth round to win the belt. Next up he is obligated to face interim titlist Ismael Barroso (19-0-2).\n\nNext: TBA vs. Barroso\n\n3. Dejan Zlaticanin (21-0)\n\nZlaticanin, of Montenegro, came out of nowhere in 2014 when he went to former titleholder Ricky Burns' home turf in Scotland and outpointed him. Two fights later, he ran roughshod over rising contender Ivan Redkach with ease, knocking him out in the fourth round on June 13 in a title eliminator to earn a mandatory shot at titlist Jorge Linares (39-3). Zlaticanin looks like he is going to be a handful for anyone in the division.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n4. Terry Flanagan (29-0)\n\nEngland's \"Turbo\" Flanagan scored a second-round stoppage of Jose Zepeda to win a vacant belt on July 11 in a fight that ended when Zepeda dislocated his shoulder. As unsatisfying as that ending was to everyone, Flanagan made up for it in his first defense on Oct. 10, as he destroyed quality contender Diego Magdaleno, dropping him three times in the second round in an impressive knockout victory. Defense No. 2 will come in a rematch with countryman Derry Mathews (38-9-2), whom Flanagan won a three-round decision against in the semifinals of a 2012 \"Prizefighter\" tournament.\n\nNext: Feb. 13 vs. Mathews\n\n5. Rances Barthelemy (24-0)\n\nBarthelemy, a Cuban defector and former junior lightweight titleholder, squared off with tough Russian southpaw Denis Shafikov on Dec. 18 in Las Vegas in the main event of a Spike-televised Premier Boxing Champions card and they put on a crowd-pleasing fight. In the end, it was Barthelemy's better skills and strong finish that led him to a unanimous decision win and a second world title.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n6. Ismael Barroso (19-0-2)\n\nVenezuela's powerful Barroso traveled to England to face longtime contender Kevin Mitchell for a vacant interim belt on Dec.12 and put on a tremendous performance. He scored three knockdowns en route to a punishing fifth-round knockout. Barroso must next face full titleholder Anthony Crolla (30-4-3).\n\nNext: TBA vs. Crolla\n\n7. Darleys Perez (32-2-1)\n\nColombia's Perez made his first title defense on July 18 in Anthony Crolla's hometown of Manchester, England, and was lucky to escape with a questionable draw. An immediate rematch was ordered, and Perez headed back to Manchester, where after a competitive four rounds on Nov. 21, Crolla landed a blistering left hook to Perez's body in the fifth round, dropping him for the count.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n8. Yuriorkis Gamboa (25-1)\n\nAfter a 13-month layoff, Cuban defector Gamboa, a former unified featherweight titleholder, returned Dec. 19 on the Luis Ortiz-Bryant Jennings undercard and soundly outboxed Hylon Williams en route to a dominant unanimous decision victory.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n9. Denis Shafikov (36-2-1)\n\nAfter losing a decision challenging then-lightweight titlist Miguel Vazquez in February 2014, Shafikov won three fights in a row and got a chance to challenge former junior lightweight titlist Rances Barthelemy for a vacant world title on Dec. 18. It was a good fight and Shafikov was highly competitive but he suffered a seventh-round cut that changed the rhythm of the fight and Barthelemy closed strongly to win a decision and take the belt.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n10. Petr Petrov (36-4-2).\n\nThe Russian-born, Spain-based Petrov won the 2014 Boxcino tournament and returned on April 3 to soundly outpoint former junior lightweight titleholder Gamaliel Diaz in an ESPN2 Friday Night Fights main event. He was due to travel to England to face Liam Walsh (19-0) in Manchester for the right to become the mandatory challenger for the winner of the card's main event between titleholder Terry Flanagan and current mandatory challenger Diego Magdaleno. However, Walsh suffered a broken hand, had to have surgery and the fight was called off.\n\nNext: TBA", "The big names who went down with injuries in Week 16": "A host of star players went down with injuries this week. Here are the most significant names who got banged up:\n\nMatt Hasselbeck, QB, Indianapolis Colts: For the fourth consecutive week, Hasselbeck was forced to leave a game due to injury. This time, he hurt his shoulder after getting hit by Dolphins DT Jordan Phillips in the second quarter. Hasselbeck, who earlier this week said that he was so banged up that he was on a liquid diet, went to the locker room and did not return to the game. According to ESPN Colts reporter Mike Wells, Hasselbeck said after the game that this injury was similar to one that he suffered in 2001, and it took longer than seven days to recover. If he's unable to go, Charlie Whitehurst will make his 10th career start.\n\nJadeveon Clowney, LB, Houston Texans: Clowney injured his foot at the beginning of the fourth quarter and was declared out by the team. The injury occurred with the Texans up 34-0 against the Titans and most of Houston's defensive starters on the sidelines. According to ESPN Texans reporter Tania Ganguli, Clowney had a boot on after the game, but he insisted that he was fine.\n\nMatt Forte, RB, Chicago Bears: Forte could be seen getting stretched by a trainer on the sideline during the fourth quarter. At the time, the team did not announce any specific injury to the RB, but he did not return to the field for the remainder of the game. Coach John Fox said after the game that Forte suffered a back injury. According to ESPN Bears reporter Jeff Dickerson, Forte had this to say after the game: \"I had a little nick. That happens to running backs, you get little nicks and stuff. I was trying to go back in, and they told me at that point there was no need to go back in. But I'll be all right.\"\n\nBryan Bulaga, T, Green Bay Packers: Bulaga injured his ankle at the beginning of the second quarter on a strip sack of QB Aaron Rodgers. He did not return to the game, and without him on the field, the offensive line struggled to protect Rodgers against the Cardinals' blitz-heavy scheme.\n\nB.J. Raji, DT, Green Bay Packers: Raji collided helmet-to-helmet with teammate Ha Ha Clinton-Dix while they were trying to bring down David Johnson near the end of the first quarter. Raji was taken to the locker room for evaluation, and shortly thereafter, the Packers ruled him out for the remainder of the game with a concussion.\n\nSebastian Vollmer, T, New England Patriots: The injuries continue to pile up for the Patriots. Vollmer, their starting left tackle, was carted off the field on the team's first possession after RB Joey Iosefa fell on top of Vollmer's left ankle. Shortly thereafter, the Patriots announced that he was out for the remainder of the game. According to Pro Football Talk, Vollmer suffered an ankle sprain and will have an MRI on Monday.\n\nTed Ginn Jr., WR, Carolina Panthers: Ginn grabbed his left leg after going down at the end of a 31-yard run in the second quarter from RB Cameron Artis-Payne. After being down on the ground of a little while, Ginn jogged off the field and eventually returned to play as the Panthers suffered their first loss of the season.\n\nRyan Tannehill, QB, Miami Dolphins: At the beginning of the third quarter, Tannehill appeared to get accidentally kicked in the shin by Miami TE Jordan Cameron while the QB escaped the pocket. Tannehill limped off the field in pain, but he returned to the game on the Dolphins' next possession.", "Rockets' inconsistency falls on Harden, Howard": "\u2014 From the Warriors blasting into the stratosphere to Kobe's farewell tour to resoluteness of the Celtics to the front office takeover in Philly to Paul George's inspiring comeback with the Pacers, the 2015-16 season has brought no shortage of interesting stories to the NBA.\n\nBut definitely none more underwhelming and confounding than the Rockets.\n\nThe team that won 56 games last season does not have a clue how to get back there. Two months in and the only thing they've accomplished is to get coach Kevin McHale fired and now his replacement J.B. Bickerstaff fired up in anger.\n\n\"Our issue is doing things right because it's the right thing to do,\" Bickerstaff told Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle on Saturday night. \"Not because it's going to get me a bucket, not because it's going to get me a shot, not because I get the glory. That's not what this is about. That's what our problem is right now.\"\n\nThe Rockets are a treadmill to oblivion 16-16 at the moment because their performance and effort rises and falls like the tide. Anybody that didn't see the \"playoff intensity\" Christmas Day win over the Spurs followed by the \"who cares\" collapse in New Orleans just hasn't been paying attention.\n\nOver and over again, we've disrespected the game. \u2013 Rockets coach J.B. Bickerstaff\n\nIt's not a question of whether the Rockets have the raw skills and amassed enough talent to win against the best good teams in the league. Victories over OKC, the Clippers (twice), at Dallas and over the Spurs prove that. It's an inherent lack of leadership and professionalism that fails to deliver the same work ethic each time out. See the 0-3 record against the Nuggets and 0-2 vs. the Nets.\n\nThat's on two names: James Harden and Dwight Howard, perhaps the most ill-fitted pairing of stars since Julia Roberts married Lyle Lovett. They are the core of the roster and at the heart of the problem, which in truth showed up in the early days of training camp. Back then the lack of focus and drive was attributed to a shortage of healthy bodies for practices and overlooked an underlying current.\n\nAfter opening the season with an NBA-first back-to-back-to-back 20-point losses, the Rockets have climbed back to peek their noses above the .500 mark by one game on three different occasions. But after beating the Clippers to get there, they lost to the Nets. After a win against the Hornets did it, they lost the next game to the Magic. Then the Spurs, followed by the Pelicans and here they are stuck in the hamster wheel again.\n\nMcHale has been blamed and dumped, a players-only meeting has been and promises for a fresh, recommitted start have been made and broken.\n\nSpurs vs. Rockets James Harden scores 20 points and dishes out 9 assists as the Rockets defeat the Spurs 88-84.\n\n\"Over and over again, we've disrespected the game,\" said Bickerstaff. \"Our priorities need to be clear and I need to do a better job of playing people whose priorities are clear.\"\n\nOf course, Bickerstaff vowed to get more playing time for Jason Terry after the 38-year-old guard sparked the fourth quarter play against San Antonio because, \"I just feel like we need him on the floor ... I trust that he'll carry his teammates in a positive direction.\" Then he played Terry less than 12 minutes in New Orleans.\n\nBut let's face it. If a backup guard playing in his 17th NBA season is the key to driving the engine, it isn't going very far in the first place. This is a problem for Harden and Howard to solve and they dance around the maypole with happy talk.\n\nPerhaps the problem stems from the Rockets' front office putting too much faith into what occurred last spring in the playoffs. Rather than accepting that it was yet another classic Clippers flop that blew a 3-1 lead and hand-delivered them to the West finals, the Rockets bought into the notion they had arrived at the elite level. The real challenge of reaching the NBA's final four is to stay there and a team built on a foundation of sand can see erosion set in quickly.\n\nWe've proven against the better teams in this league that we can do it and do it at a high level. It's a decision of whether we want to do it every night and so far we've chosen not to. \u2013 J.B. Bickerstaff\n\nIt's a bit painful to think that the one time general manager \"Shufflin' Daryl\" Morey didn't swap in his cards for a new hand, he's sitting here as New Year's Day approaches getting dealt the same busted flush over and over again.\n\nSeems the math wizard and godfather of the NBA analytics movement might not pay enough attention to chemistry. As organizational philosophy, the Rockets want to jack up 3s like they're shooting for stuffed dolls at a carnival midway, but they also wanted a post-up center who isn't exactly Bill Walton when it comes to passing. So why again did they want Howard?\n\nOr Ty Lawson, for that matter? Why did they bring in a true point guard to run with a ball-dominating off guard in Harden? Did the Rockets really think it would produce another Stephen Curry-Klay Thompson backcourt?\n\nRockets vs. Pelicans Anthony Davis scores 24 points with 13 boards, Eric Gordon drops 26 with six 3-pointers as New Orleans edges Houston 110-108.\n\nStill, at the root of it all is an uneasy, uncomfortable relationship between the two biggest stars, where Howard and Harden repeat the things that everyone wants to hear, then go right back out play their same games. In Harden's case, that's frequently the lackadaisical defense that drew such criticism two years ago.\n\nWhat's worse is that two of them can't find it within themselves to deliver the same effort level every game. It's not a question of the Rockets being a bad defensive team that too often is content to get into shootouts. They can lock down and get after it, holding the Spurs to 84 points. But then they give up 110 a night later in New Orleans, surrendering a nine-point lead in the last eight minutes.\n\n\"That's why our record is what it is,\" Bickerstaff had warned on Christmas night. \"We've got some good wins under our belt and some bad losses. We've proven against the better teams in this league that we can do it and do it at a high level. It's a decision of whether we want to do it every night and so far we've chosen not to.\"\n\nWhich is making the prospect of a new year look very much like the old one.\n\nFran Blinebury has covered the NBA since 1977. You can e-mail him here and follow him on Twitter.\n\nThe views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA, its clubs or Turner Broadcasting.", "Top 250 rest-of-season rankings for fantasy hockey 2015-16": "Injuries have continued to pile up on the goaltender front. It can make life extremely difficult for fantasy owners trying to manage their stats during a long season when values go through spikes and valleys with the prolonged absence of key goalie assets.\n\nWe will take a minute to go around the horn of goaltender injuries, listed by team and in order of the magnitude of the fantasy impact:\n\nMontreal Canadiens: The latest on Carey Price is that he is practicing with the team on occasion, but he is not on the current road trip that includes the Winter Classic later this week. The Habs, despite being in a complete downward spiral without Price, will take their time and make sure he is 100 percent. Coming back from an injury earlier this season, Price lasted two and two-thirds games before going back on injured reserve. Fantasy owners and the Canadiens have both experimented with Mike Condon and Dustin Tokarski at different times, but neither is up to snuff or worth leaving in your lineup. The acquisition of Ben Scrivens from the Edmonton Oilers on Monday will give the team another option, but not necessarily a good one. Scrivens has a 2-6-1 record in the AHL with a 3.47 goals-against average, an .893 save percentage this season, and he couldn't crack the shallow Oilers goaltender depth chart in the NHL. He's probably not a solution for fantasy owners, but desperate deep-league owners will want to take a flier. Price's original timetable of six weeks would take us into mid-January. That's not much longer to wait either way.\n\nPittsburgh Penguins: There have been no updates on Marc-Andre Fleury since he was said to be out for 10 days with a concussion. It's been almost two weeks. The Penguins are playing solid defensive hockey under new coach Mike Sullivan, leaving both Matt Murray and Jeff Zatkoff as approachable for fantasy owners. But with both showing decently enough this past week, it's hard to guess who will start the bulk of games if Fleury's concussion lingers. Murray is the choice if you have to pick one because Zatkoff made a terrible first impression by allowing six goals in the second game without Fleury. That allowed Murray to start the next three. But this will be Sullivan using the hot-hand approach, so neither goaltender is a 100 percent reliable replacement.\n\nNew York Islanders: Jaroslav Halak's upper-body injury is a bit concerning since he also missed the start of the season with a UBI. Whether it's the same affliction we don't know, but the concern is valid nevertheless. The bigger reason for taking a look here is that even before Halak's injury, backup Thomas Greiss was earning more than a backup's share of the starts on merit. In 15 starts and one relief appearance -- which is no small sample size -- Greiss has better ratios and only one fewer win than Halak in 20 starts. Greiss will now get a chance to carry the banner for at least a few games while Halak is on injured reserve. He is more than worthy of a pickup for fantasy owners, and may be worth hanging onto even after Halak's return.\n\nColumbus Blue Jackets: On fire before suffering a groin injury in early December, Sergei Bobrovsky is close to returning to action for the Blue Jackets. He was among the league's top-three fantasy goaltenders in the month before he was injured, completely shaking off a tumultuous start to the season. Joonas Korpisalo and Curtis McElhinney haven't been glowing in his absence, but that was partly due to the offense also drying up. Look for Bobrovsky to return to form when he comes back within the next week, and he'll be a solid No. 1 fantasy goaltender. After all, he can make the Blue Jackets' two goals per game stand up for a win.\n\nWinnipeg Jets: There still isn't a clear timetable on Ondrej Pavelec's knee injury -- beyond \"not December.\" Rookie Connor Hellebuyck has emerged as the clear best option in net ahead of Michael Hutchinson, but the Jets won't carry three goaltenders when Pavelec returns. Despite some hiccups along the way, Hellebuyck has been a clear No. 2 fantasy goalie for the past month, and his overall save percentage of .926 and his 2.12 goals-against average are more than respectable. He's still (shockingly) available in 51 percent of ESPN leagues despite posting solid numbers. If he continues this pace, fantasy owners won't have to worry about him going back to the AHL when Pavelec returns.\n\nVancouver Canucks: Ryan Miller will be out for another week with muscle cramps, and he's left the door wide open for Jacob Markstrom to gain ground on him. Miller's numbers are far from great this season. A 2.74 GAA and .909 save percentage have no place on any fantasy team. Markstrom has been on the prospect radar for fantasy owners since he was drafted as the Florida Panthers' successor to Roberto Luongo in 2008 (ironically, it turns out that Luongo's successor was Luongo, in a trade for Markstrom). He may feel like a bust because he's had his name bandied about since he was 18 years old, but he's still only 25 and could very much have a future in the NHL. An extended absence by Miller is what Markstrom needs to show he is ready for the next step. So far, so good, as he's posted two consecutive one-goal-against wins. Fantasy owners looking for a chance to catch lightning in a bottle will want to add Markstrom to their bench now.\n\nOthers: James Reimer was on the bench to back up Jonathan Bernier on Sunday, and will get his first start back for the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday against the Penguins. Reimer was playing out of his mind before he suffered an injury in early December. He's available in 66 percent of ESPN leagues and worthy of a speculative pickup by any fantasy owner with goaltender woes. ... The Arizona Coyotes can't limp through to March with Louis Domingue and Anders Lindback and expect to win games. Then again, that might be just fine with the young franchise with a core of budding superstars on offense. Unless the Coyotes make a move, don't expect to find any value here beyond spot starts until Smith returns. ... Chad Johnson's track record in the NHL and his current stretch of decent starts leaves us encouraged by the overall team defense of the Buffalo Sabres. That has us suggesting a stash of Robin Lehner, who was brought in to be the starter this season but has been out since the first game of the campaign. Lehner has returned to practice with the Sabres, making some progress with his ankle injury.\n\nForwards rising and falling\n\nMax Pacioretty, F, Montreal Canadiens (down five spots to No. 27): Pacioretty's resolution for the new year might entail investing in research for accelerated healing in fractured fingers. Before Brendan Gallagher suffered fractured fingers on Nov. 22, Pacioretty had 11 goals and 20 points in 22 games. Since then, Pacioretty has three goals and seven points in 15 games. It's a stark difference, and a reason for his slide in the rankings. We always thought of him as the catalyst for the offense, but it appears that Gallagher is a required component as well.\n\nJames van Riemsdyk, F, Toronto Maple Leafs (up 25 spots to No. 102): With seven goals and 16 points in 26 games through Dec. 3, van Riemsdyk was certainly on the fantasy radar, but probably not a high priority for most owners. On Dec. 5, he was placed on a line with Tyler Bozak and P.A. Parenteau. Since then, van Riemsdyk has five goals and 10 points in eight games. Clearly this is a line that works, and will continue to work together (until Parenteau is shipped off ahead of the trade deadline).\n\nDefensemen rising and falling\n\nAndrei Markov, D, Montreal Canadiens (down 21 spots to No. 115): Even though he's been back with P.K. Subban in recent games, playing apart from Subban for a stretch revealed an ugly fact to fantasy owners: Without Subban, Markov doesn't offer a whole lot of value. Markov has two assists in 12 games in December, as Nathan Beaulieu took the majority of shifts during the month as Subban's defensive partner. Markov will get time with Subban going forward, but we aren't as keen on him knowing what life would be like during a permanent separation.\n\nDougie Hamilton, D, Calgary Flames (up 32 spots to No. 191): It's certainly a crowded field on the Flames' blue line, with Mark Giordano, T.J. Brodie, Kris Russell, Dennis Wideman and Hamilton all viable fantasy options in the right situation. Hamilton seems to have turned the corner on his season after a slow first two months. After only five points in 24 games to start the season, Hamilton has eight points in 11 games during the month of December. It may have just been a matter of finding the right defense partner (Russell) and then taking some time to develop chemistry.\n\nGoaltenders rising and falling\n\nCorey Crawford, G, Chicago Blackhawks (up 12 spots to No. 19): The goaltender ranks have been marred this season by both injury and inconsistency. That's why Braden Holtby is out No. 1; And it's why Crawford is now our No. 2 fantasy goaltender. Carey Price will get back into this mix at some point, and Henrik Lundqvist will turn his ship back around too; but for now, Crawford has established himself as the de facto next best choice to Holtby. We still have a couple of months before it will become a big concern, but Scott Darling is a capable backup and will surely be used more often down the stretch to keep Crawford fresh for another postseason run.\n\nUpdated top 250 rankings\n\nHere are the updated rest-of-season, top 250 rankings of forwards, defensemen and goalies, including position ranks.\n\nNote: Sean Allen's top 250 players are ranked for their expected performance in ESPN standard leagues from this point on, not on the statistics that have already been accrued.

Lintao Zhang/Getty Images\n\nDavies was IAAF communications director at the time under Lamine Diack, who was succeeded by Coe as president in August. The French criminal case against Diack deepened this week, with magistrates filing new tougher corruption charges against him in connection with cover-ups of Russian doping.\n\nFrench prosecutors also suspect Diack's son, Papa Massata Diack, a former IAAF marketing consultant, played an active role in an alleged \"system of corruption\" that sought to blackmail athletes, with demands of money to hush up suspected doping.\n\nDavies is reported to have sent an email to Papa Massata Diack in 2013 asking what \"Russian 'skeleton' we have still in the cupboard regarding doping\" and suggesting using the marketing company chaired by Coe -- then IAAF vice president -- to lead an \"unofficial PR campaign\" to \"avoid international media scandals\" related to the Moscow championships.\n\nIf Russian athletes guilty of doping were not competing in Moscow, \"then we might as well wait until the event is over to announce them,\" Davies wrote in the email, which was published Monday by Le Monde.\n\nCoe is now losing one of his closest aides just as he tries to clean up the scandal-tainted governing body.\n\n\"In order to demonstrate that I am willing to have all allegations of unethical behavior on my part in 2013 properly and fairly investigated I have referred my emails to Papa Massata Diack in 2013, my statements and the circumstances of the emails to the IAAF ethics board,\" Davies said in Tuesday's statement.\n\nDavies has suggested that emails reflected his job \"to manage and promote the reputation of the IAAF.\"\n\n\"What has become apparent today is that I have become the story,\" he said. \"This is not helpful at the current time, with ongoing criminal investigations by the French police, the IAAF's ethics board or WADA -- all of whom I have voluntarily offered full assistance to and will continue to do so.\"\n\nRussia's track and field federation was suspended by the IAAF after a World Anti-Doping Agency independent commission found evidence of systemic doping and cover-ups.\n\nAn official with the Paris financial prosecutor's office said Tuesday that Lamine Diack is now accused of \"active corruption,\" which generally involves offering money or other promises in exchange for violating a rule.\n\nDiack had previously been accused of \"passive corruption,\" on suspicion he took around 1 million euros ($1.1 million) to cover up positive drug tests by Russian athletes.\n\nThe official told The Associated Press the new preliminary charges center on suspicions that Diack bribed Gabriel Dolle, the IAAF's former anti-doping chief who also under investigation, to delay reporting of violations by Russian athletes.\n\nThe official was not authorized to be publicly named speaking about an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe preliminary charges allow magistrates more time to investigate before deciding whether to file formal charges and whether to send a case to trial. Diack, an 82-year-old former long jumper, is free on bail pending further investigation but barred from leaving France.\n\nPapa Massata Diack told the BBC that his father is in \"good spirits\" despite the investigation.\n\n\"Suddenly they are just going to destroy all he's built over the last 16 years and all the 39 years he's spent in the IAAF, so I find it very sad and I could not recognize certain acts or certain declarations made by certain people,\" he was quoted as saying from Senegal.\n\nThe younger Diack also said he \"totally rejects\" accusations he himself had any role in blackmailing athletes or seeking money from Qatar ahead of its unsuccessful bid to host the 2017 world championships.

(0:34)\n\nORLANDO, Fla. -- A UFC heavyweight fight between Junior dos Santos and Alistair Overeem didn't deliver the action some expected -- but it did deliver the knockout.\n\nOvereem (39-15) scored the 17th knockout of his 16-year MMA career on Saturday, as he knocked dos Santos (17-4) down with a looping left hand in Round 2 and finished him with strikes on the ground. The heavyweight fight co-headlined UFC on Fox inside Amway Center.\n\nThe bout was originally supposed to take place for the UFC title in May 2012, when dos Santos was the defending champion. The month before the fight, however, Overeem failed a random drug test in Nevada and was not licensed to fight. The two have always seemed to be on a collision course since, but the matchup never came together until this weekend.\n\nFans were quick to boo a lack of action in the first round, as the two heavies showed a lot of mutual respect. Overeem slowly picked away at dos Santos with leg and body kicks though, which eventually led to the left hand.\n\nAlistair Overeem used a looping left hook to floor Junior dos Santos before finishing him off in Round 2. Al Powers for ESPN\n\n\"Junior is a very, very dangerous opponent,\" Overeem said. \"You have to fight cautious against him. He throws bombs. We had to soften him up a little bit. He's very dangerous, very strong. He has fast hands. Today it came together.\"\n\nDos Santos, who trained for the fight with a new camp at American Top Team in Coconut Creek, Florida, protested the stoppage by referee Dan Miragliotta. The 31-year-old Brazilian was in the action of getting to his feet as the fight was stopped, but Overeem was positioned behind him, throwing hard shots to his undefended head. The loss was the second by knockout of dos Santos' career.\n\nAccording to Fightmetric, Overeem outlanded Dos Santos in total strikes 19 to 17, despite throwing 17 fewer. The majority of his offense prior to the left hand came in the form of kicks, but he also bloodied dos Santos' nose in the first round with punches. In the second round, he opened a cut over dos Santos' right eye with a left cross.\n\nA former Strikeforce and DREAM heavyweight champion, Overeem signed with the UFC in 2011 and knocked out former champion Brock Lesnar in his UFC debut. He hit a skid afterward, losing three of his next four fights but has since rebounded with three consecutive victories.\n\nFighting out of Holland, and also with an association to Jackson-Winkeljohn MMA in Albuquerque, Overeem entered Saturday's bout ranked No. 7 in the division by ESPN.com. According to reports, it was the final fight on Overeem's UFC contract. Should he re-sign with the UFC, he'd be in a good position to finally fight for the promotion's title. Champion Fabricio Werdum is scheduled to defend the belt against Cain Velasquez on Feb. 6.\n\n\"I feel very confident with the team around me, from Holland and Albuquerque,\" Overeem said. \"I feel very confident for that next title shot.\"\n\nDiaz outpoints Johnson in slugfest\n\nNate Diaz, left, displayed his boxing skills in his unanimous decision victory against Michael Johnson. Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nIn one of the best lightweight fights of the year, Nate Diaz (18-10) defeated Michael Johnson (16-10) via unanimous decision (29-28, 29-28, 29-28) in a back-and-forth slugfest that saw a combined 246 total strikes landed. Diaz, who made his first appearance in 12 months, used his reach advantage well, tagging Johnson with straight left hands one after another. Johnson responded with hard leg kicks in each round and several combinations in close, punctuated by his own left hand. The fight featured just one attempted takedown, by Johnson at the very end of the final round.\n\nAs he's known to do, Diaz, the younger brother of UFC welterweight Nick, taunted Johnson throughout the 155-pound contest. He pointed and laughed at Johnson any time a big left hand landed. He slapped him with an open hand and then showed Johnson his palm. Johnson hurt Diaz with a right hand late in the fight and left the Octagon disgusted after the result was read. In his post-fight speech, Diaz called for a fight against newly crowned featherweight champion Conor McGregor.\n\n\"Conor McGregor, you're taking everything I worked for,\" Diaz said. \"I'm fighting you next.\"\n\nKowalkiewicz shines in UFC debut\n\nStrawweight Karolina Kowalkiewicz outpunched Randa Markos on her way to a unanimous decision victory. Al Powers for ESPN\n\nPolish strawweight Karolina Kowalkiewicz (8-0) scored a major win in her UFC debut, knocking off ranked contender Randa Markos (5-3) in a unanimous decision (30-27, 29-28, 29-28). Kowalkiewicz survived a bad position in the second round, when Markos managed to take her back and threaten with a choke. She was far more effective than Markos on the feet, however, and scored some heavy ground and pound in the third.\n\nOliveira submits Jury in Round 1\n\nCharles Oliveira submitted Myles Jury in a featherweight bout at UFC Fight Night on Saturday. Al Powers for ESPN\n\nFeatherweight Charles Oliveira (21-5) collected his eighth submission win in the UFC, tapping Myles Jury (15-2) with a guillotine at 3:05 of the first round. The Brazilian turned in a nearly flawless performance, taking Jury down early on and transitioning to his back. After Jury managed to escape that position and get back to his feet, Oliveira wrapped up the neck during the scramble and pulled guard for the win. Oliveira missed weight by four pounds prior to the win and forfeited 20 percent of his purse.\n\nMarquardt finishes off Dollaway\n\nNate Marquardt, left, stopped CB Dollaway in the second round to erase a two-fight losing streak. Al Powers for ESPN\n\nMiddleweight Nate Marquardt (33-16), of Denver, scored a highlight-reel knockout over CB Dollaway (15-8) at 0:28 of the second round. The outcome of the fight changed on a dime, as Dollaway had hurt Marquardt with punches moments before the knockout punch. As Dollaway charged in for a finish, Marquardt planted a sturdy counter right to the chin and that was all she wrote. It is the 10th knockout of Marquardt's career.", "Ramblings: Should the Predators trade Shea Weber?": "In a little more than a month, the NHL world will descend on Nashville, Tennessee, for the annual All-Star weekend.\n\nIt will be a time when the trade market will start coming into focus with the Feb. 29 trade deadline more clearly visible on the horizon.\n\nWhen it comes to the Predators, the question is: Can this team win a Stanley Cup as it is currently constituted? Could it even reach a conference finals?\n\nIf Mike Fisher comes back healthy and productive, if depth forwards Colin Wilson, Craig Smith and Cody Hodgson contribute more than they have thus far, and if Filip Forsberg rediscovers the star turn we saw early last season, the answer: maybe.\n\nAnd \"maybe\" shouldn\u2019t cut it for this franchise. Not with Pekka Rinne still in his prime as an elite netminder -- in spite of a statistically up-and-down season -- and as good a defense as there is top to bottom.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub: If the Predators are going to step forward and reward faithful fans with their first-ever deep playoff run, it feels more and more like it would take a bold, out-of-the-box move. Specifically, does general manager David Poile have to consider swallowing hard and trading captain Shea Weber?\n\nA fanciful notion? Perhaps, but consider this: The Predators are in a unique situation with their most valuable asset. Because of the offer sheet Weber signed in 2012 with the Philadelphia Flyers, which the team subsequently matched, Weber does not have trade protection. Poile can do with Weber as he sees fit. Extend him, trade him or invite him to dinner. It is a singular dynamic in an NHL where no-trade and no-move clauses are handed out like candy on Halloween.\n\nAnd what kind of bidding war might ensue for Weber\u2019s services, given that he is under contract at a manageable $7.857 million annual cap hit for the next four seasons? Think of emerging teams that are desperate for defensive help and the kinds of young offensive stars the Predators might receive in return. What about Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Jordan Eberle for Weber? Or Leon Draisaitl instead of Eberle? Would you make either of those deals if you were Oilers GM Peter Chiarelli? Would Poile make that move given how difficult it has been for the team to develop its own scoring stars and how weak it is down the middle?\n\nWeber is the face of this franchise and a unique defensive asset. No question. But equally undeniable is that Roman Josi is a Norris Trophy-caliber defender. And Seth Jones is a rising star with limited potential to grow on the Preds\u2019 current defensive depth chart as he heads toward restricted free agency at the end of the season. Big Mattias Ekholm is an underrated talent who could blossom if the defensive lineup was altered.\n\nWhat about the Columbus Blue Jackets' issues with young star center Ryan Johansen, who was a recent healthy scratch? What about Pittsburgh, where the Penguins are woefully thin on the back end and have high-end talent up front that isn\u2019t producing? Would Evgeni Malkin ever consider a move to the Music City? Since we\u2019re thinking outside the box, what about Sidney Crosby?\n\nIn short, the Predators are one of those rare teams that could trade a player such as Weber and actually get exponentially better if the right parts come back.\n\nMaybe Poile would never in a million years trade his franchise defenseman. But we know Poile is smart and not afraid of a big move, and it does appear that\u2019s what it will take to get this team to the ultimate goal.", "Vyacheslav Glazkov, Charles Martin to fight for vacant heavyweight world title on Jan. 16": "Vyacheslav \"Czar\" Glazkov and Charles Martin will fight for a vacant heavyweight world title on Jan. 16 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, adding a second heavyweight title bout to the Showtime-televised card.\n\nWarriors Boxing, Martin's promoter, won an IBF purse bid on Friday afternoon in Springfield, New Jersey, to win the promotional rights to the bout. Warriors Boxing, with backing from Martin adviser Al Haymon, bid $1.24 million, easily topping a bid of $888,000 from Glazkov promoter Main Events.\n\nPromoter Lou DiBella, who is putting on the Jan. 16 card headlined by heavyweight titlist Deontay Wilder's defense against Artur Szpilka -- two other Haymon clients -- told ESPN.com that he made a deal with Warriors Boxing to add the fight to the show. DiBella also said he is finalizing details with Showtime.\n\nGlazkov, as the higher-ranked contender, is entitled to 65 percent of the winning bid ($804,700), and Martin is entitled to the remaining 35 percent ($433,300). Both purses will be, by far, their biggest paydays.\n\n\"I am looking forward to getting back in the ring and finally getting my opportunity to fight for a world title. I want to thank everyone who helped me get to this place in my career,\" said Glazkov, who became the mandatory challenger for the belt with a disputed decision win against Steve Cunningham in March.\n\nGlazkov, 31, who is from Ukraine but recently relocated to South Florida, was the mandatory challenger for Tyson Fury, who outpointed Wladimir Klitschko in an upset on Nov. 28 to win the lineal world title and three alphabet belts. But when Klitschko exercised his right to an immediate rematch it left Fury unable to make the mandatory defense against Glazkov.\n\nFury, who will make many millions of dollars more for fighting Klitschko again than he would have for a fight with Glazkov, declined the mandatory fight and was stripped by the IBF. That paved the way for contender Charles Martin (22-0-1, 20 KOs) the next leading available contender, to get the fight with Glazkov (21-0-1, 13 KOs).\n\n\"We are thrilled that Czar is getting his world title fight right away and in our own backyard,\" said Glazkov co-promoter Kathy Duva of Main Events, which is based in New Jersey. \"The turnaround is quick, but both fighters will have the same amount of time to prepare so it's fair. On top of fighting for his first world title, Glazkov is going to get more money for this fight than we were offered for any other fight, and we won't be tied to any future options. This is a great deal for everyone involved.\"\n\nAdded Kirill Pchelnikov of Pushka Promotions, Glazkov's co-promoter, \"It does not matter we didn't win the purse bid and it doesn't matter where the fight will be. Maybe next time we will be able to take Glazkov to fight in Russia when he is champion.\"\n\nMartin, 29, of Carson, California, should already be in shape for the fight. He had been training to face 2012 U.S. Olympian Dominic Breazeale on Dec. 12, but when the opportunity to face Glazkov for the belt came up he pulled out a few days ahead of time.\n\n\"I'm happy Warriors won the bid because, obviously, we want to fight sooner than later,\" Mike Borao, Martin's manager, told ESPN.com. \"The winner of the bid isn't as relevant as winning the fight but our side winning the bid helps us stage the fight quickly, which was the preference of Team Martin because he was already in camp for almost eight weeks getting ready for Breazeale.\"\n\nBorao also said that for Martin to get a shot at a world title was especially meaningful in the wake of the May death of Michael King, his former promoter.\n\n\"This is really realizing Michael King's dream,\" Borao said. \"This is everything Michael wanted. It's not only Charles getting this title shot; it's like Michael's too. Charles' career has Michael's fingerprints all over it and we couldn't have gotten here without Michael. I know Charles will win the fight for Michael.\"\n\nDiBella said the addition of a second heavyweight title fight significantly beefs up the show.\n\n\"You have an American, Deontay Wilder, defending his heavyweight world title on the card and now you have another American heavyweight challenging for a vacant title on the card,\" DiBella said. \"There hasn't been a heavyweight title fight in Brooklyn in 115 years and now there will be two on the same night. I think it's exciting.\"\n\nAlthough neither Wilder nor the Glazkov-Martin winner will be recognized as the legitimate heavyweight champion -- that recognition goes to Fury -- the card will have the first heavyweight title bouts in Brooklyn since May 11, 1900, when James J. Jeffries knocked out James J. Corbett in the 23rd round of their scheduled 25-round fight to retain the world title in Coney Island.", "Aroldis Chapman is a good pitcher at a good price for New York Yankees": "ESPN's Andrew Marchand breaks down the Yankees decision to add reliever Aroldis Chapman, especially with a possible suspension looming. (2:58)\n\nThe New York Yankees aren\u2019t looking to make a reclamation project out of Aroldis Chapman. This isn't George Steinbrenner having a soft spot for Doc Gooden or Darryl Strawberry or Billy Martin or even Steve Howe.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not because they think Chapman was unjustly accused of domestic violence by his girlfriend in October, or railroaded by a small-town police force looking to add a big-name notch to its gun belts.\n\nThe Yankees traded for Chapman on Monday for one quite logical reason: Because it was too good a deal to pass up, even if he winds up starting his Yankees career on a suspension of anywhere from 30 to 60 days.\n\nIn fact, it could be the longer the suspension for Chapman, the better it is for the Yankees. But more on that later.\n\nThis was a simple case of the Cincinnati Reds holding a fire sale on a player whose value they apparently feared was about to plummet even further, and the Yankees scooping up a bargain.\n\nYankees GM Brian Cashman has lusted after the fireballing Cuban southpaw for years -- he even tried to get him at last year's trading deadline -- but the price was always too high.\n\nNow, with Chapman under investigation by Major League Baseball for allegedly choking his girlfriend and then firing eight shots from a handgun into some furniture in his garage, the \u201cprice point,\" as Cashman so delicately put it on a Monday night conference call, had been \u201cmodified.\"\n\nSurely, a quartet of minor leaguers -- pitchers Caleb Cotham and Rookie Davis, and infielders Eric Jagielo (a first-round pick for the Yankees in the 2013 draft) and Tony Renda -- was hardly too much to ask for probably the most overpowering relief pitcher in the game.\n\nSure, Cotham showed ability at the big league level and Jagielo and Davis are both highly rated prospects, but none was one of the Yankees' vaunted \u201cuntouchables\" and, as Cashman loves to remind us, being a \u201cprospect\" only means you haven\u2019t done anything yet.\n\nMajor League Baseball is taking a close look at domestic violence allegations against newest Yankees reliever Aroldis Chapman, acquired Monday from the Reds. Jamie Sabau/Getty Images\n\nChapman, on the other hand, had \u201cdeclared himself\" -- another favored Cashman-ism -- over six seasons in which he struck out batters at an alarming rate -- 546 in 319 innings, which translates into more than 15 Ks per nine innings.\n\nMore importantly, his addition to an excellent bullpen that already features Andrew Miller at closer and Dellin Betances as the setup man evokes tantalizing memories of those late '90s Yankees teams that used the trio of Mike Stanton, Jeff Nelson and Mariano Rivera to effectively shorten games to six innings.\n\nEven with a starting rotation riddled with question marks and an offense that relieves heavily on three hitters -- Alex Rodriguez, Mark Teixeira and Carlos Beltran -- more suited to Jurassic Park than Yankee Stadium, having those three arms locked and loaded for the end of a game changes almost everything.\n\nAny game in which the Yankees can coax six innings out of a starter and four or more runs out of their offense is a game they will have a great chance of winning. A similar formula has worked out rather well for the Kansas City Royals, hasn't it?\n\nAnd, by Cashman\u2019s calculation, it might not even matter if the Yankees have to wait until mid-May, or later, to unleash their three-headed bullpen monster.\n\n\u201cTo have Chapman and Miller and Betances is to have a real force at the back end of our bullpen,\" Cashman said.\n\nThere are questions about Chapman\u2019s character and judgment -- according to a source who spoke to ESPN.com on condition of anonymity, Chapman\u2019s 2-year-old baby was in the house at the time he allegedly was shooting up the furniture -- but let\u2019s not get carried away with moralizing about the kind of people who play our games.\n\nIn a perfect world, they would all be model citizens. But in the world we live in, performance always takes precedence over behavior. And in truth, I have no idea whether Chapman is a good guy or a bad guy.\n\nI do know he\u2019s a terrific pitcher, and any baggage that he brings into the Yankees' clubhouse will be their problem, not mine or yours. Brian Cashman is no dope -- he said the Yankees did their \u201cdue diligence, to the best of our ability\" -- and he knows he is taking a calculated gamble by trading for Chapman.\n\nBut it is really a low-risk/high-reward move. If Chapman gets suspended for 30 days, or even 45, the Yankees will still have Betances and Miller to provide a potent 1-2 punch for the first quarter of the season. Chapman\u2019s arrival will be equal to the best midseason bullpen acquisition a team could hope to make.\n\nAnd if baseball decides to bench him for 60 days, that could even work out better for the Yankees. Although it is unclear how many days of service time Chapman needs to qualify for free agency in 2017, it is pretty certain that losing 60 days would delay him from hitting the market for another year. In that case, the Yankees might get the better part of two seasons out of him at a relatively reasonable salary.\n\nBottom line is, the Yankees got a great pitcher and they got him cheap.\n\nAnyway you look at it, it\u2019s a win-win for the Yankees.\n\nOr maybe in the case of Chapman, a save-save.", "U.S.-registered Novo Nordisk to make WorldTour history in 2016": "U.S.-registered Novo Nordisk to make WorldTour history in 2016 By Andrew Hood\n\nPublished Dec. 21, 2015\n\nNovo Nordisk is scheduled to race in the Tour of Poland next summer.

He can box, he can punch, he's exciting. He had the flu all week, but he didn't want to pull out of the fight. He wasn't going to pull out of the fight.\"\n\nOrtiz started very strongly in a huge first round. He drove Jennings into the ropes midway through the round and opened up with a series of shots that caught Jennings and had him wobbly and in trouble. Moments later, a right hand rocked Jennings again. Ortiz also landed a hard right hand to the body and later had Jennings wobbling backward across the ring.\n\nOrtiz picked up where he left off in the second round, hurting Jennings with an uppercut, although Jennings landed an uppercut later in the round for a little get back.\n\nOrtiz had Jennings (19-2, 10 KOs), 31, of Philadelphia, in big trouble again in the third round, hurting him with another uppercut and again with a chopping left hand that had Jennings grabbing onto Ortiz in order to stay upright.\n\nJennings came back nicely in the fourth round to land some heavy shots, although Ortiz didn't budge.\n\nOrtiz (24-0, 21 KOs), 36, again caught Jennings with a huge uppercut late in the fifth round. The crowd gasped, but Jennings surprisingly stayed on his feet. He didn't in the sixth round.\n\nOrtiz nailed Jennings with a massive flush left uppercut, and Jennings went down. It appeared as though the fight would be called, but Jennings got to his knees and impressively beat referee Richard Pakozdi's count. Although Jennings was very shaky, Pakozdi allowed the fight to continue.\n\nBut Ortiz, a southpaw, was all over Jennings, nailing him with a powerful right hand that sent Jennings into the ropes and then landing a left hand that nearly knocked him down again as Pakozdi stepped in to stop it at 2 minutes, 41 seconds.\n\n\"There was a game plan, but when you go up in the ring you have to adapt,\" Ortiz said. \"I told my trainer I saw a lot of flaws in his style and one thing I noticed was he likes to lean forward. I told my trainer after that uppercuts would work.\"\n\nWhen the fight was stopped, Ortiz, known as \"The Real King Kong,\" leaped onto the corner turnbuckle and began beating his chest.\n\nLuis Ortiz revealed after his impressive knockout win on Saturday night that he has been sick with the flu all week. \"I would never do that, pull out of the fight,\" he said through a translator. Ed Diller for ESPN\n\n\"I was a little surprised, but it was a good thing he was able to get up,\" Ortiz said. \"I knew he wasn't right mentally when he got up. I wanted to knock him out, though. I didn't want a TKO. But I did my job. I train hard in the gym and fight hard.\"\n\nJennings was fighting for the first time since going the distance but losing a lopsided decision to Klitschko, then heavyweight champion, on April 25. He took a lot of hard shots from Klitschko and has a reputation for having a solid chin.\n\n\"I think it was me underestimating his pedigree and me thinking that my pressure would [be better than] his pedigree, and he outlasted me,\" Jennings said. \"That's how it was. He was hitting me with clean punches, good punches.\n\n\"I wasn't on my game, and he got the best of me tonight. I should have tried to wear him down earlier.\"\n\nSaid Ortiz, \"[Jennings] is a fighter who deserves much respect. Not everyone goes 12 rounds with Klitschko.\"\n\nOrtiz was making the first defense of the vacant interim belt he won on Oct. 17 by knocking out unknown Matias Ariel Vidondo in three rounds on the Gennady Golovkin-David Lemieux undercard. But he came into that fight and this one with the baggage of testing positive for a banned steroid following a first-round knockout of Lateef Kayode to win the same interim belt in 2014. But that result was erased, and Ortiz was fined and suspended.\n\nOrtiz said he has put the incident behind him and also agreed to undergo rigorous random drug testing, blood and urine, for the fight conducted by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association, the leader in the field.\n\nNow Ortiz, who was a standout amateur in Cuba with a record of 343-19 who defected and now lives in Miami, just wants to continue pursuing his dream.\n\n\"I'm trying to accomplish my dream,\" Ortiz said. \"Ever since I saw my first fight, Muhammad Ali on a small, dingy TV back in Cuba, my dad introduced me to boxing, and my dream has always been to be heavyweight champion.\"\n\nWith his kind of pure power, speed and amateur background, Ortiz could be on his way.\n\n\"We'll go for the biggest fight out there that we can get,\" Gomez said. \"We're willing to fight anybody.\"\n\nSaid Ortiz, \"I don't care who's next.

That's a better fight for Conor. With Dana, we have no idea. There's no rhyme or reason to his madness. But if we're going based on history of the UFC, yes, technically Aldo should get a rematch. You look at Anderson Silva, Cain Velasquez, Renan Barao, Ronda Rousey. Aldo got caught in 13 seconds. Ronda got dismantled for 1.5 rounds. Isn't it a conflict of interest to have UFC brass deciding who's going to be a star, who's going to fight for a title? They're not even basing it on wins and losses anymore. If they want this sport to be taken serious, they need to come up with a formula so it's not just based on how Dana feels about a certain fighter.\n\nOkamoto: I don't like this question because no matter what side I take, I hate my answer. Until last weekend, Aldo had been the best featherweight in the world for basically seven years. He was virtually untouchable. He had a hard-fought battle against Chad Mendes, but in some ways, that only raised his profile -- the fact he would be in such amazing shape and so motivated after years of dominance. Of course this guy deserves a rematch. Previous fallen champs have been granted one for far less. But I, personally, don't want a rematch. At this point, we've had all the Aldo/McGregor feud we can stomach. Buzz around a rematch would be subdued. There wouldn't be much excitement around it. You'd kind of be making a chore out of a UFC title fight. Nobody wants that. For the most part, the UFC does a good job of deciding immediate rematches -- for the most part. They are all case-by-case and, all things considered, no. I just don't think you can do a rematch of this fight right away.\n\n2. If a rematch isn't booked, who should McGregor fight next? Who should Aldo fight next?\n\nLightweight Donald Cerrone's name is being mentioned as a possible next opponent for featherweight champion Conor McGregor. Jeff Bottari/Getty Images\n\nSchaub: I think Conor should fight for the lightweight title if Cowboy Cerrone wins next weekend, I don't think he'll go up to 155 pounds for Dos Anjos. It's a bad matchup. The megafight is Cowboy vs. McGregor. And for Aldo, maybe he goes to 155 pounds and does a superfight with Anthony Pettis? Aldo's issue is that he's not a name. He's kind of a name now after the McGregor fight, but he's one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world and doesn't have the mainstream fights. Not everyone wants to watch him fight, which is a shame. I think (A) he should rush back, and (B) he should get a megafight against Anthony Pettis, which is what he deserves.\n\nOkamoto: For McGregor, it's Frankie Edgar. Regardless of who wins next weekend, my preference is the Edgar fight. And I love the idea of McGregor vs. Cerrone. I have ever since Cerrone stared holes through the back of McGregor's head during a massive UFC news conference in September. But that fight's not going anywhere. Whether it's for a belt or not, the UFC can promote that fight any time. Now is the right time for a featherweight title fight between McGregor and Edgar. One thing a \"champion\" does is take on all comers, and McGregor has the most obvious title contender he could ever wish for in Edgar. That's the fight. And for Aldo, I could not agree more with Schaub. Aldo should finally do what he always teased he would, and that's move up in weight. There is no belt keeping him at 145 anymore. It's a tough weight cut, and there are no big fights left for him there anyway. If Aldo isn't getting a rematch, I want to see him in a matchup that will excite. There are about a billion fun matchups for Aldo at 155 pounds.\n\n3. Should Chris Weidman get an immediate rematch against Luke Rockhold?\n\nChris Weidman had beaten the best fighters the middleweight division had to offer -- until he met Luke Rockhold at UFC 194. Steve Marcus/Getty Images\n\nSchaub: I think so. Weidman has been a champion for a while. He's taken out a lot of guys. I had that fight against Rockhold scored 1-1 going into the third round. I actually thought Weidman was starting to take control before he threw that horrible spinning back kick, which cost him a world championship. If he doesn't throw that kick, how's that fight go down? Also, what are you going to do, give the winner of [Ronaldo] Jacare Souza vs. Yoel Romero the shot? Nobody won that fight. That fight sucked. They both gassed. I scored it a draw. If anything I gave an edge to Jacare. You're not rewarding either one of those guys a title shot after that performance, so the only thing that makes sense is Weidman vs. Rockhold II.\n\nOkamoto: This is a weird one. Souza and Romero were scheduled to fight three times in 2015, with the idea being, \"This will crown the next No. 1 contender at 185 pounds!\" So, the fight finally happens at UFC 194 and, as Schaub accurately pointed out, it kind of sucked. It just wasn't a good showing by either one, and I'm apt to blame that on Romero. Souza got dropped in the first round, and Romero basically stalled from then on. I also scored the fight for Souza, not Romero. If you look at Romero's r\u00e9sum\u00e9, it's worthy of a title shot, but if you've watched it unfold, a Luke Rockhold vs. Yoel Romero middleweight title fight is very \"meh.\" You can't get excited about it after the way Souza/Romero went. All that said, a Weidman rematch doesn't seem like a no-brainer, and the UFC is overloaded with rematches. Do I dare suggest to give the champ who he wants and let Vitor Belfort fight for the title? No, I can't suggest that. I guess a Weidman rematch? If there's a good answer here, it's hiding from me.\n\n4. Should a UFC (or Bellator MMA) champion be allowed to hold belts in multiple weight classes, as McGregor has said he intends to do?\n\nFeatherweight champion Conor McGregor wants to go up in weight but keep his 145-pound title as well. Ed Mulholland for ESPN\n\nSchaub: This is where I put my fighter's hat on. McGregor is in a situation now where he's bigger than the UFC. He's the most famous guy in the world. You see Ireland when he won at the MGM Grand? It was insane. We've never seen anything like it. He's bigger than Brock Lesnar, Ronda -- he's basically Muhammad Ali and he's Irish. Ireland wants a celebrity. McGregor can say, \"I'm not doing s--- until you pay me this amount of money, and I'm going to hold two belts.\" As a fellow fighter who's been through the wringer and knows how this circus works: Conor, don't do anything. You tell them what's going to happen. Now, as a businessman, if you're Dana, you can't have a guy doing that. It's a real issue. What are they going to do at 145 pounds, make an interim belt? It's a real cluster. But as a fighter, I love seeing this. We've never seen anyone like McGregor, and I want him to have full control.\n\nOkamoto: As a fan, I don't want this. It might be one thing if McGregor was bouncing between heavyweight and light heavyweight, pancake-thin divisions with a lack of real contenders. Featherweight and (especially) lightweight are loaded with talent though. As a fan, you want to see both divisions constantly moving, not contenders sitting around while the champ goes off to defend his other belt. And I think McGregor's desire to stay busy enough to defend both is genuine, but realistically, I don't care how good he is, his fights aren't going to be over in the first round. He's going to face adversity, get injured, require time to recover. There is an imbalance of power in this sport between the athlete and promoter, and I'm for seeing that change, but on this specific topic, I would prefer seeing McGregor clean out the featherweight division by fighting Edgar and then vacate if he wants to move up. His financial leverage is now greater than a UFC belt, so even in that sense, I don't think vacating a title hurts his ability to negotiate income.\n\n5. UFC 194 saw several fence-grab situations in Weidman vs. Rockhold and Souza vs. Romero. Are fence grabs a problem that needs to be specifically addressed, or are current rules appropriate?\n\nYoel Romero was warned by referee Marc Goddard for grabbing the fence during his middleweight bout against Ronaldo Souza at UFC 194. Zuffa LLC via Getty Images\n\nSchaub: Fence grabs are a huge problem. In Romero's case, he's not very good off his back. Guess who's phenomenal on top? Jacare. So, would Jacare have finished the fight if Romero hadn't grabbed the fence in that fight? Just to warn a guy doesn't do anything. You have to take a point away. In order to stop guys from doing it, it's just like PEDs. They used to slap guys on the wrist for it. Then the public said, \"What the f---? You can't be doing this.\" So, the UFC went and hired USADA and got serious. Now people are in trouble if they were taking steroids. If you want guys to stop grabbing the fence, you've got to make it a serious and take a point away.\n\nOkamoto: Completely agree. At its highest level, this sport is determined by milliseconds. A fraction of an inch can be the difference between a win and a loss. Take the Romero fight: That fence grab occurred in the second round. Romero ultimately won that round, which was the difference in the fight. Referee Marc Goddard scolded Romero and took away top position from him because he gained it by grabbing the fence. That said, it was still in Romero's best interest to do it! So he loses a top position he got because of the foul. So what? The point of grabbing the fence was to avoid being on his back, and in that sense, it was a complete success! I spoke to Nevada State Athletic Commission executive director Bob Bennett at the end of the night, and he told me officials are supposed to provide a warning for a first offense. My response to that is that warning should take place in the locker room. Fighters know exactly what they're doing when they grab a fence, and commissions are allowing them to get away with it.", "Morning 3-on-3 -- Are the Florida Panthers a playoff team?": "Hot or not\n\nAleksander Barkov, Florida Panthers\n\nBarkov scored a pair of goals, including the game-winner, and finished plus-2 in the Panthers' 3-2 win against the Columbus Blue Jackets.\n\nAnders Nilsson, Edmonton Oilers\n\nNilsson allowed four goals on 30 shots before being pulled after the second period of a 5-3 loss to the Calgary Flames.\n\nAre the Florida Panthers a playoff team?\n\n@ESPN_Burnside: Good morning, and welcome to the Atlantic Division with its new leaders, the Florida Panthers. Nope, that's not a misprint in your NHL standings. By virtue of a 3-2 edging of the Blue Jackets, the Panthers' sixth straight win, Florida has now jumped past Stanley Cup contenders the Montreal Canadiens and Original Six powers the Detroit Red Wings and Boston Bruins to nestle into first place in the Atlantic. Kudos to head coach Gerard Gallant, who gets little recognition for the work he's done with the young Cats (and that one old dude, Jaromir Jagr). Jonathan Huberdeau and Aleksander Barkov combined on two of the three Florida goals Sunday, and Huberdeau is putting a slow start behind him to return to the form that saw him win rookie of the year in the lockout-shortened 2013 season. So, can the Panthers maintain their hold on first place with Montreal in the dumper? Are they a lock to the make the playoffs even though there's still half a season to play? I'm on the Panthers' bandwagon, and I think there's lots of room.\n\n@Real_ESPNLeBrun: I think it's so fascinating to see how the Panthers have meshed some older guys with their emerging young core. Jagr's impact on the young forwards has been clear, but don't forget 36-year-old Roberto Luongo in goal and 38-year-old Willie Mitchell on defense. They're not just important veterans, but they're also playing huge roles. Luongo is still a workhorse at his age and his .924 save percentage is a big reason for the Panthers' success, and Mitchell is playing more than 19 minutes a night. Their leadership and experience have been key in helping Barkov and the kids develop into consistent core players. I'm not ready to say 100 percent that the Panthers are staying in a playoff spot for good, but I think there's a very good chance of it.\n\n@CraigCustance: Florida's run is impressive, but a lock to make the playoffs? Not yet. Look at the Atlantic. The Panthers may be sitting in first now, but they have just a two-point edge on fifth-place Ottawa. I think we're going to see a lot of teams rotate in and out of that top spot in the Atlantic the rest of the season. And I still believe that the Tampa Bay Lightning will end up in a playoff spot, so that means one of those other Atlantic teams will get knocked out. Still, it's one thing to project a team to win games, and quite another to have those wins in their back pocket, which the Panthers now do. I love how they're built. Barkov is such a well-rounded young center. Aaron Ekblad a bona fide franchise defenseman at such a young age. And Luongo is a rock in goal. His December save percentage is .925, a big reason for the wins. They've also been solid defensively in front of him, allowing a total of 33 shots on goal in his past two games. They keep that up, they'll win a lot of games.\n\n@ESPNJoeyMac: No doubt the Panthers are a confident team now. Florida is playing inspired hockey. And while some fans may be surprised by the team's success, there's no denying the talent and ability. A season ago, Panthers veteran forward and two-time Stanley Cup champion Shawn Thornton explained how close Florida was to becoming a real contender. He told me the 2015-16 season would be an eye-opener for a lot of people. The players in that room believe in the team and it's showing in the standings. I'm not saying the Panthers will hold onto the top spot in the Atlantic for the remainder of the season, but they should contend for a postseason spot. Florida's young talent has another season of experience and the veteran core has led the way. At this point, you would also have to consider coach Gerard Gallant as an early candidate for the Jack Adams Award. The Panthers will continue to be an exciting team to watch in the final few months of the season.\n\nAround the league", "Conor McGregor hands down": "ESPN MMA Live Extra's Fighter of the Year Conor McGregor talks about what his win over Jose Aldo means for the UFC and Irish fighting fans. (1:29)\n\nConor McGregor dropped more sound bites in 2015 than perhaps any fighter ever has in a 12-month period.\n\nHe saved one of his best for last. On Dec. 9 in Las Vegas, three days before he would unify the UFC featherweight champion with a 13-second knockout win against Jose Aldo, McGregor (19-2) posed a question.\n\n\"What can [the critics] say after Jose falls?\" McGregor asked.\n\nEditor's Picks Photos: Conor McGregor's record-breaking KO 'The Notorious' Conor McGregor knocked out Jose Aldo in 13 seconds, making him the new featherweight champion at UFC 194.\n\nPhotos: UFC 194 Aldo vs. McGregor The best photos from UFC 194 with a showdown between featherweight contenders Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor. 1 Related\n\nIn combat sports, there is nothing quite like an athlete who talks louder than anyone in the room and backs up every statement he makes. That's what McGregor, 27, did in 2015. A lot of \"trash talk\" seems forced in a sport that is constantly required to sell itself to the public, but there was never anything forced about McGregor's claims. He described exactly how he would knock out Aldo at UFC 194, then proceeded to do so.\n\nAnd boy did the industry respond to McGregor's appeal. Just to name a few of McGregor's accomplishments this year:\n\nThe 13-second knockout over Aldo set a UFC record for fastest finish in a title fight, edging the previous mark of 14 seconds set by Ronda Rousey in February. Aldo had not lost in 10 years.\n\nMcGregor-headlined events set the U.S. record for live gate twice. UFC 189 set a new high in July, bringing in $7.2 million. That record fell five months later, when UFC 194 took in $10.1 million.\n\nJust the weigh-in for UFC 194 drew a (mostly Irish) crowd of 9,000 to the MGM in Las Vegas. According to reports, the weigh-in also drew a live television audience of 294,000 viewers on cable.\n\n\"At 27 years of age, I stand here as the unified world champion,\" said McGregor, following UFC 194. \"Back-to-back gate records at the MGM. This is trending as the highest pay-per-view of all time for UFC. I'm 27 years of age with every record in the book.\"\n\nTwo years ago, McGregor was widely viewed as mostly a talking head. One with a powerful but limited skill set the UFC would need to protect in terms of matchmaking. Today, he's ranked as a pound-for-pound best, with a knockout finish against one of the greatest fighters of his era and a legitimate threat to become only the third man to ever win UFC titles in multiple weight classes. And he is your Fighter of the Year.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\n2. Holly Holm, 3-0 in 2015; Raquel Pennington (SD), Marion Reneau (UD), Ronda Rousey (KO2)\n\nUFC Bantamweight champion Holly Holm ended a great year with a signature victory over former champ Ronda Rousey. Joe Faraoni/ESPN Images\n\nHolm's UFC debut fell short of expectations at UFC 184 in February, as she barely squeaked out a split decision against Raquel Pennington to keep her undefeated MMA record intact. That same night (in the very next fight on the card, actually), Ronda Rousey submitted Cat Zingano in 14 seconds, before a star-strewn Los Angeles crowd. If there was one sentiment after that event it was this: Holm ain't ready for Rousey.\n\nThat was the sentiment again in July, when Holm earned a dominant (but relatively quiet) unanimous decision against Marion Reneau. When the UFC announced Holm would fight Rousey the following month, it felt as if it was way too much, too soon. We all know how that turned out.\n\n3. Rafael dos Anjos, 2-0 in 2015; Anthony Pettis (UD), Donald Cerrone (TKO1)\n\nRafael dos Anjos won all his three times in 2015, including a destruction of Donald Cerrone in December. Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nIn his 18th UFC appearance, Dos Anjos dominated one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the sport in Anthony Pettis to win the UFC lightweight championship. No other champion in UFC history has required that many appearances before winning the belt (and as he later revealed, Dos Anjos won that fight against Pettis with a bum knee). In reality, Dos Anjos \"arrived\" well before this year, but his dominance against Pettis and a 66-second knockout against Donald Cerrone on Dec. 19 have forced him onto everyone's radar. He won't be overlooked in 2016.\n\n4. Joanna Jedrzejczyk, 3-0 in 2015; Carla Esparza (KO2), Jessica Penne (TKO3), Valerie Letourneau (UD)\n\nJoanna Jedrzejczyk was a sensational surprise for the UFC in 2015. Josh Hedges/Getty Images\n\nA popular candidate for Breakout Fighter of the Year in 2014, the Polish 115-pounder followed last year's campaign with a thoroughly dominant run in 2015. Few fans even knew how to pronounce Jedrzejczyk's name coming into the year. Now, some might even be able to spell it. She has been terrific under the spotlight and co-headlined UFC 193 last month, which set a new UFC record for live attendance.\n\n5. Ronda Rousey, 2-1 in 2015; Cat Zingano (Sub1), Bethe Correia (KO1), Holly Holm (KO2 - Loss)\n\nCat Zingano's decision to rush Ronda Rousey at the start of Round 1 ended in a 14-second defeat by armbar. Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nBefore you lose your mind -- you'll put Rousey on any and every list imaginable, just because she's Rousey! -- consider what she did in 2015. She took female MMA, which was already in the UFC solely because of her, to a new level. She drew a combined live audience of 88,591 across three continents, announced a fight on Good Morning America, became the first female athlete to guest host SportsCenter and reportedly headlined the second most-successful pay-per-view in UFC history last month, at the time it aired.\n\nHad McGregor not done what he did at UFC 194, Rousey would have set the record for fastest finish in a UFC title fight this year. She recorded the first one-punch knockout of her career, rendering Bethe Correia unconscious with a right hand. Her comeback story from last month's loss to Holm will be the most-followed plotline of 2016. Knockout loss aside, she was one of the most influential and successful fighters of 2015.", "It's Novak Djokovic and the rest": "The ATP World Tour Finals have come and gone. Once again, the theme was an all-too-familiar one with Novak Djokovic winning another tournament, his fourth straight year-end title.\n\nAfter a sensational week in London, and with a historic Davis Cup final coming up, our writers have a few thoughts to share:\n\nShowing gratitude\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nNic Atkin, ESPN UK: It's a long, grueling season for those playing on the ATP Tour.

A Japanese journalist said \"thank you\" to Djokovic after taking one from the box. Djokovic replied \"arigato\" in kind.\n\nAfter two boxes had run out, Djokovic even handed his own personal energy bar to a journalist who had missed out on the other treats. A touch of class off the court from someone who has shown so much on it this season.\n\nDavis Cup tension\n\nIan Walton/Getty Images\n\nTristan Barclay, ESPN UK: Despite guiding Britain to its first Davis Cup final since 1978, it seems Andy Murray still has a point to prove in some quarters if this weekend's clash with Belgium is to be played.\n\nThe world No. 2 has been accused by former British captain David Lloyd of failing to inspire a future generation of tennis stars. Lloyd claimed that Murray's pair of Grand Slam victories has not been enough to convince kids in the UK to pick up a racket rather than a soccer ball. Winning tournaments, Lloyd said, is no substitute for putting your heart and soul into grassroots tennis.\n\nPosting on Instagram last Sunday, Murray responded, \"Thanks for all the messages of support on social media today and for seeing [Saturday's] criticism for exactly what it was #bitter #backthebrits.\"\n\nFormer players have jumped to Murray's defense, too, with former British No.1 Tim Henman saying others have to take advantage of the interest Murray creates in the game.\n\nMurray mailing it in?\n\nGlyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPeter Bodo, ESPN.com: \"Did he or didn't he?\"\n\nThat's the big question regarding Murray and his failure in the late stages of the ATP World Tour Finals. Full question being: \"Did Murray let his two final round-robin matches get away from him because of Great Britain's critical Davis Cup final at Belgium next weekend?\"\n\nMurray denied that the pending tie in Ghent, Belgium, was a distraction following his straight-set loss to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of round-robin play -- a loss that eliminated Murray from contention. (Murray had been crushed in his previous match by Nadal.)\n\n\"I wanted to try to win the tournament,\" Murray insisted in his postmatch news conference. \"Obviously you have to try your best right way through to the end. It wasn't enough.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Murray has been practicing on clay for the Davis Cup final right up and even during the World Tour Finals, and two weeks before the London shootout of the top eight ATP players, he said he might skip the year-enders entirely in order focus on Davis Cup. It obviously means a great deal to Murray.\n\nGreat Britain hasn't hoisted the Davis Cup since Fred Perry led his squad to triumph in 1936. In other words, this is like Murray winning Wimbledon all over again -- a great feat for a once-great tennis nation that has experienced a long and frustrating dry spell.\n\nOf course, Murray toying with the idea of bypassing the tour's showcase finale meant a great deal to the ATP. You can bet the telephone lines lit up. So Murray did the right thing. He fulfilled his ATP obligation and played, recorded a nice win over David Ferrer, then took his two losses and got the weekend off.\n\nIt would be unfair to question Murray's honesty or integrity. But this is a guy who locked down a career-high ranking of No. 2 this year. It's impossible to imagine that the Davis Cup wasn't on his mind.\n\nThe best rivalry in tennis is ...\n\nAP Images\n\nMatt Wilansky, ESPN.com: The overarching -- make that obvious -- storyline on the men's tour this year was Djokovic. There's no debating that. But there is some dispute as to what the greatest rivalry in tennis is.\n\nWith the ATP World Tour Finals completed, Djokovic is now 23-23 lifetime against Nadal, having beaten the Spaniard in the London semifinals, and 22-22 versus Roger Federer. (They split two matches this past week.) Those are the two most frequent matchups in the Open era.\n\nSo ... which is the better rivalry?\n\nIf the present means anything, Djokovic and Federer played eight times in 2015, with the Serb snaring five of those wins. However, the only real drama-laden match came at the All England Club, where Djokovic won a five-set thriller in the championship match (the second year in a row he thwarted Fed in the fifth set of the Wimby final).\n\nDjokovic and Nadal went head-to-head four times this season, and the Serb swept every set. However, these two have a grueling history.\n\nAt the 2009 Madrid Masters, Djokovic edged out Nadal in a 4-hour, 9-minute three-setter, the longest Masters match ever. And, of course, there was the 5\u00bd-hour Aussie Open final three years ago and the epic semifinal clash that Nadal won at the 2013 French Open.\n\nIt's exhausting just thinking about it.\n\nPerhaps Djokovic himself can distinguish the two rivalries.\n\n\"In terms of matches played, maybe the most exciting matches that I've played maybe the Nadal rivalry would be the one I would pick,\" Djokovic told the media after Sunday's title. \"Again, two different rivalries because two different players.\n\n\"Those two rivalries made me a better player, the player I am today, no doubt. Made me understand what I need to do both on and off the court to be able to be in this position now.\"\n\nDjoker-Federer or Djoker-Nadal. We could parse the numbers for days and not come up with a definitive answer.\n\nLet's just hope these two rivalries don't end anytime soon.", "Ravens' win over Steelers is biggest upset in team history": "The Baltimore Ravens' 20-17 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers is the biggest upset in the Ravens' 20-year existence. At least, by Las Vegas oddsmakers' standards.\n\nThis marked the first time that the Ravens have ever won a game in which they were double-digit underdogs. The Ravens, who were 11.5-point underdogs against Pittsburgh, had been underdogs by 10 points or more in 10 previous games and lost every time, including a 35-6 loss to the Seattle Seahawks earlier this month.\n\nBaltimore players, though, remained confident they could upend their chief rival.\n\n\"This is not even to sound brash, but we believed the whole time that we were going to beat them,\" cornerback Jimmy Smith said. \"It's Pittsburgh.

A lone merchandise seller -- \"grafter\" in Mancunian parlance -- was hawking scarves bearing Mourinho's name and a version of the Manchester United badge.

Two good years and then a blowout in the third?\"\n\nFans don't pretend that the football under Van Gaal is anything but boring, but they also don't like to see a man condemned who enjoyed widespread support only a month ago.\n\nWhile the now infamous Jose Mourinho scarves made the rounds on social media pre-match, they did not generally reflect the mood among Manchester United supporters.\n\nBy the entrance to the Munich tunnel, stewards in bright orange and yellow jackets ushered 3,000 travelling Chelsea fans into their turnstiles to watch their injury- and suspension-hit strugglers. They'd soon be singing \"Jose Mourinho\" in honour of their recently dismissed manager. Security was tight, more so since the terror attacks in Paris.\n\nMembers of United's Disabled Supporters club waited by an entrance close to where executive supporters were greeted by attractive ladies in Manchester United suits. Sean Jeffrey, a 21-year-old with learning disabilities from Hyde near Manchester wondered who would replace Van Gaal, if he were to go. Most United fans did the same. Sean's father was sympathetic. \"Van Gaal doesn't look well, he doesn't need it at his age, it's not fair on him,\" he opined.\n\nA suited Van Gaal made his entrance alongside his team. Like a wounded prizefighter, he was applauded and he waved at the crowd in the South Stand. Twenty-four photographers focused their lenses on the United manager as he took his place on his seat surrounded by fans. Despite many fans wanting a change of manager, there was no hostility, no season tickets hurled in frustration.\n\nNot for the first time this season, United started brightly, with Juan Mata striking the crossbar with a second-minute shot. He'd been set up by Wayne Rooney, recalled after being a substitute in the previous game, a defeat at Stoke. The noise increased, and fans who'd been singing for Van Gaal in the Stretford End hollered about following United. Their team showed a purpose that had been lacking, though John Terry's fourth-minute header was goalbound until United goalkeeper David De Gea tipped it over. At least it was exciting.\n\nEmbattled Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal was optimistic before Monday's clash with Chelsea.\n\n\"Viva John Terry!\" sang the Stretford End, serenading the Chelsea captain with their song celebrating his penalty slip in the 2008 European Cup final between the clubs. In the match programme, former United captain Nemanja Vidic recalled that game seven years ago when the pair were the best teams in the world.\n\n\"Chelsea were the team who pushed us, and we pushed them,\" the Serb said. \"We drove each other on. In the league, in the cups, in Europe.\"\n\nOn current form, both sides are far from being England's best, let alone continental or world beaters, but United did show an urgency that has been lacking for most of this season in a very bright opening half hour.\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin's ninth-minute shot rasped wide of Thibaut Courtois' goal, prompting more chants of \"Louis van Gaal's red and white army\" in J Stand.\n\nThere was further promise and evidence that confidence wasn't entirely depleted in the United ranks when Anthony Martial's shot struck the inside of the post. A 28th-minute Rooney shot from distance drew another save from the Belgian.\n\n\"It's so quiet, Old Trafford,\" chorused the visiting fans during a brief lull. They also chided United fans for playing their European football on Thursday evening for the rest of the season after Champions League elimination.\n\n\"Going down,\" responded the home hordes.\n\n\"Campeones,\" hit back the fans in blue, bringing a riposte of \"20 times\" to celebrate United's record 20 league titles. This was the terrace tribalism of English football at its finest, the mood bolstered by the performance of the home team. It was encouraging, but without a goal their confidence always appeared fragile, the attack still lacking a killer instinct.\n\nAt the start of the second half, De Gea made a double save from Pedro and then Cesar Azpilicueta. At the other end, Courtois saved from Ander Herrera from close range after Martial had crossed.\n\nManchester United played some of their best football in weeks, but were still unable to find a way past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.\n\nNeither team could score. When Chelsea counterattacked on the hour after Pedro put Nemanja Matic through with only De Gea to beat, the champions looked sure to go ahead and sink United's confidence. Instead, the Serb skied his shot into a sea of waving, mocking arms. Chelsea were without a striker, and it showed.\n\nUnited's early flourish faded and gave way to their mundane usual selves, albeit with more attacking intent. Their conservatism unshackled, they played like a side who weren't used to playing in this way. United gave the ball away, they conceded foul throws and made unforced errors. They moved the ball too slowly, misjudged movement and, most importantly, failed to score again.\n\nWhen the stadium announcer indicated a minimum of three minutes of added time, the announcement wasn't greeted with primal screams for United to attack. Instead, there was weariness from fans watching their side draw 0-0 at home for the sixth time in 15 games this season. They hoped for more, but, when it mattered, their team didn't have the players capable of breaking down an injury-hit side who sit 15th. There were muted jeers and applause at the end from a minority. The rest trudged away reluctantly into an unseasonably mild northern English night.\n\n\"I see the Stretford End arising, I see there's trouble on the way,\" sang the residents of the famous stand during the game. A defeat and there would have been more trouble, but Van Gaal's side showed enough promise for him to fight another day.\n\nAndy Mitten is a freelance writer and the founder and editor of United We Stand.

Inoue, making the first defense of the belt he won last Dec. 30 with a shocking second-round wipeout of Omar Narvaez, missed most of 2015 because of a severe injury to his right hand against Narvaez.\n\nOn the undercard, Javier Mendoza (24-2-1, 19 KOs) will make the second defense of his junior flyweight belt when he faces Akira Yaegashi (22-5, 12 KOs), a former strawweight and flyweight titleholder who has been in some excellent scraps, including a 10th-round knockout win against Porsawan Porpramook to win a strawweight title in the 2011 ESPN.com fight of the year.\n\nThat card will set the stage for a busy New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nIn Tokyo, junior lightweight titleholder Takashi Uchiyama (23-0-1, 19 KOs), fighting on his fifth New Year\u2019s Eve in a row, will make the 11th defense of his belt when he takes on Oliver Flores (27-1-2, 17 KOS). A victory could propel Uchiyama into a defense against Nicholas Walters in the United States in 2016.\n\nIn the co-feature junior flyweight titlist Ryoichi Taguchi (22-2-1, 9 KOs) will make his second defense when he squares off with Luis De La Rosa (24-5-1, 14 KOs).\n\nIn Osaka, flyweight titleholder Kazuto Ioka (18-1, 10 KOs) will make his second defense when he meets former titleholder Juan Carlos Reveco (36-2, 19 KOs) in a rematch. Ioka won the belt from Reveco via majority decision on April 22, also in Osaka, Ioka's hometown.\n\nThe card also will feature strawweight titlist Katsunari Takayama (30-7, 12 KOs) making his third defense when he takes on Jose Argumedo (15-3-1, 9 KOs). In August 2014, Takayama lost a decision to Francisco Rodriguez Jr. in a strawweight title unification fight that was the ESPN.com fight of the year.\n\nAnd in Nagoya, fans will ring in the new year when strawweight titlist Kosei Tanaka (5-0, 2 KOs), who is only 20, makes the first defense of the belt he won in May when he faces Vic Saludar (11-1, 9 KOs). When Tanaka outpointed Julian Yedras to win vacant belt in only his fifth professional fight he set the Japanese record for winning a world title in the fewest number of fights. The record previously was held by Inoue, the prodigy who claimed a junior flyweight world title in his sixth pro fight in April 2013.", "Mike Mussina one of the casualties of a broken Hall of Fame voting process": "Insider\n\nMike Mussina retired after the 2008 season nearly at the top of his game. Despite a 20-win season, his first in the majors, a more-than-respectable 3.37 ERA, his seventh Gold Glove and a sixth-place finish in the American League Cy Young race, Mussina called it a career at the age of 39. The next step for a pitcher who has Mussina's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is typically a July speech in upstate New York. But in this case, he has struck out with Hall of Fame voters to the same degree that batters used to flail at his trademark knuckle-curve. And, unfortunately, the third time on the Hall ballot doesn't appear to be the charm.\n\nThe stunning thing about Mussina's case to make the Hall of Fame is how easy it is to support using either traditional statistics or modern analytics. Mussina is not Cy Young and he's not Greg Maddux, but the Hall of Fame hasn't been made up of players you can argue to be the best of all time at their position since the first couple of years.\n\nEditor's Picks From The Mag: Why every HOF voter should cast a vote for Raines Mag columnist Peter Keating explains why Tim Raines' stats, and not the vials of cocaine he kept on him during games, should be the only thing Hall of Fame voters consider.\n\nHall of Fame update: Nobody loves Jim Edmonds After looking at some early returns, it's apparent that Hall of Fame voters are overlooking some strong seasons from Jim Edmonds. 1 Related\n\nMussina finished his career with 270 wins, and while I personally go for the more analytical case, pitchers with 270 wins tend to end up in the Hall of Fame. Starting with the modern era's typical boundary of 1901 -- baseball's competition was inconsistent in early decades -- Mussina's 270 wins is the fourth-most of any non-Hall of Fame pitcher. One of those pitchers is Roger Clemens, who is outside of the Hall for reasons that have nothing to do with his career performance. The other two, Tommy John and Jim Kaat, were more accumulators than Mussina ever was: Kaat had 13 more wins in 89 more starts than Mussina; for John, those numbers are 18 and 164. That's not just due to team quality either -- Mussina's career ERA+ of 123 (a measure of park-neutral ERA relative to league, with 100 being average) is more impressive than Kaat's 108 or John's 111.\n\nIn other words, if you only go by traditional stats, wins and ERA, Mussina is the best pitcher not in the Hall of Fame who doesn't have any PED issues.", "Where could the New York Yankees' new relief trio rank all time?": "It\u2019s easy to get excited about what adding Aroldis Chapman to a New York Yankees bullpen already boasting Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances might do. Among pitchers throwing 50 or more innings in 2015, Chapman\u2019s whiff rate of 41.7 percent ranked tops in the majors, with Miller\u2019s 40.7 percent ranking third and Betances\u2019 39.5 percent ranking fourth. Put that on paper on one team, and you can already forecast gale-force winds from the seventh inning on in Nu-Yankee Stadium next year.\n\nComing as it does on the heels of the Kansas City Royals' World Series win, it\u2019s easy to characterize this as a smart compensation for where the game is today. Deep bullpens can shorten the game by effectively limiting opposing offenses to early scoring opportunities, and overpowering bullpens can effectively take control of the game without relying heavily on the defense behind them. A deep, overpowering bullpen also makes for a great way of offsetting a fragile, shallow or aging rotation -- something the Yankees are only too familiar with.\n\nSo now that the Yankees have three of the best whiff artists of 2015 queued up to pitch out of their bullpen in 2016, let\u2019s indulge ourselves with a question: If these three were to repeat their 2015 performances in 2016, where would they rank among other great bullpen trios of the past for their ability to blow batters out of the box?\n\nUsing strikeouts per nine innings (K/9) and strikeout percentage (K%), then indexing the latter number against their league\u2019s average (or what I call K Ratio on the table below), I came up with a quick-and-dirty way to compare Chapman, Betances and Miller\u2019s collective 2015 performance to the great bullpen threesomes of the recent Royals, the 2010 San Francisco Giants, the 2003 Houston Astros, the late-'90s Yankees and the 1990 Cincinnati Reds. These are just the teams that quickly came to mind for reasons I\u2019ll get into, though no doubt there are a few others worthy of consideration. But with that non-scientific disclosure in mind, let\u2019s put the Yankees of tomorrow up against some of baseball's great three-headed hydras of late-game doom:\n\nMLB's most dominant relief trio? If the Yankees' new late-game combo of Aroldis Chapman, Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances repeat their 2015 performances, they could be in the conversation. Team K/9 K% K Ratio 1990 Reds 11.6 30.4 201 1997 Yankees 9.1 24.0 147 2003 Astros 10.4 29.0 170 2010 Giants 10.3 28.0 146 2014 Royals 11.4 32.1 158 2016 Yankees? 14.7 40.5 199 K Ratio is the ratio of the trio's whiff rate compared to league average; 100 = average.\n\nThe 2014-15 Royals: What buoyed the Royals' resilient offense as it generated all of those late-game comebacks? A bullpen that throttled the life out of opposing offenses, headlined by closer Greg Holland and setup men Wade Davis and Kelvin Herrera. With two pennants and a World Series win in the past two seasons, we can present the Royals as the reigning paradigm for the benefits of a bullpen that effectively limits opposing scoring opportunities to the first six innings. For this exercise, let\u2019s use their best year, 2014. That season, they combined to whiff 11.4 men per nine innings, with a 32.1 percent whiff rate. Awesome, yes, and ultimately rewarded by a title this year, but their performance is also a cut below what the Yankees of 2016 might -- key word, might -- have on tap. However, their 1.28 ERA might be close to impossible to put in the shade. And flags fly forever.\n\nThe 2010 Giants: With Sergio Romo, Santiago Casilla, Jeremy Affeldt and (at least in 2010) Brian Wilson, you could make an argument that the Giants\u2019 tally of three World Series wins in the past five years owes much to strong late-game combinations, even as the detail over who ends up getting the saves in any individual season might be more cause for concern for agents and fantasy league GMs. If we\u2019re going to include the Giants\u2019 most dominant bullpen iteration, we\u2019d probably have to tab the 2010 team\u2019s reliance on Wilson closing (while putting baseball beards over the top and beyond the collar), set up by Romo all year and Casilla after the former Athletic was resurrected in May with more heat on his fastball and flashing a new, sharp curve. As a group they were good, to be sure, striking out 28 percent of opposing batters while combining for a 1.97 ERA. And they won it all.\n\nThe 2003 Astros: OK, somebody on this list has to have not won it all, and these Astros fell a game short of reaching the postseason, where they would have been scary. But it\u2019s also hard to overlook a team that simultaneously employed Billy Wagner as closer, set up by Octavio Dotel in his prime and closer-to-be Brad Lidge. Combined, that trio whiffed 299 of the 1,030 batters it faced, a workload spread evenly and effectively among the three. As you can see from the table, they\u2019re among the most dominant relief groups ever, but they\u2019re not tops when it comes to dominance dealt from the mound.\n\nThe 1997-2000 Yankees: While Mariano Rivera is part of the iconic Core Four of the most recent Yankees dynasty, he was also the front man of a power relief trio, teaming up with Jeff Nelson and Mike Stanton to give the Yankees a stable late-game combo during their last dynastic run when they three-peated from 1998 to 2000. Ironically, their best season as a trio was 1997, the year the Yankees didn\u2019t win it all, but I\u2019m sure they consoled themselves with the rings they won the next three seasons.\n\nWhen it comes to fireballing firemen, the Reds' famed Nasty Boys -- Rob Dibble, Randy Myers and Norm Charlton -- are tough to top. AP Photo/Al Behrman\n\nThe 1990-91 Reds: Rob Dibble and lefties Randy Myers and Norm Charlton, all of them equipped with overpowering stuff, and all of them talented enough to close. In the Reds\u2019 championship season in 1990, the Nasty Boys struck out 291 men in 225 1/3 relief innings, or a strikeout rate of 11.6 K/9. Equally impressive is that, since the NL strikeout rate in 1990 was just 15.1 percent, coming out of the pen this trio was striking out more than twice the league\u2019s average by whiffing 30.4 percent of all batters faced. If you define dominance through the ability to overpower people at the plate, that\u2019s close to impossible to top.\n\nHowever, one interesting thing to keep in mind about this combo is that Dibble, Charlton and Myers never enjoyed the benefit of a full season together in the bullpen. Charlton became a starter again in mid-July in 1990, taking 16 turns to help shore up the rotation, then opened 1991 with 11 more starts before an injury in June encouraged a permanent move back to the bullpen in the second half, and Myers made the only 12 starts of his big league career in the second half of 1991 before departing as a free agent. Of course, you could also say the 1989 Reds bullpen was pretty nasty, too, before Cincinnati traded closer John Franco to the Mets to get Myers, creating the trivia that the 1989-1991 Reds had three different 30-save closers (Franco, Myers and Dibble).\n\nOK, so where would a Chapman-Miller-Betances combo rank among these overpowering bullpen trios? Considering we\u2019re talking about a bullpen that hasn\u2019t actually suited up together, let alone pitched together -- and comparing it to groups that did and delivered -- I\u2019d favor the Nasty Boys, for pure dominance, especially compared to the standards of their day. And yes, even though they didn\u2019t get the benefit of a full season together, and even though they won just one World Series, striking people out in today's day and age is much more likely, so, to make an apples-to-apples comparison, you need to allow for how dominant a relief crew was relative to its direct competition.\n\nIf that strikes you as unfair, just remember that\u2019s more than the 2016 Yankees have achieved -- or might ever achieve, especially if the discipline Chapman receives over his alleged domestic abuse shelves him for a considerable length of time. But just to be able to put this new Yankees combo into that conversation? It\u2019s certainly fun to think about, and in 2016 we'll get to see whether these three can live up to it.\n\nChristina Kahrl writes about MLB for ESPN.

Will Serena maintain her WTA dominance? And will Andy Murray's momentum continue into the 2016 Slam season? Our experts weigh in on these issues and more.\n\nAndy Murray will parlay his Davis Cup championship into at least one Grand Slam title in 2016.\n\nJordan Mansfield/Getty Images for LTA\n\nBodo: False. Winning the Davis Cup in 2010 was clearly a springboard for Novak Djokovic's three-Slam performance in 2011. The thing is, Andy Murray is not Djokovic, and he's not at a comparable stage of his career. The problem for Murray is he isn't the superior player at any of the majors, partly because he's a better three-set than five-set performer. Barring a major, unexpected upset or two at a Grand Slam event, Murray simply isn't consistently good enough to hammer his way through to the championship.\n\nGarber: True. It's been a while since he won his two previous majors -- the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon -- but as his Davis Cup triumphs prove, he can still find the fire. Next year, he'll put a lot less energy into Davis Cup and more into the Grand Slams. I don't think it's a stretch to see him winning either Wimbledon or the US Open again.\n\nIsaacson: True. It's as good a time as any, since Murray is physically fit, had as consistent a 2015 season as he ever has, and is riding some pretty decent momentum. He said he's gunning for the two Slam titles he hasn't yet won -- the Australian and French Opens -- and he was close in both in 2015, losing to Novak Djokovic twice (in the finals in Melbourne and semis in Paris). Fatherhood (in February) could inspire him. If he doesn't win one in 2016, it will be a disappointment for the world No. 2.\n\nNovak Djokovic will win at least three of the big five events in 2016 (including the Olympics).\n\nJulian Finney/Getty Images\n\nBodo: True. Now that Djokovic has 10 majors, he'll be super motivated to catch Rafael Nadal's 14 and perhaps even Roger Federer's record 17. Time is on the 28-year-old Djokovic's side. Federer is 34. Nadal struggled through 2015 and didn't even make a major semifinal. Djokovic is 21-9 against his true generational rival, Murray, having prevailed in nine of their past 10 matches. And Djokovic is an overpowering 19-4 against two-time Slam winner Stan Wawrinka. Three of the big five events of 2016 will be on hard courts, including the Rio Olympics. Djokovic could win them all -- and more.\n\nGarber: False. The past three times a man has won three of the four majors (Roger Federer in 2007, Rafael Nadal in 2010 and Djokovic in 2011), he followed that up by reaching three Grand Slam singles finals the following year -- and winning only one. The triple-Slam effort simply takes too much out of the body and mind. The Olympics make this one interesting; I can see a scenario in which Murray, Nadal and a surprise mystery guest (Milos Raonic, Kei Nishikori, Grigor Dimitrov?) win three of the five big titles.\n\nIsaacson: False. I want to say true, merely because of how much he looked to want payback after reluctantly playing the evil role to Fed's good in September's US Open final. I also want to say yes because he was so dominant in 2015. But if the Open showed us anything, it's that even Djokovic can be vulnerable at times, and with the Olympics thrown in, it's tough to imagine he will have the mental and physical stamina to pull off three of the big five.\n\nRafael Nadal is more likely than Roger Federer to win a Grand Slam in 2016.\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nBodo: False. No disrespect to Nadal who's been down on his luck, but in 2015, he left Federer all alone on the \"Stop Djokovic\" bandwagon. Throw in Nadal's nagging health issues, ranging over time from bad knees to a sore back to a bad elbow to a bad wrist, and it's obvious his two priorities for the new year will be finding -- and maintaining -- his vanished consistency and remaining healthy. Sure, he could win the French Open for a 10th time, but based on what we saw in 2015, he will have enough trouble doing that -- never mind any of the other majors.\n\nGarber: True. It was terrific to see Federer get the finals at Wimbledon, the US Open and the Barclays in London. But at age 34, he just doesn't have the stuff to take down an in-form Djokovic. Rafa had some pep in his step in London, and even though he failed to win a major for the first time in 11 years, he will rebound with his 10th French Open title next spring.\n\nIsaacson: True. This is not to say that either Rafa or Fed will win a Slam in 2016; I don't think they will. But Nadal may be slightly more likely, if only because as much as 2015 seemed to signal the beginning of the end, he is not looking presently like a man who wants to retire very soon. He reached the finals in Beijing and Basel, beat Wawrinka and Murray in the ATP Finals round-robin, and is much healthier than he has been recently. A Slam in '16 is not inconceivable.\n\nSerena Williams will end 2016 as the world No. 1.\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nBodo: True. Serena Williams is due for a big letdown after her spectacular 2015. So what? The rest of her WTA peers amply demonstrated that none of them has the chops, or the game, to step in and dominate. That means Serena could have an off year and still end up No. 1. Her most dangerous challenger at the moment appears to be No. 3 Garbine Muguruza. But it's not at all certain that the 22-year-old has the consistency to play at an elite level week in, week out.\n\nGarber: True. At the moment, Serena is nearly 3,900 points ahead of the No. 2-ranked Simona Halep. Even if she takes a predictable step backward from her wondrous 2015 season, Serena has enough of a cushion to stay at No. 1.\n\nIsaacson: True. Virtually every time we count her out, she surprises us, and as far away from tennis as she seems to be right now, Serena still has the capability to hold onto that ranking, if nothing else. She has plenty of points to defend next year, but she also has a huge head start on the rest of the pack.\n\nVenus Williams will finish 2016 in the top 10.\n\nZhong Zhi/Getty Images\n\nBodo: True. Venus Williams had a great 2015, finishing No. 7. Expect more of the same in 2016. She's 35, but that's not an overwhelming handicap in today's game. The grind is easier for her to bear as long as her sister Serena is around. The two love playing doubles together. And the Olympics mean a lot to both Williams sisters. That will motivate Venus in the early part of 2016 because staying in the top eight will guarantee her critical seeding advantages. Her health could be the determining factor in her status.\n\nGarber: False. While it was great to see Venus go 41-13 this year, win three titles and $2.4 million, and finish at No. 7, there are a handful of far younger players lurking just behind her. Karolina Pliskova, Timea Bacsinszky, Carla Suarez Navarro, Belinda Bencic and Madison Keys would love to vault over Venus. Plus, Caroline Wozniacki -- outside the top 15 for the first time in eight years -- is due for a better season.\n\nIsaacson: True. This is a tough one because Venus popped back into the top 10 in 2015 for the first time in four years. It was no fluke in a year made up mostly of bad draws -- she was in Serena's half in every major -- and Venus finished the year with two titles in the China swing, and her best overall season since 2007. Even with the Karolina Pliskovas and Timea Bacsinszkys of women's tennis bearing down on the top 10, there is room for a motivated Venus to hang in.", "Tiger Woods looks to put 'tough year' behind him as he hopes for better health in 2016": "Tiger Woods said he is looking forward to putting a \"tough year'' behind him and expressed hope that he could be healthy and competitive in 2016.\n\nIn a year-end post on his website, Woods offered no hint about his return but also sounded more positive about a comeback than he did three weeks ago during a news conference at the Hero World Challenge.\n\nWoods twice has had surgery on his back in the past three months.\n\nTiger Woods is looking forward to a better and healthier 2016 after enduring what he called a \"tough year\" in 2015.

I've had two back surgeries since then, so it's been a roller-coaster ride the entire year, from being down to some pretty darn good highs.''\n\nWoods had back surgery on March 31, 2014, then had his worst season as a pro in 2015, missing cuts in three consecutive majors.\n\nHe had a second surgery on Sept. 16 and then another surgery on Oct. 28. During a Dec. 1 news conference in the Bahamas, Woods said there was \"no light at the end of the tunnel'' in regards to beginning rehabilitation and a return to golf.\n\nWoods in his post Tuesday again said he hopes to qualify for the 2016 U.S. Ryder Cup team but is excited regardless about the opportunity to be a vice captain to Davis Love III.\n\n\"Where do I see myself in the next five to 10 years?'' Woods wrote. \"I am still playing golf at the highest level and winning tournaments and major championships.''", "Isaiah Thomas, Celtics focused for Kobe Bryant's final game in Boston": "BOSTON -- When Isaiah Thomas joined the Boston Celtics after being acquired at February's trade deadline, he did so in Los Angeles, where he sheepishly admitted his father was a die-hard fan of the Lakers, the team that Thomas would make his Boston debut against later that night.\n\nAnd while Thomas was raised 1,000 miles north of Los Angeles in Tacoma, Washington, he was subject to a steady diet of purple and gold during his formative basketball years. Noted Thomas, \"I was brainwashed to be a Lakers fan when I was young, so I grew up on Kobe Bryant and he was my favorite player.\"\n\nBryant is scheduled to make the final visit of his 20-year career to TD Garden on Wednesday night when the Celtics host the Lakers. Raised on Kobe, Thomas was asked what he thinks it will mean for Bryant to play his final game in Boston.\n\n\"He's the best player to ever play the game of basketball in my era. It\u2019s going to be probably a little emotional for him. This is one of the most famous arenas,\" Thomas said. \"It\u2019s going to suck to see him go. But, at the same time, if it was the other way around, he wouldn\u2019t care if it was your last game, so we gotta try to get the win and don\u2019t let him have a big game.\"\n\nFor the Celtics, there are no remaining players from either the 2008 or 2010 teams that danced with Bryant and the Lakers in the NBA Finals. The last of those players, Rajon Rondo, was shipped out last December, a short time after a much-publicized breakfast with Bryant in Boston.\n\nNow, the Celtics' locker room is filled with players in their early-20s, many of whom were barely old enough to dribble a basketball when Bryant made his NBA debut. Like Thomas, they grew up watching Bryant and likely mimicked him on their local playgrounds.\n\nKobe Bryant will play his final game in Boston on Wednesday night. Troy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"He\u2019s probably the best player in my era, so it speaks for itself what the NBA is going to miss,\" said Jae Crowder, who will be part of the group tasked with defending the 37-year-old Bryant. \"I\u2019m sure the TD Garden will give him a good welcome. I think he\u2019s going to play well. I think he\u2019s going to come out and try to play his best and remember a lot of tough battles here in his career, so we\u2019re prepared for him. We\u2019re prepared for the Lakers.\"\n\nMarcus Smart, another of Boston's perimeter defenders likely to draw time on Bryant, was 3 years old when Bryant made his NBA debut in 1997.\n\n\"It was crazy watching Kobe and the things that he accomplished,\" Smart said. \"He took a beating day in and day out, night after night. It's definitely going to be a fun night Wednesday.\"\n\nEvan Turner playfully barked when asked if he was a fan of Bryant growing up.\n\n\u201cThat's the stupidest question you could have asked,\" Turner said. \"I'm joking. Of course, man. I remember being 8 years old watching [Bryant win] the [1997] dunk contest. I pretty much spent my whole life watching him play. Kobe\u2019s always a bright spot of my adolescence and the game in general.\"\n\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens, who is less than two years older than Bryant, has a deep appreciation for Bryant despite coaching against him only once. Bryant scored 22 points in Boston's 113-96 triumph at TD Garden last December.\n\n\"Obviously, I\u2019m a basketball fan so I have a great deal of respect for him,\" Stevens said. \"I hear the players talk about him as a guy they\u2019ve looked up to and that they\u2019ve studied and that they\u2019ve tried to learn as much as they can from. Hats off to him for having a great career and for going out the way that he wants to. He\u2019ll certainly get a lot of applause along the way over the next couple of months. And deservedly so.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to see exactly how Boston fans respond to Bryant's final visit. New England sports fans typically have a deep appreciation for those that transcended the game, but Bryant is also a villain who denied the Celtics another banner in 2010. The guess here is that fans will salute Bryant for his contributions, but probably spend most of the night booing him.\n\nAs Thomas noted, the Celtics can't get too sentimental about Bryant's visit. Boston is riding a season-high four-game winning streak, and the focus must be on continuing to play well. The Lakers sit in the basement of the Western Conference and own the second-worst record in basketball.\n\nWhile aware of the significance of Bryant's final game in Boston, these Celtics would prefer this just be another quiet night on the farewell tour.", "Caballero set for return after being stripped of world title": "Former bantamweight titleholder Randy Caballero will face Ruben Garcia (15-1-1, 6 KOs), 22, of Mexico, on Feb. 5 (Estrella TV) at the Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, California, where Caballero has fought most of his fights, Golden Boy Promotions announced on Friday.\n\nCaballero (22-0, 13 KOs), 25, of Coachella, California, is moving up to junior featherweight for the 10-round bout after being 5\u00bd pounds overweight and getting stripped of his world title before his initial defense against England's Lee Haskins on Nov. 21 on the Miguel Cotto-Canelo Alvarez undercard. The fight was canceled.\n\n\"I was devastated that I was unable to defend my championship title in Las Vegas on Nov. 21, but I\u2019m determined to come back better than ever in 2016,\" Caballero said. \"Between [foot surgery] and the unfortunate way my body responded before the weigh-in in Las Vegas when I was set to defend my title for the first time, I am looking forward to putting 2015 behind me and starting fresh in the new year. Losing the title was not something I wanted to happen, and I\u2019m motivated more now than ever before to show everyone that I am still a championship fighter in the ring.\"\n\nGolden Boy CEO Oscar De La Hoya said he believes Caballero can get his career back on track.\n\n\"Golden Boy Promotions is behind Randy Caballero 100 percent, and we are pleased that he will return to the ring on Feb. 5,\" De La Hoya said. \"Randy had a rough year in 2015, but I know 2016 will be an opportunity for him to start fresh and remind everyone that he is a talented fighter with a bright future ahead of him in this sport.\"\n\nBecause of the Nov. 21 fight being canceled and foot surgery, Caballero has not boxed since he won a vacant title against Stuart Hall in October 2014.", "NHL -- Seven most influential changes of 2015": "In many ways, hockey stayed the course in 2015. Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin were great. The Chicago Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup. Canada captured both the IIHF World Championships and World Junior Championships. The world kept on turning.\n\nAt the same time, a number of innovative decisions this past year defied hockey conventions. Some of them made major waves, while others barely registered. Nevertheless, they could all affect the sport for years to come.\n\n\"There's a lot of ways to preserve the traditional integrity of our game, but you can also compliment that and augment that with new things that amplify our game,\" said former NHL goalie and current broadcaster Kevin Weekes. \"Our game is incredible, but we just had our 98th birthday. How do we have another incredible 98 years? That's really the line of thinking that some of our more creative thinkers are in to.\"\n\nOnly time will tell which of these decisions prove most influential. In the meantime, we'll just have to watch closely to find out what kind of new standard these moves establish. And that should be the fun part. Here are the seven most influential decision of 2015.\n\n3-on-3 overtime: This was without a doubt the major innovation entering the season. It's not exactly reinventing the game, but the results have been undeniable. Shootouts have been reduced, while fans have been treated to a new breakneck in-game situation. Oh, and many players publicly despise it while the Vancouver Canucks have admitted to playing the extra frame just to get to the shootout.\n\nBut overall fan response has been overwhelmingly positive to what is essentially a hockey video game come to life. Considering some of the indelible back-and-forth 3-on-3 moments fans have enjoyed, the league appears to have struck oil with its newest innovation. Sure, players will continue hating it, at least until the league introduces one-on-one overtime.\n\nPlaying in Switzerland this season has allowed Auston Matthews to develop his game in a way he might not have in college. Sparta Prague/Champions Hockey League/Getty Images\n\nAuston Matthews goes to Switzerland: It's simple, really. The most direct path to the NHL has always gone through either major junior hockey in Canada or Division I college hockey in the United States. But Auston Matthews, the anticipated top pick in the 2016 draft, took a drastic detour when he skipped North America entirely and signed with ZSC Lions of the Swiss League.\n\nPlaying with professionals in Europe, the Arizona product could end up being a trailblazer. He has definitely done nothing to diminish his draft stock. Though he's been slowed by injuries, Matthews, 18, has registered 14 goals and 25 points in 22 games and secured his place as the world's top draft-eligible prospect entering the World Juniors in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nArtemi Panarin is going like gangbusters in his first season for the Blackhawks. Bruce Bennett/Getty Images\n\nThe Blackhawks raid Europe: It was a familiar offseason for the Chicago Blackhawks. Win the Stanley Cup, realize an untenable salary-cap situation, trade and let go of several core players and then scramble to rejigger a championship roster.\n\nSure, their American Hockey League affiliate in Rockford offered replacements. But more drastic moves were required once the Blackhawks parted ways with a number of core players from its 2015 playoff run, including Patrick Sharp, Johnny Oduya, Brad Richards and Brandon Saad.\n\nThat meant looking to Europe and aggressively luring talent from other leagues in a way not seen before, especially from a reigning Cup champion. In came Artemi Panarin and Viktor Tikhonov from the Kontinental Hockey League, and Erik Gustafsson from the Swedish elite league. Add Dennis Rasmussen and Viktor Svedberg, both undrafted free agents previously signed from Sweden, and there was a formidable group of European FAs on Chicago's roster this season.\n\nTikhonov was eventually placed on waivers, but Panarin turned out to be a gem, registering 31 points in his first 35 games and finding chemistry playing beside Patrick Kane.\n\nKari Lehtonen and Antti Niemi have formed a dynamic duo. Getty Images\n\nDallas adopts a two-goalie system: With the likes of Carey Price, Henrik Lundqvist and Braden Holtby continuing to dominate, teams aren't about to stop building around a single workhorse goalie. But the Dallas Stars are making a compelling case for the two-goalie alternative.\n\nGeneral manager Jim Nill raised eyebrows when he signed established goaltender Antti Niemi to a three-year deal despite already having Kari Lehtonen firmly established in net and signed through 2018.\n\nMaybe it was diplomacy at work, as Finnish countrymen shared the crease. Maybe it's the comfort of having one of the most impressive lineups in the league. Whatever the reason, the new system has worked, with Niemi and Lehtonen splitting time and the Stars set to make a major jump this season.\n\nSteven Stamkos and Anze Kopitar are heading toward big decisions in 2016. Getty Images\n\nKopitar and Stamkos play the waiting game: Long shadows are cast over two of the NHL's top teams. Franchise cornerstones Anze Kopitar of the Los Angeles Kings and Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning are shaking things up as they negotiate early extensions.\n\nThe longer it goes before Kopitar and Stamkos sign, the more rampant the speculation and rumors regarding their contract status have grown. It's a different approach, especially considering how almost all of the highest-paid players signed their current monster contracts long before becoming unrestricted free agents.\n\nHow negotiations ultimately play out for Kopitar and Stamkos could set the standard for similar franchise players and free agency. Not to mention drastically alter the fortunes of several teams, particularly the Lightning.\n\nThe 2016 World Cup of Hockey will be played in Toronto in September. Graig Abel/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nWorld Cup details are revealed: The new overtime format was the major tweak entering the season, but the upcoming World Cup of Hockey is undoubtedly the league's major play. As with 3-on-3 overtime, the response has been mixed. But with outdoor stadium games reaching critical mass, the NHL -- in conjunction with the NHLPA, in this case -- wanted to introduce a property that, unlike the Olympics, it could market and manage on its own.\n\nIt isn't a conventional tournament format. Not with one team made up of miscellaneous Europeans and another consisting of North Americans aged 24 and under. But if the World Cup is a success, then the NHL could have a new marquee event it can lean on for attention (and revenue) in non-Olympic years.\n\nAndong Song was the first Chinese-born player to be selected in the NHL draft. Stanley Chou/Getty Images\n\nHockey grows in Asia: History was made when New York Islanders sixth-round pick Andong Song became the first Chinese player taken in the NHL draft. The selection made waves in Asia, but the game's place on the continent didn't end there.\n\nThe tipping point might have come when Beijing National Stadium (that giant birds' nest seen during the 2008 Summer Olympics) hosted the inaugural Canada-China Sports Business Summit in November. The conference brought Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Inc., the corporate giant that owns the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors, together with more than 150 Chinese corporate and government officials.\n\nThis could lead to a hockey boom in a massive untapped area that will host the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeong Chang, South Korea, and 2022 Games in Beijing. With the Chinese government committed to getting 300 million new participants involved in winter sports by 2022, 2015 could be the year hockey started taking over Asia.", "NHL -- Eddie Olczyk and his familiy are living and loving the hockey life": "CHICAGO -- Diana Olczyk can still remember the color of the pamphlet her oldest son, Eddie Olczyk, handed her more than 40 years ago, the one that started it all.\n\nThe yellow pamphlet was an invitation to learn how to skate at Ballard Sports Complex in Niles, Illinois. The Olczyks had been more of a football and baseball family to that point, but 6-year-old Eddie wanted to give skating a try.\n\nEddie skated, and a hockey family was born. Eddie went on to become one of the United States' top players. He played 16 seasons in the NHL, coached in the NHL and is now one of the game's most recognizable television commentators.\n\nEddie was just the start, though.\n\nHis younger brother, Ricky Olczyk, also fell in love with the game. Ricky didn't possess the talent Eddie did, though, and his playing days ended in college. That didn't stop him from continuing to pursue a hockey career, and Ricky made his own way to the NHL through the front office. He is currently assistant general manager for the Carolina Hurricanes. A third brother, Randy, 44, works at Chicagoland Commercial, an area real estate company.\n\nThe hockey tradition has also carried on with Eddie's three sons, who are all coaching and playing hockey.\n\n\"Once you're in, you're in,\" said Eddie, 49, who is an analyst for the Chicago Blackhawks and nationally for NBC. \"I knew what I wanted to do when I was 12 years old. I had one goal. I was lucky enough that I had the support of my folks and I had a gift. I believe it was a God-given gift to play hockey. It's been pretty amazing that the boys and my brother are still in the game.\"\n\nThe success the Olczyk family has had in the sport can largely be credited to the sacrifices Diana and her husband, Ed, made early in Eddie's career. Once Eddie showed promise in hockey, he began to have more opportunities to play against better competition, which meant having to send him around the United States and into Canada. For a working-class family, that wasn't always easy.\n\nThese days Ed Olczyk, seen here with NBC colleague Mike Emrick, is known more for his TV work. Andre Ringuette/NHLI/Getty Images\n\n\"We didn't know how expensive traveling was,\" Diana said. \"We were simple people. My husband worked a lot of hours. I worked with the kids and stuff. We went to the bank and borrowed $675 and signed a promissory note so he could go on a hockey trip. That kind of reminds you, 'Work hard and you do what you have to do and it's for your children.' To us, family is everything.\"\n\nThe family shared Eddie's hockey journey, turning out-of-state hockey tournaments into vacations. Everyone's schedule had to be in sync to get to practices on time. That became more complicated when the family moved from Niles, a northwest Chicago suburb, to Palos Heights, a southwest suburb, and Eddie still had practices in the northwest suburbs.\n\n\"I remember times when my mom would drive me in the car with my gear,\" Eddie said. \"We'd park at the tollway oasis, walk together, meet halfway. My mom would take my dad's car to go home to go south. We'd go north for hockey. That's what we did.\"\n\nRicky looked up to his older brother throughout Eddie's hockey ascension and began dedicating himself to the sport as well. Unlike Eddie, who was a forward, Ricky's path was as a defenseman. He was named a captain at Brown University during his senior season.\n\nRicky had a few small professional hockey opportunities out of college, but decided against them. He earned a law degree at Cornell, worked for the NHL Players' Association for two years, and spent time in Phoenix and Chicago at consulting and law firms. He was hired by the Edmonton Oilers in 2007 as director of hockey administration and legal affairs, and eventually was promoted to assistant general manager. He joined the Hurricanes as assistant general manager in June 2014.\n\n\"Hockey has always been a part of my fabric in every academic endeavor I've done,\" said Ricky, 45, who was recently named to the management staff for Team Europe's entry in the World Cup of Hockey. \"I've always tied it somehow. I always wanted to have my job combine my two loves -- hockey and law -- eventually. Happy to say I've done that today.\"\n\nHurricanes general manager Ron Francis has known the Olczyk family for years. He was teammates with Eddie and now works with Ricky, and Francis wasn't surprised the brothers each reached the NHL.\n\n\"I guess I'm not, knowing the family and their background,\" Francis said. \"The mom and dad are extremely honest, hardworking, genuine people. The boys have a lot of those traits. They're just good people and hardworking. If they put something to mind, there's a good chance they'll succeed at it.\"\n\nWith Eddie and Ricky being four years apart and Eddie leaving home when he was 16 to play hockey, they spent only a part of their childhoods together. Their relationship has changed as adults.\n\n\"I think we've gotten closer,\" Ricky said. \"Again, his love for hockey and his passion, and my love and passion for hockey is a common bond. We're able to talk about anything and everything. I'm very fortunate to have that relationship with him. We both do it with [other brother] Randy as well.\"\n\nTheir parents have enjoyed watching the relationship evolve and witnessing how each son arrived at his goal of the NHL in his own way.\n\n\"They love what they're doing,\" Ed said of his sons. \"I kid them every so often, 'You guys never had a real job.' Saying that tongue-in-cheek as I'm eating my heart out. I played football, and I was eliminated as the pyramid got higher and narrower. It was a thrill for me to see both sons be so good and successful. I'm proud as heck. I'm just proud as heck.\"\n\nTommy Olczyk, seen here in 2014, is entering his senior season with the Nittany Lions. Dave Reginek/Getty Images\n\nEddie's sons are continuing the hockey tradition in the Olczyk family. His oldest son, also named Eddie, is a 26-year-old assistant coach at Niagara University. Tommy, 25, is a senior forward for nationally ranked Penn State. Eddie's youngest son, Nick, 19, plays for the South Shore Kings of the U.S. Premier Hockey League and will play at Colorado College beginning next season. Daughter Zandra, 20, is attending University of Alabama.\n\n\"Our lives are hockey,\" Nick said. \"We have a plaque, actually, in our house right when you walk in the foyer that says, 'We interrupt this family for hockey.' I think that's a perfect slogan if you can quote our family.\"\n\nAnd it all began with that little yellow pamphlet.\n\n\"It's neat,\" Ricky said. \"We're very, very blessed. I don't know why we're so deserving of these fortunes. We're truly grateful and appreciative of it.

Today, we look at the top on-court moments of 2015, but click here to check out the rest of our list.\n\nTop on-court storylines of the year\n\n1. Dual dominance from Novak and Serena\n\nIt was big when they won, and bigger when they didn't. With six Slams, 16 titles and firm holds on No. 1, this season was defined by what Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams achieved -- and the few things they couldn't. Djokovic ended the season by winning his fourth straight ATP World Tour Title and nearly doubled No. 2 Andy Murray in rankings points.\n\n2. Big Four and one more\n\nStan Wawrinka's run at the French Open not only halted Djokovic from winning everything, but the win gave the Swiss two Slams in two years and prompted talk of a big five in men's tennis. And as for the other four, they actually increased their collective dominance from a year ago.\n\nMurray had his best clay season and won Davis Cup, Roger Federer was the most regular challenger to Djokovic, and even Rafael Nadal looked back on track by the ATP Tour Finals. There may or may not be a big five, but there's a big gap between them and the others.\n\n3. Italians shake up US Open\n\nIt was supposed to be about William's quest for the Grand Slam, but two Italians tore up the script and took the tournament for themselves. Roberta Vinci stunned Williams in the semifinals to set up a final against childhood friend Flavia Pennetta, who then proceeded to win her first Grand Slam. Watching from the box was Pennetta's fianc\u00e9, Fabio Fognini, who had already sent Nadal packing in one of the biggest matches of the men's event.\n\n4. Nadal's clay empire falls\n\nEditor's Picks 2015 on-court controversies of the year: Kyrgios makes it personal There's trash-talking, and then there is trash-talking. Nick Kyrgios' crude remarks to Stan Wawrinka earlier this year went too far.\n\n2015 tantrums of the year: Coco goes bonkers It's easy to lose your cool on the tennis court, but Coco Vandeweghe took her frustration to a new level. Just watch.\n\nTop points of the year: Here's how you beat Djokovic It takes a lot to beat Novak Djokovic. But Benoit Paire dug deep into his bag of tricks against the world No. 1 in our top point of the season. 2 Related\n\nSince his first French Open victory in 2005, Nadal had been almost untouchable on red clay, winning nine French Open titles and more than 40 tournaments in total on the surface. But not this year. The Spaniard won only two smaller clay titles, fell to Djokovic in the French Open quarterfinals and went 26-6 on clay. The question now is whether Nadal can reconquer his territory.\n\n5. Young guns slow in arriving\n\nAny changing of the guard in the men's game was put on hold as the top up-and-comers took steps backwards. Kei Nishikori fell from No. 5 to No. 7, Milos Raonic from No. 8 to No. 14, 2014 US Open champ Marin Cilic from No. 9 to No.13 and Grigor Dimitrov from No. 11 to No. 28.\n\nNow between 24 and 27 years old, they're also wearing the young gun label a little thin.\n\nIf there was any movement outside the upper-echelon players, it came from the newbies. Nine teenagers won Challenger titles this season. So far, four of them have reached the top 100.\n\nYounger players did slightly better on the WTA tour, with 24-year-old Simona Halep catapulting to No. 2 and Garbine Muguruza, 22, making the most significant stride of the season by reaching the Wimbledon final and reaching No. 3 in the world. Others like Karolina Pliskova, 23, Madison Keys, 20, Elina Svitolina, 21, and Belinda Bencic, 19, finished in the top 20.\n\n6. Older players thriving\n\nMeanwhile, the tour veterans have been making a fine showing. Williams is No. 1 at 34, the oldest ever to hold the top spot, while sister Venus, 35, is back in the top 10. Federer, the same age as Williams, is No. 3, and is joined in the top 10 by 33-year-old David Ferrer. The average age of the ATP top 10 is now 30 years old.\n\nWhat's more, some players are even reaching career highs in their 30s -- once seen as retirement age for most tennis professionals. Among them are Feliciano Lopez, Gilles Muller, Julien Benneteau, Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, and Victor Estrella Burgos, with a whole lot looking set to follow suit.\n\nAs for the six women who reached the top 10 for the first time this season, four -- Ekaterina Makarova, Carla Suarez Navarro, Lucie Safarova and Timea Bacsinszky -- were 26 or older.\n\n7. No. 1 and anyone\n\nThe WTA pecking order behind Williams became even more blurry following a merry-go-around of a season. Halep played well on hard courts, but didn't fare as well on her favored clay. Maria Sharapova started quickly, but injuries derailed her season.\n\nMuguruza played well down the stretch, reaching the semifinals of the WTA Finals but showed inconsistency during the season. Inconsistency was also the overarching theme for Petra Kvitova and Agnieszka Radwanska.\n\nAnd former No. 1s Caroline Wozniacki, Ana Ivanovic and Victoria Azarenka were pretty much non-factors. With little hierarchy, it's anyone's game.\n\n8. Hingis turns doubles queen\n\nWith partner Sania Mirza, Martina Hingis, 35, won Wimbledon and the US Open in 2015. Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images\n\nShe won Grand Slams in her teens before twice coming back from retirement, and now Martina Hingis is once again at the top of the game -- in doubles. The 35-year-old from Switzerland had been slowly making her way up in a doubles-only comeback, but took off once she partnered with Sania Mirza toward the beginning of the season.\n\nHingis won 10 doubles titles, nine with Mirza, including Wimbledon and the US Open. Hingis also teamed with Leander Paes to win the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open in mixed doubles.\n\n9. Bryans slip down ranks\n\nHaving set just almost every significant team record in doubles, Bob and Mike Bryan slipped from their perch this season, finishing ranked Nos. 4 and 3, respectively. The twins won just six titles, their lowest since 2005 and did not win a Slam for the first time since 2004. Between injuries and growing families, they couldn't get a roll going.\n\n10. American youngsters make waves\n\nThe conversation around the American men's game began to change this season with several talented youngsters showing their potential. The top-ranked American is 30-year-old John Isner at No. 11, with the next top prospect looking like 23-year-old Jack Sock. But there's a wave building in the junior ranks.\n\nThree straight junior Slams were won by teenaged Americans -- Tommy Paul at the French Open, Reilly Opelka at Wimbledon and Taylor Fritz at the US Open -- joining Noah Rubin at Wimbledon a year ago. Three teenage Americans have climbed into the top 200 -- Jared Donaldson, Fritz and Frances Tiafoe. At one point this season, three of the top four junior boys were Americans.\n\nThe Slam drought is still on, as is the lack of American men in the top 10, but the turnaround might have begun.", "NHL -- Auston Matthews is the best player in the world not in the NHL": "Craig Custance speaks with top prospect Auston Matthews about his experiences playing in Switzerland this year and being more comfortable in his second year playing in the World Juniors. (2:43)\n\nThe support came in the form of calls and texts. A call from Keith Tkachuk. Another one from Shane Doan, extra special for a kid who started playing hockey in the Coyotes practice facility at 6 years old.\n\nPatrick Kane reached out. So did countless others.\n\nA 16-year-old Auston Matthews had just broken his leg. He was hundreds of miles from the Arizona home where he grew up, away from home the first time in his life to pursue his hockey dream -- a pursuit that would eventually take him much, much farther away.\n\nHe was at the hospital recovering from the break to his left femur that happened in just his second career game with the U.S. National Development Team Program.\n\nThere was a moment in this hospital room when Auston's father, Brian, could sense his son needed time alone. He needed some space. So, Brian went downstairs and grabbed a bite to eat.\n\nWhen he returned to the hospital room, the frustration from a bad break -- suffered during a knee-on-knee hit -- had been replaced by determination. His son, with his left leg immobilized by pins, was already up on crutches.\n\nHe saw a fire in Auston's eyes that hadn't been there previously.\n\n\"A lot of kids take for granted they're just bulletproof,\" Brian Matthews said. \"It's not until something like that happens, you respect the blessings of life.\"\n\nCoupled with the support coming from a hometown star like Doan and other American hockey royalty, this was the moment Brian looks back at and can say he started to realize something special was happening with his son.\n\nTkachuk, we now know, orchestrated some of the calls of support. His son Matthew played with Auston, and Tkachuk knew the devastation that can come with a serious injury early in the development cycle.\n\nThe hockey community jumped to action. Longtime Coyotes equipment manager Stan Wilson quickly relayed a message from Tkachuk to Doan to make a call. Tkachuk reached out to others and the messages started coming.\n\n\"Phone calls, texts -- the list was enormous,\" Brian said.\n\nSaid Tkachuk: \"I just wanted to let him know it wasn't the end of the world.\"\n\nAs it turns out, it wasn't even close. At best, a small footnote.\n\nAuston Matthews and Team USA are looking for gold at the world juniors after a disappointing finish last year. Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images\n\n\"He came back quicker than anybody I've seen come back from that,\" Tkachuk said. \"It was remarkable.\"\n\nSince then, Auston Matthews' star has risen and now begins the moment where the once-occasional spotlight becomes permanent on hockey's next big star.\n\nTo put into perspective just how good this kid from Arizona is, had he been born a few days earlier he would have been eligible for the 2015 draft. The conversation there would have been less about Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel, and more about McDavid and Matthews vying to become the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nIt's no knock on Eichel, a great player in his own right. It's just that Matthews projects to be even better. One Eastern Conference talent evaluator didn't hesitate when asked this week if Matthews would have gone No. 2 in the 2015 draft behind McDavid.\n\n\"I would have taken him ahead of Eichel, for sure,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday against Team Canada, Matthews and Team USA begin their quest for their first gold medal in the World Junior Championship since 2013. Last year, an American group with a 17-year-old Matthews, Eichel and Dylan Larkin fell disappointingly short in Montreal, and that chagrin is still fresh in the minds of the Americans.\n\nIt's also the tournament that will reinforce what everybody in Switzerland, where Matthews is playing professional hockey this season, already knows:\n\nHe is the best player in the world not playing in the NHL.\n\nAn instant attraction\n\nMatthews is sitting in a conference room of a Boston boutique hotel, carrying himself with the maturity of someone years older. The only hint he's just 18 years old is that an interview is delaying a trip to the mall across the street.\n\nBut he's patient and when asked to start at the beginning, to tell about how a kid born in the desert started playing hockey, there's no hint of annoyance or frustration to retell a story he's probably already told a million times.\n\n\"I fell in love with hockey right when I started playing,\" Matthews began.\n\nMatthews is Exhibit A of the importance to the growth of the game in the United States for the NHL to have a place in non-traditional markets. His love of hockey started in a house league at the Coyotes practice rink, the Ice Den, when he was 6.\n\nHis dad grew up playing basketball and baseball but enjoyed watching Kings games while living in Los Angeles. His mom, Ema, couldn't have been more removed from the sport. Born in Mexico, one of eight siblings, her knowledge of the sport was about as limited as can be.\n\n\"The only thing I knew about hockey is that it was a sport,\" she said with a laugh. \"That's all.\"\n\nAnd when Brian watched Kings games on TV, she wasn't impressed.\n\n\"I thought it was crazy, some guys just playing with the puck,\" she said. \"To me it was not that great. I got into it when Auston got into it.\" And Matthews most certainly got into it.\n\nHe might have been a more gifted baseball player, but hockey was his love and he grew up in an Arizona hockey scene that is better than people realize. His youth teams didn't always beat those from Michigan, New York or Minnesota, but they won their share.\n\nAlong the way, the Matthews family officially became a hockey family.\n\n\"I don't watch anything else,\" Ema said. \"It's amazing how hockey is bringing us to love this game.\"\n\nIt would also take Ema to yet another new country.\n\nPlaying in Switzerland this season has allowed Auston Matthews to develop his game in a way he might not have in college. Sparta Prague/Champions Hockey League/Getty Images\n\nChanges of scenery\n\nOne of the byproducts of being raised in Arizona is that Matthews didn't grow up a die-hard fan of any major U.S. colleges. He wasn't a Boston kid deciding between Boston College and Boston University, or a Detroit kid pulled between the University of Michigan and Michigan State when the time came to make a college choice after breaking Patrick Kane's scoring records at the U.S. National Team Development Program.\n\nNor did he feel any allegiance to the Everett Silvertips, the WHL team that drafted him.\n\nAs fate would have it, the 2015 U-18 World Championships were held in Zug, Switzerland, sparking the idea of Matthews taking a non-traditional route in his draft year.\n\n\"My agent, Judd [Moldaver], kind of brought it up. We were talking on the phone and he brought it up and said, 'What if you played in Europe for a year, played in a good league in Sweden or Switzerland?' We didn't have anything made up, we were just thinking of ideas,\" Matthews said. \"I said, 'Yeah, you know, maybe, we'll see.'\"\n\nThe seed was planted.\n\nConversations continued at CAA between Matthews' representatives Moldaver and Pat Brisson, as well as at home between Matthews and his family.\n\n\"This was a thoughtful, detailed process that had many conversations and discussions to make sure it was in Auston's best interests,\" Moldaver said. \"The credit goes to him and his family. They were strong through this process.\"\n\nThe idea was to have Matthews play one season with Zurich in the Swiss league, in part because of the presence of former NHL coach Marc Crawford, now in his fourth season in Zurich.\n\nAlready in Switzerland to watch Matthews play in the World Championships, the Matthews family met with the management in Zurich and both sides left impressed.\n\n\"We showed them the city, the facility, went to our president and everything,\" said Zurich GM Edgar Salis. \"It was a new situation. He is, by far, the youngest import ever in that league.\"\n\nBrian was convinced.\n\n\"The Lions, from top to bottom, it was just a class organization from Day 1,\" he said. \"It had to be this team. There was no other option.\"\n\nIt's worked so well that Matthews has been presented as a trailblazer, creating a route for other high-end hockey prospects to take to the top of the draft, even if that was never the intention.\n\nEven Sidney Crosby, the biggest name in the game, has noticed the success. He wonders what it might mean for other high-end prospects moving forward.\n\n\"When you're that good, there's so many options,\" Crosby said. \"As long as you're playing the way you want to play, getting the opportunity you want to get, I don't think it matters where you play. The fact that he gets to play against men is a bonus.\"\n\nAs is the fact that he's been able to develop his game at such a high level without the intense scrutiny that followed Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel so closely last season.\n\nThat changes this week.\n\nThe Team USA brass is impressed with Auston Matthews' game, and he's earning comparisons to the best players in the NHL. Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images\n\nLet the hype begin\n\nWatching the World Junior Championship tournament is a Canadian holiday tradition that has seeped south to hockey fans in the United States. At the American training camp in Boston last week, Team USA players talked about watching the WJC games while growing up, perhaps the first generation of American players to do so with the tournament now regularly shown in the States on NHL Network.\n\nIt also marks the beginning of the real hype that surrounds the top players in the draft. Matthews' game will be scrutinized closely by fans and scouts in the coming weeks, scrutiny that will intensify as the Draft Combine gets closer and then peak at the draft.\n\nThose watching him closely have found very little to dislike. In his first 22 games with Zurich, he has 14 goals and 25 points, pretty ridiculous production for a teenager playing against men. Matthews has made it look remarkably easy.\n\n\"He's jumped in right away. I thought that by the end of the year he would be a top guy and he was good right away,\" said Crawford. \"He's arguably the best player in the league. From a pure dynamic standpoint, he is the best player.\"\n\nTeam USA coach Ron Wilson found a complete player in Matthews when he made the trip from Switzerland to Boston for Team USA training camp last week.\n\n\"There's really no weaknesses in his game,\" Wilson said. \"I can't remember anybody quite like this; this is going to be really exciting to see.\"\n\nUnder Crawford, Matthews has rounded out his game on both sides of his ice with a focus on positioning and playing without the puck.\n\nIt's the kind of professional development he might not have received playing major junior hockey in Canada or even college hockey.\n\n\"A lot of times, he was so good, he could pick pucks away from people because he had a long reach and good sense of anticipation,\" Crawford said. \"As you keep going up the next level, people protect the puck better. They can spin off you better, now it becomes important that you play the game with an offensive edge but do it educated. Stay on the right side when you try to pick the puck, so if you miss it, they have to come through you. It's awareness when you don't have the puck.\"\n\nCrawford also isn't sheltering Matthews.\n\nIf he plays him against poor competition, it's simply because he's trying to expose a matchup during the course of the game in order to win. And he's not afraid to share his displeasure when his young prodigy messes up.\n\nMatthews remembered a goal being scored on the Lions after he lost his guy at center.\n\n\"I was shaking my head and I looked up and I saw [Crawford] staring at me,\" Matthews said. \"He pointed me over and said, 'Don't you ever make that mistake again.' He said some other stuff, too. It was my fault. It's a learning process. I think I've come a long way since the beginning of the year.\"\n\nThat progress is confirmed by NHL scouts and executives, who have heard the comparisons between Matthews and Jonathan Toews or Anze Kopitar, and believe they're completely warranted.\n\n\"It's a fair comparison in terms of projection and upside,\" said a Western Conference executive. \"He does have an even higher-end skill than those guys, but you're still waiting to see how the body develops and how he can deal with the grind of an NHL season. What makes Toews and Kopitar so good is they are doing it against top competition night in and night out. That's the question you have with Matthews.\"\n\nAt this point, it might be the only question. Besides, of course, where he will end up playing next season.\n\nHe's going to be the No. 1 overall pick in June and nine teams are within three points of the bottom spot in the standings. One of those teams just happens to be the Arizona Coyotes. The hometown team. The reason he's playing hockey.\n\nMatthew's dad is quick to say the family will support any team that selects Matthews. But c'mon, his mom is from Mexico. He even speaks a little Spanish. He was raised in Arizona. The promotion possibilities in Phoenix would be endless.\n\nIt would be perfect.\n\nMatthews gives a little laugh of acknowledgement.\n\n\"We'll see what happens,\" he said.", "Jason Dufner-Brandt Snedeker team wins Franklin Templeton Shootout": "NAPLES, Fla. -- Jason Dufner felt his pairing with Brandt Snedeker would work out well, particularly in best ball.\n\nHe was right.\n\nDufner and Snedeker birdied the last two holes in best ball on Saturday and won the Franklin Templeton Shootout by two shots. The Dufner-Snedeker team finished at 30-under 186 at Tiburon Golf Club.\n\nJason Dufner and Brandt Snedeker birdied the last two holes to win the Franklin Templeton Shootout by two shots over Harris English and Matt Kuchar. Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\n\"I'm pretty consistent, I'm in the fairway, I'm on the greens. That gives him a lot of confidence,\" Dufner said. \"He putts really well so that gives me more confidence. I was able to stroke the ball a lot freer this week.\"\n\nAdded Snedeker: \"I play with Jason a lot and this is the best I've ever seen him roll it.\"\n\nHarris English and Matt Kuchar, who have finished first, second and second the past three years, shot 28 under for second. Charley Hoffman and PGA Rookie of the Year Daniel Berger finished at 27 under.\n\nHoffman and Berger, who led by a shot after Friday's round, struggled early, particularly Hoffman.\n\nDufner-Snedeker, starting one shot back, had six birdies on the front nine. A Snedeker chip-in from 30 feet on No. 3 helped get them off to a good start.\n\n\"I thought today we did exactly what I thought we had to do,\" Snedeker said.\n\nThey followed with birdies on Nos. 10, 12, 13, 17 and 18 as they kept attacking.\n\n\"The key for us was 17,\" Snedeker said. \"(Jason) made a clutch, tough 4-footer down the hill that gave us the lead going into the last home.\n\nEnglish-Kuchar missed some of the putts they made on their way to the 2013 title. One of the putts that left Kuchar particularly frustrated was a 4-footer he sent long on No. 15.\n\n\"On 15, it was left to right, which is not easy and the wind was going with the break,\" Kuchar said. \"Usually, that's one I make most of the time. It's a bummer to miss it.\n\n\"We had good putts and it was a good week but to win, you certainly have to make ones inside 10 feet and then make a couple of others.\"", "St. Louis formally submits stadium proposal": "ST. LOUIS -- One day before the NFL's deadline to accept stadium proposals from the three home markets vying to keep their teams, St. Louis submitted the most comprehensive and actionable plan of the three.\n\nMissouri Gov. Jay Nixon's stadium task force submitted a formal proposal for the estimated $1.1 billion venue on the city's north riverfront Tuesday morning.\n\nThe proposal was addressed to the six owners on the NFL's Los Angeles Opportunities Committee, and copies were also sent to commissioner Roger Goodell, Rams owner Stan Kroenke and team executives, and the rest of the NFL owners. Task force leaders Dave Peacock and Bob Blitz have been working on the project for more than a year and, after many tweaks, finalized and forwarded the roughly 400-page proposal.\n\n\"St. Louis has formally presented a $1.1 billion project that delivers more than $400 million in public financing and support, as well as a plan for an ultra-modern stadium on our downtown riverfront that the NFL and the St. Louis Rams will be extremely proud to call their own,\" Peacock said. \"Our proposal is the result of extraordinary teamwork by multiple government agencies, business leaders and industry experts, and is the culmination of intense work over the past 13 months to deliver on the certainty that has understandably been requested by the NFL.\"\n\nThe plan calls for $400 million in public money via city and state funds as well as tax credits, $250 million from NFL team ownership and $300 million from the NFL G4 loan program. The additional money is expected to come from the sale of personal seat licenses.\n\nUnder the proposal, the St. Louis Regional Convention and Sports Complex Authority would own the stadium and land, with the Rams paying annual rent of $1.5 million plus a 3 percent annual boost over the life of the proposed 30-year lease. All stadium revenues, including the naming rights, would go to the team.\n\nAmong potential sticking points, the $300 million from the G4 program would be unprecedented for a one-team stadium. The G4 traditionally offers up to $200 million, though the New York Jets and New York Giants received additional funds for MetLife Stadium. Goodell sent a letter to the task force a couple of weeks ago making it clear that there's no guarantee that an extra $100 million would be available.\n\nThe NFL has planned another round of owners meetings for Jan. 12-13 in Houston in hopes of making some decisions on whether Kroenke will get to move to Los Angeles and build his stadium in Inglewood, California, or the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders will get to move and build in Carson.\n\nSan Diego and Oakland have until Wednesday to offer proposals, and though it's believed all three will submit something, only St. Louis has a plan that includes actionable public money at this point.

Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers were favorites early. Cam Newton supplanted them late, with Russell Wilson giving chase down the stretch.

Heck, even Conor McGregor said he wished the fight against Jose Aldo would have gone longer. Such is the nature of the fight game though, and there's no arguing Dec. 12 was a monumental evening in mixed martial arts.\n\nMcGregor's knockout is one of literally dozens of performances worth talking about coming out of the UFC's three-events-in-three-days marathon. Let's take a look back at some of the key individual performances.\n\nFrankie Edgar\n\nTUF 22 Finale (featherweights)\n\nDefeated Chad Mendes (KO1/2:28)\n\nIf you don't love Edgar by now, you're doing it wrong. All this guy does is focus on himself, prepare better than anyone in the sport and turn in one professional performance after another. Even in defeat, I've never seen Edgar have an off night. And that alone makes him an interesting candidate to fight McGregor. Look, when you knock out the most dominant champion in your division's history in 13 seconds, you have the right to move up in weight. McGregor can bolt for lightweight if he wants. But there is one last \"question\" for him to answer at 145. And it's \"The Answer,\" Frankie Edgar.\n\nConor McGregor\n\nUFC 194 (featherweight championship)\n\nDefeated Jose Aldo (KO1/0:13)\n\nMany expected McGregor to fight Aldo in 2015. None of us expected him to open as a betting favorite and then finish the all-time great in 13 seconds. If you want to view this outcome as slightly fluky, I mean, I understand the temptation. If these two fought 100 times, I don't think many would end within the first exchange. I choose to view this outcome, however, as irrefutable proof of McGregor's elite abilities. He seemed to know what Aldo was going to do before Aldo did. He threw the perfect shot. That one moment symbolizes everything from his athletic gifts, technical skill, calm nerves, vision, confidence, etc. It was a perfect performance by McGregor.\n\nRose Namajunas\n\nUFC Fight Night (strawweights)\n\nDefeated Paige VanZant (Sub5/2:25)\n\nGet on this wave now. This is going to be a fun ride. It already has been. Namajunas seems older than 23, maybe because she already fought for a UFC title, but she's really just getting started. She proved her finishing capability a long time ago, but this five-round execution showcased her entire arsenal in ways we hadn't seen previously. Part of that was because of what proved to be an overmatched opponent in VanZant, but at least you can say VanZant never quit and gave Namajunas 22 minutes of opportunity to break her, from a mental and cardiovascular standpoint. Namajunas was cool, calm, collected and crew-cutted. She's going to be fun to watch.\n\nLuke Rockhold\n\nUFC 194 (middleweight championship)\n\nDefeated Chris Weidman (TKO4/3:12)\n\nThis fight was what we thought it would be -- the sport at its absolute finest. Set aside the finish, Rockhold still won every round. It was about as dominant a performance as one could have expected in a fight this evenly matched. The complexion of Weidman's face changed after literally the first resounding body kick Rockhold landed. Just like another popular, big southpaw on the card (\"Mystic Mac,\" they call him), it's a different ballgame when Rockhold hits you.There was poetic justice in him blocking that spinning wheel kick (the shot Vitor Belfort knocked him out with) in the third round, which led to the full mount that essentially ended the fight.\n\nEditor's Picks McGregor's next move?

Stats & Info looks into the historic numbers. 1 Related\n\nMichael Chiesa\n\nUFC Fight Night (lightweight)\n\nDefeated Jim Miller (Sub2/2:57)\n\nMiller is no longer in his 2011, seven-fight winning streak form, but submitting Mr. Miller is nevertheless an impressive feat. With 34 fights going off in three days, \"be memorable\" should have been on the to-do list of every athlete competing. Chiesa came to Las Vegas to make a point and I believe it got across. Take out a highly respected veteran and beat him at his own game. Check. Clearly state exactly where you feel you belong in the division. Check. In no uncertain terms, demand what you expect next. Check. Chiesa vs. Beneil Dariush looks like a good matchup to me.\n\nSage Northcutt\n\nUFC Fight Night (lightweights)\n\nDefeated Cody Pfister (Sub2/0:41)\n\nThere was a highly questionable stand-up in the first round of this fight, which, of course, was highly paid attention to as it feels like the world (and the UFC) wants to see this 19-year-old succeed. Pfister got a raw deal on that stand-up but ultimately, and you can't ever say for sure but I feel confident here, it didn't alter the outcome. Maybe Pfister would have spent the entire first round in top position but he wasn't getting much done from there and Northcutt, man, you've got to give the kid credit, he seems completely unfazed by the expectations and spotlight he's under. It's impossible to miss his athleticism in everything he does. Even when he was struggling to work out of the bottom, that raw athleticism nearly got the job done on multiple occasions. You can say the UFC is promoting Northcutt because of his cut physique and frosted tips, but there is no denying the very real potential here. Two fights into his UFC career, I'm impressed.\n\nAljamain Sterling\n\nUFC Fight Night (bantamweights)\n\nDefeated Johnny Eduardo (Sub2/4:18)\n\nAlready ESPN.com's No. 9 ranked bantamweight coming into the fight, Sterling had a relatively easy go against a very, very underrated opponent in Eduardo. It will be very interesting to see what happens when Sterling meets a versatile, skilled opponent he can't easily take down. Sterling is well rounded, but until someone truly shuts down his A game -- offensive wrestling and heavy top game -- we'll have to wonder how truly elite he is. Thus far, he has passed every test in his young career and he's confident in his skills (he wouldn't have fought out his UFC contract if he wasn't). He deserves a pay increase and a top-five opponent. I'm guessing he'll get both.\n\nUrijah Faber\n\nUFC 194 (bantamweights)\n\nDefeated Frankie Saenz (UD)\n\nFaber won and it was never really in doubt, but I'll admit: This was the first time I've seen glimpses of Father Time catching up to \"The California Kid\" at 36. Maybe there was an adrenaline dump after a near-finish in the second round. Maybe his rehydration didn't go as well, with the UFC banning IVs. Maybe there was an undisclosed injury. Whatever the reason, Faber looked a tick slower. His recovery from shots took a second longer. He's still Urijah Faber and his wealth of knowledge in the Octagon shows. And, as always, he appeared to be in phenomenal shape. But this was his 41st professional fight. There are signs it's catching up. Enjoy him while you can.\n\nTony Ferguson\n\nTUF 22 Finale (lightweights)\n\nDefeated Edson Barboza (Sub2/2:54)\n\nFerguson was a little nuts in this fight, but to be fair, Ferguson is a little nuts, period. Ferguson walked into some awful-looking shots against Barboza and barely seemed to notice. Prior to the fight, he called out McGregor, whom he shares management with, and there's actually a comparison to be made between Ferguson and McGregor in the cage. Ferguson is huge, unorthodox and his mental tenacity to break opponents is overwhelming. I've said it before and I'll say it again (and I want this on record): Ferguson will fight for the UFC title in 2016 and, win or lose, he'll make it competitive. Against anyone.\n\nChris Weidman\n\nUFC 194 (middleweight championship)\n\nLost to Luke Rockhold (TKO4/3:12)\n\nThere's a good chance Weidman thinks about that unsuccessful spinning wheel kick in the third round for the rest of his life. In reality, you can't say that single mistake cost him the fight -- but it sure didn't help. This was a grueling fight with a lot of body work by both middleweights and Weidman appeared to get the worst of it. As Rockhold predicted before the fight, Weidman eventually turned pretty strongly to his wrestling and for the first time in his career, it wasn't there. This is the guy who dethroned Anderson Silva and, before Saturday, wanted a piece of Jon Jones. Hopefully that confidence isn't shaken too much by this. The middleweight division still needs Chris Weidman.\n\nRonaldo \"Jacare\" Souza\n\nUFC 194 (middleweights)\n\nLost to Yoel Romero (SD)\n\nFull disclosure: I thought Souza won the fight. He was basically out on his feet as he retreated to his corner after the first round, but I thought he recovered well and went on to win the rest of the fight. He even put a stamp on it by nearly knocking out Romero in the third. Romero took away Souza's best weapon (his top game) with his terrific defensive wrestling, and I still thought Jacare won the fight (even though the judges disagreed). There was a time I thought Souza was a dark horse to win a UFC championship, but it's hard seeing him match up well at this point with the Rockholds and Weidmans of the division. I feel for him though. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says he deserves a championship shot.\n\nPaige VanZant\n\nUFC Fight Night (strawweights)\n\nLost to Rose Namajunas (Sub5/2:25)\n\nHer postfight assessment was spot on. At 21 years old, still relatively new to MMA, her technique doesn't yet match her athletic gifts and heart. Just imagine how good VanZant will be, however, if it ever does. Of course, when everyone is talking about how tough you are, it means you're getting worked over. But at this stage of her career, this loss proved more about VanZant's potential than it did her limitations. She has a lot to learn. A lot. There's something very cliche about suggesting this loss will ultimately be good for her, but that could very well be the case.\n\nYoel Romero\n\nUFC 194 (middleweights)\n\nDefeated Ronaldo Souza (SD)\n\nI thought Romero lost. He looked like a man who wanted to conserve energy, but still gassed late. The spinning backfist knockdown was phenomenal and he was very good attacking Souza's dangerous guard. Did he not take the second round off, though? I just don't see how he won that round. The fence grabs and the excessive water thrown on him between rounds -- personally, I'm not going after Romero for that. Until officials truly punish him, why not bend the rules? Romero's talents are completely off the charts, even in line with Rockhold, but this performance didn't scream \"future champ\" to me. As I said, it actually looked like a loss.\n\nChad Mendes\n\nTUF 22 Finale (featherweights)\n\nLost to Frankie Edgar (KO1/2:28)\n\nA five-round war against Aldo in October 2014. A second-round knockout loss to McGregor five months ago. I think we saw the effects of the fight game take its toll on Mendes last weekend. Not to take anything away from Edgar's blistering left hook, but Mendes probably could benefit from some rest and recovery. A guy loses three of four fights and there's immediately talk about him jumping a weight class, but that doesn't seem like it's even an option for Mendes. He'd be a weakened ghost at 135 and kid-brother-sized at 155. It was a tough weekend and it's a tough road back to the top for Mendes. No other way to say it.\n\nJoe Lauzon\n\nTUF 22 Finale (lightweights)\n\nLost to Evan Dunham (UD)\n\nThis was a tough one to watch if you're a Lauzon fan. He never got out of the gate, let alone broke into that Lauzon sprint that has won him the most bonuses in UFC history. He was an easy target on the feet for Dunham and looked hesitant initiating the grappling. Lauzon was coming off a run of three wins in his past four fights, but you wonder how far away he is from going the Kenny Florian or Brian Stann route and leaving while he still has his faculties. Lauzon is so intellectual (and likable), he'd be a natural fit in the broadcast booth.\n\nJose Aldo\n\nUFC 194 (featherweight championship)\n\nLost to Conor McGregor (KO1/0:13)\n\nLet the Aldo hot takes begin. As far as a grade goes, he basically fails by default. It was a 13-second fight, so there's not a lot to discuss. I will say this about Aldo, though. He was supposed to be the one featherweight who wouldn't let McGregor get to him. When McGregor jumped the cage in Boston, Aldo didn't flinch. This kid from the favelas wasn't going to be shaken, certainly not by a loud-talking Irishman. And yet, Aldo looked tired by the time UFC 194 arrived. Whether that was due to McGregor or simply that \"Anderson Silva/Georges St-Pierre\" effect of getting weighed down by the enormousness and length of his success, I'm not sure. It's probably a combination of both.\n\nGabriel Gonzaga\n\nTUF 22 Finale (heavyweights)\n\nLost to Konstantin Erokhin (UD)\n\nOne of the surest signs of an old fighter is hesitancy and Gonzaga had that in spades last week. He and Erokhin spent the better part of 15 minutes rhythmically rolling their shoulders and staring at each other from a safe distance. Blame that on some kind of style matchup if you want, but I'll attribute it to the beatings Gonzaga has taken in his past three fights, including back-to-back knockout losses. We've held funerals for heavyweights in the past only to see them come roaring back, but if Gonzaga looks this hesitant again, it will be hard to justify seeing him out there.", "Chicago Bears' Jay Cutler setting records for NOT turning ball over": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- One year after leading the league in turnovers, Jay Cutler is the only NFL quarterback with at least 10 starts this season and zero multi-interception games.\n\nFor the sixth time this season, Cutler did not throw an interception in the Chicago Bears' Week 16 victory against Tampa Bay.\n\nIt\u2019s just the third time in Cutler's 10-year NFL career he has avoided being picked off in six separate games -- 2007 (Broncos) and 2012 (Bears).\n\nNot even Cutler can explain the unexpected turnaround.\n\n\"We\u2019ll take a look at it at the end of the year,\" Cutler said. \"I mean, obviously the numbers are down, so there has to be improvement. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s solely on me, though, with the guys around me, with [offensive coordinator] Adam [Gase] and [quarterbacks coach] Dowell [Loggains], they deserve a lot. They deserve as much credit as I do.\"\n\nOf course, Cutler got lucky that a facemask penalty negated a Buccaneers interception of a tipped ball at the line of scrimmage. He even joked about it after the game.\n\n\"I came off and I was like, 'Yeah, I\u2019m not throwing a screen until 2016. I\u2019m done with screens,' and you got to laugh at that, then you see the flag and you don\u2019t really know what it\u2019s for,\" Cutler said. \"Usually you don\u2019t get that break, so to get that turned around -- I think we went down and scored after that -- that\u2019s a huge break for us.\"\n\nAfter his performance in Tampa (20-of-27 for 156 yards and one touchdown), Cutler\u2019s quarterback rating now stands at a career-best 92.8.\n\nBarring a total meltdown against Detroit, Cutler should end the season with his second-highest completion percentage (63.9) and third-fewest number of single-season interceptions (eight).\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Cutler's lowest single-season interception total (five) came his rookie season in Denver when he started just five games. Cutler tossed seven picks in 2011 but appeared in only 10 games because of a broken thumb.\n\n\"He\u2019s been doing that since I got here,\" Bears guard Matt Slauson said. \"Everything I\u2019ve seen out of him, he\u2019s just an absolute stud. I just think now he\u2019s been put in positions to be successful and guys are working really hard to make sure that Jay\u2019s in a position to be successful. And it just allows Jay to be Jay. This is who I\u2019ve known Jay to be, always, and now the rest of you are getting to see it.\"", "Kenyan champions Stanley Biwott and Mary Keitany put on a marathon masterclass": "Editor's note: This story originally appeared at Competitor.com.\n\nNEW YORK -- Kenyans Mary Keitany and Stanley Biwott turned the 2015 TCS New York City Marathon into a five-borough classroom on Sunday, showing the other elite runners and the rest of the world how to produce 26.2-mile masterpieces.\n\nBoth were almost invisible in big packs that stayed watchfully together halfway through the race, but chose their moments to perfection and finished alone. Keitany won in 2 hours, 24 minutes, 25 seconds after a halfway split of 1:12:56; Biwott's finish was 2:10:34 after a half in 1:06:47. The math says it all.\n\nThe crucial moment came a little earlier for Keitany. She surged at 30K, arms pumping high across her diminutive frame, and instantly blew apart a group of six. Tigist Tufa (Ethiopia), who surprisingly beat Keitany to the win the 2015 London Marathon back in April, stuck close for awhile. Tufa stuck almost too close, as Keitany turned and snarled at her for jostling as they ran side by side through the Bronx.\n\n\"When I made my move around 30K, I say, 'OK, let me just go, and if somebody is more strong, she can come, and we can go. I was ready to go with her, but fortunately they never got me. I was feeling OK,\" Keitany said after the race.\n\nLast week, she told Competitor she was determined not to repeat the mistake she made here in 2011, when she went out crazy-fast and lost a huge halfway lead.\n\nThis time, Keitany had it all under control and soon had all the space she needed. Tufa tightened and drifted back, and the once-fearsome Kenyan Priscah Jeptoo was also history. Ethiopian Aselefech Mergia eventually came through for second, but Keitany was alone and away, relentlessly piling the yards on to her lead. Even on the trying hills through Central Park she was running at 5:13-5:18 per-mile pace and finished, seemingly with strength in reserve, 66 seconds in the clear.\n\nEditor's Picks Retired tennis star Blake finishes NYC Marathon James Blake had success at another iconic New York sporting event.\n\nIt was a supremely efficient racing performance by Keitany, who has made her mistakes in the past, but with Paula Radcliffe now retired, she is arguably the best woman now racing. She is the second-fastest woman (2:18:37) in marathon history behind Radcliffe, and in New York Keitany won her third major marathon (London 2012, New York City 2014). Disposing of Tufa will likely seem especially sweet, because Keitany seemed less than happy after the result in London earlier this year.\n\nBiwott's record has been one of impressive near misses -- a second and a fourth in London, and fifth in New York in 2013. His only win was Paris in 2012. Taller than most Kenyans, he sometimes looks too big and galloping as he looms above the lead pack, but when the action started on Sunday he was flowing.\n\n\"During my previous marathons I was not able to run the last five kilometers at a consistent speed. So for my preparation I trained with a very good program of long runs at the full 42 kilometer distance, not 35. So I was able to have a lot of endurance speed to finish, not running slow at the end. So I was confident, and happy to be the winner, thank you,\" Biwott said.\n\nGeoffrey Kamworor, the immensely promising 22-year-old Kenyan who pushed Mo Farah for the world 10,000-meters track championship over the summer, was the first to break up the pack. Kamworor's move came at what is becoming the traditional spot in the New York City men's race, just after 20 miles. The first major fallout was that the move blew away pre-race favorite and defending champion Wilson Kipsang. There was going to be a new name on the men's trophy.\n\nThere was more drama to come. Kamworor, though light on marathon experience (best of 2:06:12 in 2012), was the obvious threat and at first seemed in command. He has high credentials in track (world-championship silver at 10,000 meters in 2015), cross country (2015 world champion) and the half-marathon (2014 world champion, best of 58:54). That could have added up to a phenomenal first serious marathon.\n\nKamworor was thinking the same.\n\n\"When I decided to make a move, I knew I was feeling strong, and I was feeling OK. I knew I could make it all the way to the finish,\" Kamworor said.\n\nBut the gap we were watching for never came. Biwott and Lelisa Desisa kept it tight. Desisa, who narrowly lost here to Kipsang last year and is a double Boston champion (2013, 2015), was the first to lose his grip. Up the long gradual slope on the 24th mile along Fifth Avenue, it was Biwott who edged in front. Kamworor frowned, Desisa disappeared. Entering Central Park, there was daylight between Biwott and Kamworor, and it slowly increased.\n\nBiwott's endurance training paid off, and he never faltered. His lead had grown to 14 seconds at the tape.\n\nNotable among the top 10 finishers was the Japanese \"citizen runner\" Yuki Kawauchi, who gave Japan one of its best recent placings in sixth place, one ahead of top American Meb Keflizighi.\n\nThere were plenty of lessons for all citizen runners in New York today. Judge it right, run negative splits, and watch for the moment to make the break. But making the break is only half the battle, as Keitany and Biwott proved. Then you have to keep it, nurture it, and make it last all the way.", "Kevin Durant gets aggressive as Thunder rally past Nuggets": "Russell Westbrook scores 30 points and dishes out 12 assists while Kevin Durant scores 26 points with 10 assists as the Thunder put away the Nuggets 122-112. (1:11)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- Coming off a flat performance on Christmas Day against the Chicago Bulls, the Oklahoma City Thunder were expected to run over the shorthanded Denver Nuggets, who were already playing the second night of a back-to-back.\n\nInstead, the Thunder trailed 61-53 at the half and were down by as many as 11 in the second quarter. Defensively, they were sloppy. They were getting routinely beat on the defensive glass. They lacked intensity, they lacked an edge, and they were flirting with the kind of loss that causes fans to drink kerosene as they spit their fiery takes on Twitter.\n\nAs expected, things changed early in the third quarter, and the Thunder rode the momentum to a 69-51 second half, and a 122-112 win. What was the difference?\n\n\"I was aggressive, for one,\" Kevin Durant said. \"Trying [to] score, make plays. And I think when I'm aggressive, that's sets the tone for us. So I was a little more aggressive, had a little more juice and it helped us out.\"\n\nDurant scored 12 of his 26 points on 5-of-8 shooting in the third, clearly intensifying his scoring mindset. With the Nuggets throwing defenders at him such as Kostas Papanikolaou and Will Barton, Durant went to work.\n\nDurant has been intent this season on not only buying into Billy Donovan's reformed vision for the Thunder, but also leading by example. By the minute, Durant is taking the fewest shots in his career. He is averaging just 17.4 attempts a game, which discounting last season when he was on a play-timing restriction, is the lowest since his rookie season.\n\nDurant has had games where he has taken only two shots in a half, or nine total for a game. He has bought in to the idea of a five-man unit playing in a free-flowing manner, and is intent on being a key orchestrator of it.\n\n\"This is a rhythm game, this is a confidence game,\" he said. \"When everybody touches the ball, we play together, not worry about who gets the assist or who scores the points, then everybody feels good. Our offense is going to dictate who scores, who gets the ball, but if we play together, everybody touching it, everybody involved, [those] shots feel a little better leaving your hand.\"\n\nBut he's still the most ruthlessly efficient scorer in the world, and with his absurd near-seven-foot frame, Durant can get a shot basically any time, anywhere. On Sunday, Durant attempted 21, 13 coming in the second half. He wasn't overly assertive, still reading and reacting smartly as he dished out eight of his 10 assists in the third and fourth quarters.\n\nCombine that with the runaway downhill sled that is Russell Westbrook, and the Thunder tend to completely suffocate opponents with relentless offense. In the past, which includes the recent past, like Friday's deflating loss to the Bulls, it's a predictable, two-headed scoring machine that either doesn't get contribution from secondary sources or doesn't encourage it enough. Old habits die hard, especially when it has been your identity for seven seasons running.\n\nBut against the Nuggets, Durant and Westbrook combined for 22 of the team's 27 assists, becoming the first teammates since John Stockton and Karl Malone in 1996 to register at least 25 points and 10 assists in a regulation game. Or there's this: Prior to this season, Durant and Westbrook had never had games in which they both had at least 20 and 10 assists; they've now done it twice in the past month.\n\nAfter being told the Thunder are 8-1 when they have 25 or more assists, Durant raised an eyebrow. \"I guess that's the formula,\" he said. \"We gotta start looking at that.\"\n\nIt's that, but it's also the cohesive marriage of scoring with it. The Thunder can't, and shouldn't, become a team that routinely relies on Durant to set the inclusive tone for the team. That's like asking Clayton Kershaw to not strike out everyone so his defense can practice their fielding.\n\nDurant's and Westbrook's fastballs are their scoring, but mixing it as a distributor unlocks a lot of the potential this Thunder team appears to have. It makes Enes Kanter (21 points on 7-of-8 shooting) better. It makes Serge Ibaka (19 on 9-of-13) better. It even makes each other better.\n\nAnd most importantly, it makes the Thunder a lot better.", "Fantasy Hockey forecaster for the week of December 28 to January 3": "The power play remains the catalyst for fantasy production. Not only are power-play points a category unto themselves in the ESPN standard game, but having the man advantage also drives production of goals, assists, points and shots on goal. Not to mention that the power-play time adds to a player's average time on ice.\n\nAll told, the power play is as good a place as any to attempt to nose out some potential fantasy sleepers. Editor's Picks Fantasy: Defensemen to target in trade right now Sean Allen ranks the top 250 players in fantasy hockey for the rest of the 2015-16 season, Plus, defensemen to target in trade right now based on trends in value against total (VAT).\n\nIn early December, we had a look at shot attempts from an overall perspective. One of the recommendations we made based on the data was that Jeff Skinner was due for a breakout. Skinner and Johnny Gaudreau are tied for the NHL lead with nine goals since that day. That only reinforces the notion that shot attempts are a good place to look for potential breakout value.\n\nIn this exercise, we are looking at shot attempts (shots on goal plus missed shots) specific to the power play. Furthermore, we are identifying players who rank highly for shot attempts per minute on the power play but play a low number of minutes on the man advantage (whether because of injury or limited role so far). The theory is that with more power-play time, they will continue to attempt to score and eventually start to score.\n\nJohnny Boychuk, D, New York Islanders: Having played a distant third among Islanders defensemen for power-play time so far this season, Boychuk has been the most efficient of them. Nick Leddy leads the team with six power-play points from the blue line this season, but he's played more than double the amount of time as Boychuk on the man advantage. Boychuk has three power-play points in just under 40 minutes of power-play time this season and trails only Alex Ovechkin among NHL regulars for shot attempts per minute on the power play. Considering Leddy ranks in the 30s among defensemen for power-play scoring, Boychuk is due for a turn as the main cog on the blue line at some point.\n\nTeemu Pulkkinen, F, Detroit Red Wings: The Red Wings are blessed with plenty of offensive weapons for the power play, but one that is has been under-utilized is Pulkkinen's wicked one-timer. In only 38 minutes of power-play time this season -- 11th among Red Wings -- Pulkkinen has three power-play points and is using his time very efficiently to drive pucks to the net. He ranks fifth in the NHL for shot attempts per minute on the man advantage and is a boost waiting to happen to the Wings' so-so power play once he comes back from a shoulder injury later in January.\n\nMatt Dumba, D, Minnesota Wild: Fourth among Wild for shots on goal on the power play this season, Dumba is 10th on the team in power play ice time. That's a mismatch that is due for some correction. His 17 power-play shots and five power-play missed shots in just shy of 46 minutes of ice time rank him eighth in the NHL for scoring attempts per minute on the man advantage. If the Wild start deploying Dumba more as a second defenseman on the first unit with Ryan Suter, he could be in for a boost in production.\n\nNick Bjugstad, F, Florida Panthers: Sidelined by migraines for the past month, Bjugstad is skating and expected to return to the Panthers lineup sooner than later. That will be good for fantasy owners in the 55-plus percent of leagues where he was dropped. Thirteenth in the NHL for shot attempts per minute on the power play, it would be easy to overlook the fact that Bjugstad has five power-play points already this season and will return as the centerpiece of a dangerous first unit that is finally going to be healthy together. Despite missing a solid month, Bjugstad has more shot attempts on the power play this season than players such as Henrik Zetterberg, Claude Giroux, Anze Kopitar and even Jamie Benn.\n\nFantasy Hockey Forecaster: Dec. 28-Jan. 3 Team Games Ratings Mon\n\n12/28 Tue\n\n12/29 Wed\n\n12/30 Thu\n\n12/31 Fri\n\n1/1 Sat\n\n1/2 Sun\n\n1/3 4 total\n\n1 home O: 2\n\nD: 6 OFF @CGY\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 9 OFF @EDM\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 2 @VAN\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 8 OFF WPG\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 5 3 total\n\n2 home O: 5\n\nD: 2 OFF CHI\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 1 OFF WPG\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 1 OFF @EDM\n\nO: 6\n\nD: 1 OFF 2 total\n\n2 home O: 5\n\nD: 5 OFF OTT\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 8 OFF OFF MTL\n\nO: 2\n\nD: 9 OFF OFF 4 total\n\n3 home O: 1\n\nD: 7 WSH\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 3 OFF @WSH\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 3 NYI\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 10 OFF DET\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 9 OFF 3 total\n\n2 home O: 5\n\nD: 7 OFF ANA\n\nO: 2\n\nD: 10 OFF LA\n\nO: 2\n\nD: 8 OFF @COL\n\nO: 8\n\nD: 5 OFF 3 total\n\n2 home O: 5\n\nD: 1 OFF @NJ\n\nO: 9\n\nD: 4 OFF WSH\n\nO: 3\n\nD: 1 OFF NSH\n\nO: 3\n\nD: 1 OFF 3 total\n\n1 home O: 9\n\nD: 9 OFF @ARI\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 10 OFF @COL\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 10 OFF OFF OTT\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 10 3 total\n\n2 home O: 6\n\nD: 3 @SJ\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 2 OFF OFF CHI\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 1 OFF CGY\n\nO: 7\n\nD: 4 OFF 2 total\n\n2 home O: 3\n\nD: 2 OFF DAL\n\nO: 3\n\nD: 1 OFF OFF OFF WSH\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 1 OFF 4 total\n\n1 home O: 10\n\nD: 6 OFF @CLS\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 7 OFF NSH\n\nO: 9\n\nD: 3 OFF @NJ\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 8 @NYI\n\nO: 7\n\nD: 6 4 total\n\n1 home O: 7\n\nD: 5 @MIN\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 1 @WPG\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 3 OFF PIT\n\nO: 9\n\nD: 5 OFF @BUF\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 9 OFF 3 total\n\n3 home O: 9\n\nD: 6 OFF LA\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 4 OFF ANA\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 9 OFF ARI\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 6 OFF 3 total\n\n3 home O: 4\n\nD: 3 OFF MTL\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 8 OFF OFF OFF NYR\n\nO: 5\n\nD: 1 MIN\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 1 4 total\n\n1 home O: 6\n\nD: 7 @VAN\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 9 @EDM\n\nO: 7\n\nD: 3 OFF @CGY\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 9 OFF PHI\n\nO: 8\n\nD: 10 OFF 4 total\n\n1 home O: 10\n\nD: 7 DET\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 7 OFF OFF @STL\n\nO: 8\n\nD: 7 OFF @TB\n\nO: 8\n\nD: 6 @FLA\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 6 3 total\n\n0 home O: 2\n\nD: 7 @TB\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 10 @FLA\n\nO: 2\n\nD: 10 OFF OFF @BOS\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 9 OFF OFF 4 total\n\n1 home O: 8\n\nD: 7 NYR\n\nO: 6\n\nD: 5 @STL\n\nO: 2\n\nD: 9 OFF @DAL\n\nO: 8\n\nD: 3 OFF @CAR\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 9 OFF 3 total\n\n2 home O: 6\n\nD: 3 OFF CAR\n\nO: 8\n\nD: 4 @OTT\n\nO: 6\n\nD: 6 OFF OFF DAL\n\nO: 2\n\nD: 1 OFF 4 total\n\n1 home O: 7\n\nD: 9 OFF @TOR\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 7 OFF @BUF\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 10 OFF @PIT\n\nO: 8\n\nD: 10 DAL\n\nO: 5\n\nD: 5 3 total\n\n0 home O: 7\n\nD: 5 @NSH\n\nO: 6\n\nD: 6 OFF @TB\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 6 OFF OFF @FLA\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 6 OFF 3 total\n\n1 home O: 4\n\nD: 2 OFF @BOS\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 1 NJ\n\nO: 7\n\nD: 4 OFF OFF OFF @CHI\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 1 2 total\n\n0 home O: 4\n\nD: 3 OFF OFF @SJ\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 3 OFF OFF @LA\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 3 OFF 3 total\n\n2 home O: 5\n\nD: 3 OFF OFF TOR\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 1 @DET\n\nO: 5\n\nD: 2 OFF NYI\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 3 OFF 3 total\n\n3 home O: 7\n\nD: 4 COL\n\nO: 8\n\nD: 2 OFF PHI\n\nO: 6\n\nD: 7 OFF OFF WPG\n\nO: 9\n\nD: 2 OFF 3 total\n\n2 home O: 5\n\nD: 6 OFF NSH\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 9 OFF MIN\n\nO: 3\n\nD: 4 OFF @TOR\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 7 OFF 3 total\n\n3 home O: 4\n\nD: 7 MTL\n\nO: 1\n\nD: 10 OFF NYR\n\nO: 5\n\nD: 7 OFF OFF MIN\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 4 OFF 3 total\n\n2 home O: 8\n\nD: 1 OFF NYI\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 1 @PIT\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 1 OFF OFF TOR\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 1 OFF 2 total\n\n2 home O: 4\n\nD: 6 LA\n\nO: 4\n\nD: 9 OFF OFF OFF ANA\n\nO: 3\n\nD: 10 OFF OFF 4 total\n\n1 home O: 10\n\nD: 10 @BUF\n\nO: 7\n\nD: 10 OFF BUF\n\nO: 7\n\nD: 10 @CAR\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 9 OFF @CLS\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 10 OFF 4 total\n\n1 home O: 9\n\nD: 3 OFF DET\n\nO: 9\n\nD: 1 OFF @ARI\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 2 OFF @SJ\n\nO: 10\n\nD: 1 @ANA\n\nO: 7\n\nD: 6\n\nA busy week in the NHL has 10 teams with four games, which leaves little advantage to a high quantity of games for your skaters. But with so many teams playing more games, it does increase the disadvantage for skaters on the four NHL teams that only play twice. Be wary of your Boston Bruins, Columbus Blue Jackets, Philadelphia Flyers and Vancouver Canucks. Also make backup plans if you are usually leaning on Tuukka Rask, Steve Mason or Ryan Miller to meet your goaltender minimums.\n\nLooking for skaters\n\nWashington Capitals: The Caps easily come out on top of the Forecaster rating table this week, thanks to a favorable schedule that includes a home-and-home set with the Buffalo Sabres, plus visits to the Carolina Hurricanes and Columbus Blue Jackets. Top among pickups to bolster your offense for the week is Marcus Johansson, who is available in 58 percent of ESPN leagues. Getting time on the top power-play unit and the second line with Evgeny Kuznetsov, Johansson is a threat to produce most games. He has three power-play points and four total points during his past three games. Those in search of penalty minutes might want to consider rolling Tom Wilson for the week. His ice time has been good enough to not hamper your team totals since getting time on the third line with Jay Beagle and Jason Chimera. His 81 PIM this season rank third in the league and a four-game schedule is an efficient way to sub him in for a week.\n\nWinnipeg Jets: When the Jets have a good schedule, there are really only two places to dip into the roster for added value in most leagues: Drew Stafford and Tyler Myers. Stafford provides occasional streaks of value on offense thanks to his role and chemistry on the second line with Mark Scheifele and Mathieu Perreault. Stafford is among the top-70 in the NHL for shots on goal both during the month of December and for the whole season. Myers, meantime, was hot going into the holiday break with six points during the final four games.\n\nMinnesota Wild: Charlie Coyle may finally be getting the message to take a few more shots on goal. His seven shots on goal in the final two games before the break were the most he's taken in back-to-back games this season. The result has been goals in two straight. Playing on the third line with Nino Niederreiter and Justin Fontaine somewhat limits his chances, but also plays up as an anchor on the second power-play unit.\n\nLooking for goaltenders\n\nLouis Domingue, G, Arizona Coyotes: Desperate times call for desperate measure. The Coyotes know this as much as fantasy owners with Mike Smith sidelined for a while. Domingue has looked great as the starter in his stead, following Anders Lindback's inability to fill the void. With two wins in two chances, Domingue is in the first chair for now. The matchup with the Chicago Blackhawks to start the week isn't promising, but the next two games against the Jets and Edmonton Oilers might be options to squeeze a start out of Domingue if you need one.\n\nChad Johnson, G, Buffalo Sabres: Weekly leagues will want to look elsewhere as you won't be able to bench Johnson for the home-and-home set with the Capitals to open the week. But daily leagues can get a start out of Johnson later in the week - either against the New York Islanders or Detroit Red Wings at home. Johnson has solid more often than not of late.\n\nQuick hits\n\nThe NHL hits the news doldrums during the holiday break, but here's a list of players to watch for injury updates through the weekend before you set next week's lineup: Sidney Crosby, Marian Hossa, Sergei Bobrovsky, Mike Fisher, Kyle Okposo, Bobby Ryan, Marc-Andre Fleury, Tyler Johnson and James Reimer.", "2015 top quotes of the year": "After a long season filled with highlights, lowlights and memorable moments, we are handing out our 2015 tennis awards.

UFC president Dana White said this week that the rematch will be Holm's next fight, likely at UFC 200 in Las Vegas on July 9.\n\n\"Eight months is a long time between fights, and I don't want to wait that long,\" Holm said before watching UFC 194 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. \"But if that's what it is, I'll do it and I'll be ready.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old Holm (10-0) would prefer to take another fight in the spring, and top bantamweight contender Miesha Tate has campaigned aggressively for a title shot.\n\nHolm would welcome a showdown with Tate, but she realizes the UFC probably won't endanger what's expected to be a lucrative rematch with Rousey (12-1), the sport's biggest star.\n\nAlthough Holm's boxing career conditioned her to prefer several fights each year, she isn't prepared to challenge the UFC's authority to pick the champ's schedule.\n\nHolly Holm, who's stunning Nov. 14 defeat of Ronda Rousey triggered an eventual rematch, says she would like to fight before a second meeting with Rousey, who will need several months to recover from injuries sustained in her loss to Holm. Matt Roberts/USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"I don't really like to lay out a path of what I think is best for me,\" Holm said. \"I just like to take it as it comes. That's why I'm sitting here today. They gave me the fight with Ronda. A lot of people thought it was too early, and I just took the opportunity.\"\n\nHolm utterly dominated Rousey, finishing the former champ with a second-round head kick that loosened her teeth. Holm showed no fear of Rousey's vaunted judo skills, even when they ended up pressed against the cage -- and she ended the fight with a showcase of her superior striking.\n\n\"I think she might try a little harder [to take the fight to the ground],\" Holm said of the rematch. \"I do expect a completely different fight. Nothing ever happens the same, and she'll be coming twice as aggressive. She's going to come back with a vengeance. I know that, and I just have to be ready.\"\n\nHolm has spent the past four weeks on a lengthy goodwill tour celebrating her title. After several stops across the country for talk show appearances and interviews, roughly 20,000 people turned out this month to welcome her home to her native Albuquerque.\n\nHolm spent this week watching fights during the UFC's three-day extravaganza leading up to Conor McGregor's showdown with Jose Aldo. Her celebrity took a quantum leap with her victory over Rousey, and she has been besieged by fans whenever she steps out in the UFC's hometown.\n\n\"We wouldn't have a job without fans, so I try to embrace this,\" Holm said. \"Sometimes I have to have some patience, but I love the fans. We wouldn't be here without them. ... I've had a lot of life-changing moments in my life. Little moments can be life-changing, too. I feel like my life has changed in a good way.\"", "Meb Keflezighi, other Americans look good ahead of Olympic marathon trials": "Editor's note: This story originally appeared at Competitor.com.\n\nNEW YORK - Perhaps they should rename the race the New York City Meb-athon.\n\nOn a day when the lead men seemed content to jog through 20 miles, enjoying the unseasonably late autumn foliage and warm temperatures, the biggest cheers were for American Meb Keflezighi, who in 10 runs through the five boroughs (plus one Olympic Trials in Central Park) has more or less made the Big Apple his own personal stage, even meriting a ride at the head of the city's famed Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade after his 2009 win.\n\nIndeed, the lead men's pack seemed to defer to Keflezighi as they descended the Queensboro Bridge en masse, allowing him to be the honorary leader as they entered the canyon of sound that awaits the runners as they hit First Avenue.\n\nThe pace got serious in the final miles and Keflezighi was left somewhat in arrears -- \"Those guys have leg turnover I don't have anymore,\" he said -- but still managed to finish seventh in 2 hours, 13 minutes, 32 seconds, a time that gave him a pair of masters records for his day's work. Keflezighi's name will now supplant those of former NYC masters course record-holder John Campbell (2:14:34, 1990) and former overall American masters record-holder Mbarak Hussein (2:13:52, Twin Cities, 2006).\n\n\"I've run this race 10 times, and I have stories from every year,\" said Keflezighi, whose training had been hampered by some hamstring problems in the last month. \"I knew the masters records were in reach, and fortunately the pace was slow enough early on that I could run in a pack and get pulled along.\"\n\nKeflezighi will do his usual thorough recovery routine, then gear up for next February's Olympic Trials, where he'll hope to make his fourth U.S. marathon team. \"To represent my country one more time would be amazing, to have my daughters be there old enough to appreciate it -- it won't be easy, but I'll be ready.\"\n\nEditor's Picks Photos: New York City Marathon Take a look at the best images seen around the five boroughs at the 2015 New York City Marathon.\n\nIf Keflezighi's story is well known and seems almost scripted for Hollywood, that of Craig Leon, one place behind Keflezighi (2:15:16) as the second American finisher, is almost equally storybook. A former walk-on distance runner at Ohio University, Leon seemed almost shocked by finishing just behind the American marathoning legend.\n\n\"This might be the worst buildup I've had going into a marathon,\" said Leon, who now trains and works in Eugene, Oregon. \"I had plantar fasciitis that really curtailed my training, and then a month ago I got sick. But that might have been a blessing in disguise, because when I started back running I was pain free, and I felt great during the race. At about 20 miles I thought, 'If I can keep this rolling, I can get a PR [2:13:52],' but that's when the leaders took off and I was kind of on my own the rest of the way.\n\n\"I have no business being with these guys on the track -- I think I've broken 30 minutes twice -- but the one thing I do well is run marathons. I'm as proud of my run today as my race in Boston in 2014 [12th, 2:14:48]. I'll take a few weeks to recover, then start building up for the Trials. I think it's a pretty wide-open race, so I just want to be able to be in the mix.\"\n\nOne person who definitely won't be in Los Angeles for that race is the woman who equaled Keflezighi's performance, finishing seventh overall and as the top American. Before the race -- her marathon debut -- Laura Thweatt had said the marathon trials were not an option, and she stuck to that assertion despite of running an excellent 2:28:23 debut.\n\n\"I still have some unfinished business on the track, and I'm going to focus on the 5,000 and 10,000 at the track trials,\" Thweatt said.\n\nFor someone running her first race at the distance, Thweatt, who won the U.S. cross country championship in February, looked extremely comfortable and confident, even taking the lead for a few moments near the halfway point. But that shouldn't come as a total surprise, because she's coached by Lee Troop, a three-time Olympic marathoner for Australia.\n\n\"She executed just about perfectly,\" said Troop, \"but the whole point was for her to get a taste of what the marathon is like, and build up her strength for track.\"\n\n\"The marathon definitely has its highs and lows,\" said Thweatt. \"Around 20 miles (eventual winner) Mary (Keitany) took off and it was really challenging the rest of the way and I just had to put my head down and grind. The 10,000 is a grind in a different way but today will really help me psychologically.\"\n\nSo for the three top Americans, an autumn's jog through the five boroughs proved to be just what each wanted heading into next year's all-important Olympic buildup.", "Lydia Ko's Impact On The Game Of Golf Extends Well Beyond Her Years": "Lydia Ko's Impact On The Game Of Golf Extends Well Beyond Her Years\n\nProfessional golfer Lydia Ko explains what it means to her to make such an impact on her sport and her fans. NEXT VIDEO\n\nLydia Ko was playing in an LPGA tournament in China the last week of October, so she was a couple of days late in finding out she was on Time magazine's roster of most influential teens for the second straight year.\n\n\"I didn't have very good Internet the first couple of days, but when I was able to look through Twitter I saw I got picked again,\" Ko said in a mid-November interview with espnW.com before the CME Group Tour Championship. \"That's so cool, especially seeing the other teenagers. I see them on TV all the time. I love his song, or I love her fashion. The President's daughter, I get to be on the same list as her. What if President Obama saw it and saw me on there? That would be so cool.\"\n\nNo doubt Malia Obama's father, arguably the most avid golfer to live in the White House since Dwight D. Eisenhower, was aware of Ko before seeing the list of Generation Z notables that includes actress Maisie Williams, singer Shawn Mendes and swimmer Katie Ledecky.\n\nAs her 2015 season reaffirmed, Ko, a South Korean-born, New Zealand-bred 18-year-old, is one of the most precocious sports people of all time. No golfer has ever had so much success at such an early age.\n\n\"It definitely is another level,\" LPGA player Jane Park said. \"She's one in a million.\"\n\nHype and hullabaloo are glued to some athletes who receive big contracts before they are big winners, their sizzle stemming from potential rather than performance. Ko is an understated champion about whom it is difficult to overstate her achievements.\n\nAfter tying for second in the first event of the year, Ko, then 17, rose to the top spot on the Rolex Rankings, the youngest golfer, male or female, to be No. 1 in in the world. After winning three times in 2014, Ko's encore was a five-victory season, giving her 10 career LPGA titles, the first having come in 2012 at the record-breaking age of 15.\n\nThe most important of Ko's 2015 victories was her dominating effort at The Evian Championship in September, when she shot a final-round 63 to defeat Lexi Thompson by six strokes and became the youngest female major champion. At 18 years, 4 months, 20 days, Ko was six months younger than Morgan Pressel was when she won the 2007 Kraft Nabisco. You have to go back to Tom Morris Jr., who was 17 when he captured the 1868 Open Championship in a field of only a dozen competitors, for a younger major winner.\n\nThe Evian was Ko's last chance to break Pressel's record. She uncharacteristically had struggled in two of the LPGA's five majors in 2015, tying for 51st in the ANA Championship and missing the cut for the first time in 54 LPGA events at the KPMG Women's PGA Championship, but there was a sense that Ko would get it done in her low-key way in France.\n\n\"She's a very humble sort of person. She's not one to shout from the rooftops,\" said David Leadbetter, who has coached Ko for two years. \"But she was pretty confident she was going to play well that week. Certain players have that little bit of magic about them in that they do what is needed at the time. It was a challenge for her, and she's amazing in how she seems to rise to the occasion.\"\n\nKo cried on that triumphant Sunday in France and again two months later, following the season-ending event in Naples, Florida. Cristie Kerr won the CME Group Tour Championship, but Ko held off Inbee Park to become Rolex Player of the Year and claim her second consecutive $1 million Race to the CME Globe bonus.\n\nNot only is Ko the youngest player of the year, an award the LPGA has given since 1966, she joins Hall of Famers Nancy Lopez, Beth Daniel and Annika Sorenstam as the only players to be the tour's leading golfer the season after being its best rookie.\n\n\"She's just different. She's special,\" Ko's mother, Tina, said after her younger daughter's last round of 2015. \"We cannot explain this type of thing. We didn't think she would be this good.\"\n\nA decade ago, Michelle Wie was the \"it\" teen of women's golf, a tall and long-hitting Hawaiian who played in a PGA Tour event when she was just 14 and accumulated a startling six top-five finishes in major championships before her 17th birthday. Yet Wie didn't win an LPGA tournament until she was 20 and, at 26, having taken time out to go to Stanford and having struggled with her putter and with injuries, has only four career victories.\n\n\"Michelle came on the scene with such eye-popping ability,\" Hall of Famer and ESPN analyst Judy Rankin said. \"The first time you saw Lydia, you're thinking, 'Gee, she's a nice player. She could really do something someday.' Only you didn't realize some day was tomorrow. Lydia has accomplished as a teenager what it seemed like Michelle was destined for. I was on a radio show in New Zealand this year and suggested by the time Lydia was 20, she could have 20 wins. It wouldn't surprise me.\"\n\nIf Ko reaches the milestone Rankin mentioned, it probably won't change her even-keeled approach to golf, which Leadbetter calls \"the perfect temperament for the game.\" When Ko shot a career-best 61 at this year's ISPS Handa New Zealand Women's Open, she knew it could have been better.\n\n\"It's a great day at the office,\" she said later in the year. \"I still felt, 'Hey, I was that close to maybe shooting 59.' There is no perfect round.\"\n\nKo is taking online psychology courses at a Korean college, not only because the subject matter interests her but because the knowledge could enhance her life and her golf.\n\n\"I've never really sat down and said, 'Hey, why are you so good?'\" Ko said. \"I've got so many things to learn and so many things I can possibly do. I feel like I'm not fantastic. I'm not this legend or this god. If I was, I could be winning every week. That's what gods do.\"\n\nIn Ko's desire to improve, Leadbetter sees a resemblance to his most famous former student.\n\n\"In her single purpose, she's sort of a happier [Nick] Faldo,\" Leadbetter said, referring to the six-time major champion. \"She's a perfectionist who doesn't like hitting a poor shot. Even on the practice green she doesn't like missing short putts, same as Nick. But she's probably a lot more accepting when things aren't perfect that she can get it back. You never really see her miserable about it.\"\n\nTina Ko said Lydia \"was born to be nice.\" If so, she hasn't grown out of it, endearing herself to fellow players, LPGA staff and spectators with kind and genuine ways that underpin her personality.\n\n\"She's so down to earth, not a mean bone in her body,\" Park said. \"Can't hurt a fly. She's just so humble and gracious and very thankful for her talent and all the great opportunities her talent has given her.\"\n\nOne of my favorite things is when a junior comes up to me at an event, or on social media, and says, 'You're my role model.' That's one of the biggest things that inspires me and makes me feel like I have to be better for them. If I can play a part in maybe making the tour a little bit better, it's a job well done. Lydia Ko\n\nMeghan Flanagan, the LPGA's senior coordinator of tour media, has interacted with Ko a lot the past couple of seasons. Ko's golf skills aren't the only thing that stand out.\n\n\"She has that gift of treating the regular people like superstars and the superstars like regular people,\" Flanagan said. \"We get a lot of requests, a lot of demands for her time, and seen very few times where she has looked or seemed overwhelmed. If she doesn't want to do something, she'll probably do it anyway.\"\n\nKo takes the mantle of being a star player more seriously than she takes herself, aware of how much the LPGA's pioneer players and subsequent generations gave of themselves to help the tour thrive.\n\n\"One of my favorite things is when a junior comes up to me at an event, or on social media, and says, 'You're my role model,'\" Ko said. \"That's one of the biggest things that inspires me and makes me feel like I have to be better for them. If I can play a part in maybe making the tour a little bit better, it's a job well done.\"\n\nThis year was not only a time of success but also transition for Ko, whose sister, Sura, 27, was hired by Ko's management company, IMG Golf, and began traveling with her on tour in the spring. (One of Sura's duties is making the crust-free peanut butter sandwiches her little sister likes to eat during rounds.) Sura accompanied Lydia to the Sime Darby LPGA event in Malaysia, the first pro tournament Lydia attended without one of her parents.\n\n\"I just had fun,\" Lydia said. \"Went out most nights with Christina [Kim], Jessica [Korda], Michelle [Wie]. In five or six years' time, when my mom and dad get old, they might not be able to travel that often. It might just be my sister and I together.\"\n\nAustralian Jason Hamilton, Ko's caddie, said his boss \"is kind of growing into a young lady. I don't see a lot of changes because I'm with her all the time, but I've met people who haven't seen her in a year or whatever, and they go, 'Oh, she's so much more mature and growing into her own person.' Not rebelling against her parents, but having her own opinions.\"\n\nWhen Ko isn't playing or practicing, golf doesn't consume her.\n\n\"She normally goes through the yardage book before she goes to bed,\" Sura said. \"That's the only time that we're talking about the golf thing. Other than that, we're talking about boyfriends and gossip and shopping lists.\"\n\nDespite her outstanding season, increasing independence and growing stature in the game, Ko has a public profile much different from the pop-culture figures among Time's influential teens. In Orlando, Florida, where she now lives, Ko said she rarely is recognized away from the golf course.\n\n\"Once, when I went to Universal [Studios],\" she said, \"and this year on the boat on the way to Alcatraz [to film a video]. When I go back home to New Zealand, I get recognized more when I'm out.\"\n\nIf Ko ever draws attention to herself, it's with an occasional silly selfie on Instagram, not from over-the-top emotions on the course or outrageous behavior off it. There is an unassuming, blue-collar approach to her high-end game, which might never fascinate casual fans to a level commensurate to her talent.\n\n\"She's considerate of others, respectful of the other players,\" Leadbetter said. \"Everybody loves her. She's like their little sister. She just happens to be kicking their butts. You know the competitive drive is in there, but it's very hard to see it. I think that's the beauty with her. She disregards the competition. It's about creating little goals for herself and the results taking care of themselves. It's not, 'I have to win. I have to beat her. I hope she three-putts.'\"\n\nLeadbetter could just as easily have been talking about Ko's 22-year-old counterpart on the PGA Tour, player of the year Jordan Spieth, who is more demonstrative when he is playing than Ko but is another young person known for his grace as well as his golf.\n\n\"I've never met him, but I would love to meet him,\" Ko said of Spieth. \"He's awesome. If there's a word more than fantastic or unbelievable, he's that. Even if he's not hitting it perfectly, he's still great and makes birdies from everywhere. He's so calm, but at the same time has that fire. That's so cool.\"\n\nThat description sounds a lot like her, Ko is told.\n\nShe laughs, like a teenager, not a tour pro. \"I don't know,\" Ko said, \"but I'd love to meet him.\"\n\nThe feeling is probably mutual.", "#AskESPNCaddie -- Can the Masters get here any sooner?": "Think we'll ever see players where shorts in tournament play?

That isn't a recipe for success for a rookie big man who shoots only 41.5 percent and doesn't contribute much in terms of assists, blocks and steals.\n\nRight now, he's basically a less efficient, lower-scoring version of Zach Randolph -- a big man who flirts with double-doubles on a nightly basis but adds little other than points and rebounds. There's no reason he should be owned in four out of five ESPN leagues.\n\nNikola Mirotic\n\nSF/PF\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nPercent owned: 72.6\n\nIt's been hard for many fantasy owners to part with Mirotic, and it's understandable. The second-year forward has proved to be a useful, versatile fantasy asset at points in his young NBA career. That said, he also is playing inconsistent minutes and is still trying to come out of an offensive slump. Editor's Picks Fantasy NBA cheat sheet: Surprises and slumps We round up our best Insider basketball tips from the past week to help you with your fantasy basketball lineups, including slumping rookies and surprisingly productive performers.\n\nMirotic put up 23 points in 40 minutes Saturday against Dallas but didn't play more than 25 minutes or score more than eight points in any of the previous five games. If he follows the big game against the Mavericks with a few more duds, you may want to search out more reliable options.\n\nUnder-owned\n\nTaj Gibson\n\nPF/C\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nPercent owned: 28.2\n\nGibson has played 33 minutes or more in each of the three games since Joakim Noah went down, averaging 11.7 points, 9 rebounds and 2.3 assists during that span. The veteran big man can also be counted on to block shots -- he has averaged 1.3 rejections per game over the course of his career -- and should be on more fantasy teams for the next two to four weeks while Noah is out.\n\nThe Bulls play four games this week, so it's a good time to add him.\n\nRodney Hood\n\nSG/SF\n\nUtah Jazz\n\nPercent owned: 21.4\n\nI like to think of Hood as an overlooked version of J.J. Redick. They offer the same things as far as fantasy is concerned -- points and 3-point shooting -- but the difference is Hood is owned in only about a quarter of ESPN leagues and Redick is owned in more than 80 percent.\n\nThat should change now that Alec Burks (leg) is sidelined, because Hood is going to need to play a bigger role. The polished second-year swingman has averaged 29.9 minutes a game this season, but that will likely rise into the mid-30s as long as Burks is out of the lineup.\n\nKelly Olynyk\n\nPF/C\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nPercent owned: 18.4\n\nOlynyk and the Celtics play only two games this week, which makes him more of a stash option than anything. But the bottom line is he's available in more than 80 percent of ESPN leagues despite averaging 13.4 points, 6.4 rebounds and two 3s a game over the past five games. Those are numbers you simply can't overlook, and it's never easy to find 3-point shooting from a big man, which adds to Olynyk's value.\n\nHere's the other thing to love about the former Gonzaga star: Any time an injury to a starter thrusts him into the starting lineup -- like last week when Amir Johnson missed a few games -- he becomes a fantasy stud.", "Don't write off Tiger Woods too soon": "ESPN anchor Hannah Storm reflects on a week in which the futures of Peyton Manning, Kobe Bryant and Tiger Woods have all been up in the air due to injury or impending retirement. (1:48)\n\nTiger Woods left little room for optimism when he spoke in the Bahamas a week ago about a his near-crippling back pain and a prognosis that offers no indication if and when he will return to golf.\n\nHence, the initial takes were understandably dire, Woods questioning his own ability to return to a level of golf once taken for granted, his blunt assessment so far from the ever-optimistic view for which he has always been known, even at the worst of times.\n\nHowever, Woods never said he was retiring, never said there would be no comeback, and as the days progressed at the Hero World Challenge -- where Woods was as visible as he's ever been in any non-playing capacity -- he transmitted a \"don't count me out, yet\" vibe in various impromptu conversations and interviews.\n\nFollowing his news conference at the event that benefits the Tiger Woods Foundation in which he said \"there is no light at the end of the tunnel\" as far as rehab and getting back to golf and anything accomplished from this point \"is gravy,\" Woods did subsequent interviews in which he painted a realistic picture but scoffed at the idea that retirement is near.\n\n\"I was being honest,\" Woods told Global Golf Post's Ron Green Jr. \"As of now, I don't know. I need to get my body healthy enough so I'm able to get back at it. All my surgeons and physios [say] I will be able to get back out but there's no timetable when that is.\"\n\nEven in the Time Magazine interview that he did a few weeks ago and was published last week, Woods made it clear that he \"absolutely\" could see himself at the top again, but that he needs to get well and \"I don't think I'll ever be 100 percent healthy.\"\n\nTiger Woods might be in the midst of the most difficult injury-laden period of his career. But based on his visibility at the Hero World Challenge, Woods is not nearly ready to step away from golf. Scott Halleran/Getty Images\n\nThe 14-time major champion couldn't hit a shot at the tournament he has won five times but was a frequent presence nonetheless at Albany Golf Club. He was at the pro-am party on Wednesday and another gathering hosted Thursday night by the Hero Corp., which sponsors the tournament, as well as a spectator on the golf course.\n\nOne day he drove his kids, Samantha and Charlie, around on a golf cart, pausing to watch play on the course while also signing autographs and posing for photos. He chatted with players, caddies, media -- and did so throughout the week.\n\nAnd there were his stints in the broadcast booth, for both Golf Channel and NBC, where he offered interesting analysis of several players in the field while also addressing his own situation.\n\n\"I understand this is very different,\" he said during the telecast on Sunday. \"Does that mean I'm not going to rehab, I'm not going to train, and not going to fight to get back? Of course I am. I'm far from being done, but I have to be patient, which I am not very good at when it comes to that side of it.\"\n\nHindsight suggests that Woods returned too soon from March 31, 2014, back surgery. And that another break starting in August of last year wasn't long enough, either. And that he rushed to get his game ready for the major championships in 2015, only to suffer the indignity of missing the cut in the last three major championships.\n\nWoods' swing and game were far from a refined product when he played his last round at the Wyndham Championship in August, and all of this time away is not allowing him to refine those aspects of a player who was having difficulty putting all the parts together.\n\nIf he is serious about being patient, that might be the best sign if there is going to be a future inside the ropes. At this point, what's the rush?\n\nEditor's Picks Harig: Top players cash in at Hero World Challenge At a tournament like the Hero World Challenge, the rich get richer, and we're not just talking about the cash.\n\nHarig: Woods nowhere near a return to golf Barely able to walk after three back procedures, Tiger Woods isn't focused on golf right now. His first priority is his quality of life.\n\nAiling Tiger says he has 'no answer' on return Tiger Woods says he has \"no answer\" about when he'll be able to play golf again and that he hasn't begun rehabilitation after back procedures. 2 Related\n\nIt might also be suggested that in addition to taking his time, Woods could find other avenues to satisfy his workout cravings. Perhaps the pool or the elliptical machine as opposed to running; stretching and core work as opposed to heavy weights; maybe even reinventing himself, worrying less about power. \"Golf offers so many ways to get it done,\" he admitted. \"I can be more efficient.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Woods seemed to enjoy being at the tournament, watching and socializing. True, the event had a limited number of spectators, so he was never in danger of being swarmed, as would be the case at a regular tour stop. But you get the sense he missed being around his peers, the good-natured trash talk part of it.\n\nFor all the examples of Woods' insular nature as he racked up the victories, he has undoubtedly taken a liking to many of today's star players. He shows genuine respect for Jordan Spieth, gets along quite well with Rickie Fowler -- Woods and Fowler are both members at the Medalist Golf Club in South Florida -- and has found an eager listener in Jason Day, who has peppered him with questions.\n\nIt wasn't all that long ago when during a casual conversation Woods remarked he was amazed at the lack of questions young players asked him, as he had done with the game's greats over the years, including Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Seve Ballesteros, Raymond Floyd and many more.\n\nA light seemed to go off when it was suggested to Woods that perhaps they were afraid to ask.\n\nWhatever the case, he enjoyed the banter, and maybe being around that again gave him a new sense of purpose, even if he still can barely bend over to tie his shoes.\n\nThat is not to suggest this will be easy, or that he will find any level of success when he does return. But that is the key -- he plans to return.\n\nAs the tournament was concluding on Sunday, Woods was in the player dining area with his daughter, Sam, engaging with sponsors and volunteers as well as saying thanks and goodbyes to the players. He couldn't resist the urge to make a Rose Bowl bet (Stanford vs. Iowa) with Zach Johnson -- who beat him in a playoff at this very tournament two years ago, the last time Woods had a shot at victory.\n\n\"I'll see you next year,\" Woods said to a reporter after chatting for a few minutes. \"I don't know when exactly, but I'll see you next year.\"\n\nAt a golf tournament? That clearly remains a mystery.", "Denver Broncos prepping to start Brock Osweiler again as Peyton Manning continues rehab": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Denver Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said Tuesday \"nothing's changed'' in the team's quarterback plan, so Brock Osweiler will prepare to start the Broncos' regular-season finale Sunday against the San Diego Chargers.\n\nIt will be Osweiler's seventh consecutive start. Kubiak said he will also meet with Peyton Manning either Tuesday evening or Wednesday to talk about what level of participation Manning will have in the team's practices this week.\n\nManning, who suffered a torn plantar fascia near his left heel in the Broncos' Nov. 8 loss in Indianapolis, has practiced twice -- on a limited basis on Dec. 16 and Dec. 17 -- since he was removed from the Broncos' Nov. 15 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAsked Tuesday about what the plan was for Manning this week, Kubiak said, \"[We'll] sit down and talk about that, but nothing's changed. We'll proceed just like we have.''\n\nKubiak had said \"nothing's changed'' on the quarterback situation immediately after Monday night's 20-17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals that officially clinched a playoff spot for the Broncos.\n\nOsweiler is now 4-2 in his six starts, including overtime wins over New England and Cincinnati -- two teams in the AFC's playoff field -- and he has completed 61 percent of his passes with nine touchdowns and four interceptions.\n\nAsked after Monday's game whether he believed he should remain the starter, Osweiler said:\n\n\"I'm not focused on that. ... The focus moving forward will be San Diego and very quick. We're coming onto a short week. We know that San Diego is going to give us their best shot. They have a lot of talented players. I'm not concerned with the quarterback situation. I'm going to show up whether I'm the starter or whether I'm the backup. I'm going to prepare the same exact way. I'm going to be the same exact guy in that building regardless of the situation. The focus needs to be on San Diego.''\n\nManning did not practice with the team last week but had four throwing sessions, including one on Sunday, that included members of the Broncos' strength and conditioning staff as well as practice squad wide receiver Jordan Taylor.\n\n\"He was good. He worked really well last week,'' Kubiak said Tuesday. \"The week before we went a couple days and didn't get through Friday. Last week we got through, actually four days when all was said and done because he worked some more Sunday. ... He had four good days of work. We'll sit down and talk about it and see where we go from there.''", "Todd Bowles' poise, no-nonsense approach is exactly what New York Jets need": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- His young children in tow, Todd Bowles was heading from his news conference to his locker room, the winners' locker room, when he stopped for a moment to talk about a vanquished opponent -- Bill Belichick -- who is not in the habit of losing the kind of mind games he'd just lost to the New York Jets.\n\nAsked during the week about his relationship with the man who has owned the Jets every bit as much as Woody Johnson has, Bowles said, \"I don't have one.\" But after the rookie head coach benefited from the rare Belichickian audible gone terribly wrong -- the decision to kick to the Jets after winning the overtime coin toss -- Bowles sounded like a man interested in establishing a future relationship based on achievement, and not on the empty bluster that defined his predecessor, Rex Ryan.\n\n\"He's unbelievably great,\" Bowles told ESPN.com about Belichick, not Ryan. \"I don't know if beating him means too much to my team because it was such a crucial situation for us, but I have the utmost respect for him as a person and as a coach. They are a great team, man. They've clinched [a playoff spot] already, and we're trying to get where they are.\"\n\nEditor's Picks Jets control own destiny with crazy, wild, hard-to-explain win over Pats\n\nBrandon Marshall and Eric Decker continue to be a magical combination The Jets receivers have put up amazing numbers every week. This game, they were difference-makers in a big way. 1 Related\n\nTold his no-nonsense, robo-tone approach resembles Belichick's, minus the confrontational edge (for now), Bowles laughed out loud and said, \"I hope it's not looks.\" He said Belichick shook his hand after the Jets' 26-20 victory, told him it was a good game and immediately moved on to the New England Patriots' next and final chance to lock down the No. 1 seed on the AFC side of the postseason bracket.\n\n\"I'm sure they're not going to lose too much sleep over it,\" Bowles said. \"We needed it more than they did. We're just trying to play the game the right way and not get too high over a win or too low over a loss, because that affects you the next week. ... But you can't sit back and exhale until the season's over. I can exhale for two hours and then it's like, 'Oh s---, it's Buffalo on Monday.' That's the life of a coach.\"\n\nIt has been a distinguished life for the 52-year-old Bowles, a tough guy from a tough town, Elizabeth, New Jersey, about 18 miles from the MetLife Stadium scene of his best day as a football coach. A day when Bowles strongly suggested he is the perfect antidote to Ryan's buffoonery and, more important, that he is capable of building a program Belichick respects and even admires.\n\nThe Jets had squandered a 17-3 third-quarter lead to a franchise that has forever tormented them, and all the signs pointed toward the death of the home team's four-game winning streak and the clinching of New England's home-field advantage through the playoffs. It didn't matter that injuries forced Belichick to pull offensive linemen and skill-position guys out of the cheap seats, or that Tom Brady was taking a fierce pounding for most of the game. On fourth-and-9 in the closing minutes, the great quarterback found his equally great tight end, Rob Gronkowski, for a 26-yard catch made next-to-impossible by the fact the Jets' big-hitting safety, Calvin Pryor, tried to saw Gronk in half.\n\nBrady threw a touchdown pass to a wide-open James White on the next play, and nobody in the stands wearing a faded Keyshawn Johnson or Wayne Chrebet jersey thought he or she was heading for a happy ending. Even when Belichick ordered one of his captains, Matthew Slater, to defer in the event the Patriots won the overtime toss, those fatalistic Jets fans had to be thinking Belichick was assuming his usual role of Lucy, about to pull the ball away from an always unsuspecting Charlie Brown.\n\nRemember, the Jets haven't appeared in the Super Bowl since the year man stepped on the moon, while Belichick is no less a Super Bowl fixture than that ungodly media day. The last time Belichick made an apparently bizarre endgame choice, he was refusing to call timeout in February while staring across the field at his Super Bowl counterpart, Seattle's Pete Carroll, who was melting down at the worst possible time.\n\nBowles didn't have his team near the goal line, ready to two-peat at the Patriots' expense. This wasn't a title game Sunday, even if it felt that way for the Jets. They knew they had to win to protect their playoff hopes. Just as Bowles suggested, they needed to prevail more than the Patriots did.\n\nSo Ryan Fitzpatrick took the gift-wrapped ball and advanced it 80 yards in five plays. He hit Quincy Enunwa for a big play, Brandon Marshall for a big play and Eric Decker for the biggest play -- a six-yard touchdown pass at the expense of Malcolm Butler, Super Bowl hero -- before the Jets started celebrating New Year's Eve a bit early.\n\n\"I was a little disappointed,\" Marshall said. \"Before the game, I broke the team down and I said, 'When we win, don't act like you won the Super Bowl.' And we won, then everyone stormed the field. Freaking fireworks goes off. I guess they enjoyed the moment.\"\n\nFor good reason, too. This was only the fifth time the Jets have won at least 10 games in a season since Brady became New England's starter early in 2001; Brady and Belichick have reached double figures 14 times over the same period.\n\nThe stadium-wide talk afterward centered on Belichick's coin-toss call; Slater, curious about the first-possession-touchdown-ends-the-game rule, kept asking his coach if he was sure he wanted to go through with it. \"I think he was looking at me like, 'Are you concussed?' \" said Slater, who could've chosen his words more carefully given the current climate around the league and in movie theaters near you.\n\nOh well. The Jets later committed an unforced error of their own, retweeting Belichick's quote on the gambit (\"We thought that was the best thing to do.\") and adding the word, \"Agreed.\" The Jets have no business tweaking a coach who has dominated them and repeatedly has validated his decision to run away from them after Bill Parcells quit way back when.\n\nThey had every right to pump up their own coach for leading them in a poised and dignified way. Bowles hired the right offensive coordinator, Chan Gailey, to get the most out of Fitzpatrick, who arrived in New Jersey with a career record of 33-55-1. Under Bowles, Marshall became the first Jet to catch 100 passes in a season, and Bowles' defense has played at the same high level reached by his Arizona defense. The Jets also have shown a resilience not seen in Ryan's final four years, a resilience embodied Sunday by Enunwa (who overcame a critical drop) and by Fitzpatrick (who overcame his strip-sack fumble that gave New England a touchdown).\n\nMarshall said Bowles inspired this culture change after the loss in Houston dropped the Jets to 5-5, when he ripped into his team for blowing opportunity after opportunity. The coach cut an underperforming player, Quinton Coples, a former first-round pick who had played loud music on the flight home, and then lit into his team again.\n\nCalvin Pace, 13-year NFL veteran, said those post-Houston speeches were the angriest he has seen Bowles in the regular season. \"He's not a vocal guy,\" Pace said, \"but when he speaks, his message comes across and speaks volumes. We knew that he meant business, and it changed us.\"\n\nPace called Bowles' hot-and-heavy training camp \"hell,\" which would be a fairly accurate description for what the Jets will experience if they lose a playoff berth next weekend at Ryan's place. But win, lose or draw in Buffalo, Bowles accomplished something Sunday that can't be destroyed in three hours of Week 17 football.\n\nHe has set a tone of consistency and professionalism that was supposed to be the trademark of their losing friends next door, the Giants, the same consistency and professionalism he showed as a championship player in Washington.\n\n\"We haven't arrived yet,\" Bowles warned.\n\nBut he has, the tough guy from Elizabeth. The rookie coach just beat a Hall of Famer at his own game, and when it was over, Bill Belichick said a lot while saying little. He called the Jets \"well-coached.\" He said Todd Bowles' players \"did their job.\"", "Drew Brees conf\u00eda en seguir junto a Sean Payton con los Saints": "METAIRIE -- En una entrevista este martes con NFL Network, Drew Brees indic\u00f3 que no cree que haya ning\u00fan escenario en el que \u00e9l o el entrenador en jefe Sean Payton no est\u00e9n de vuelta con los New Orleans Saints la pr\u00f3xima temporada.\n\nCon el equipo perfilado para terminar con su segunda temporada perdedora de manera consecutiva y enfrentando importantes preocupaciones con el tope salarial, ha habido gran especulaci\u00f3n sobre el futuro de ambos.\n\nSean Payton y Drew Brees aseguraron su segunda temporada perdedora consecutiva. USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"Se elabor\u00f3 un plan durante la temporada baja pasada en cuanto a c\u00f3mo \u00edbamos a construir las bases para competir en el futuro\", declar\u00f3 Brees. \"Eso incluye nuevos rostros, incluye a jugadores j\u00f3venes. Creo que todos tenemos la oportunidad de unirnos y construir lo que ser\u00e1 un equipo que realmente sea contendiente.\n\n\"Desafortunadamente, ten\u00edamos altas expectativas este a\u00f1o y nos quedamos cortos. Conf\u00edo en que con el car\u00e1cter, el liderazgo, el talento que tenemos ahora exista en ese equipo con el que podremos ser contendientes\".\n\nBrees, quien cumple 37 a\u00f1os de edad el pr\u00f3ximo mes, est\u00e1 programado para ganar 20 millones ded\u00f3lares en salario y bonificaciones en el 2016, el \u00faltimo a\u00f1o de su contrato. Su impacto en el tope salarial ser\u00e1 de 30 millones, el m\u00e1s alto para cualquier jugador al menos desde el 2002, de acuerdo a ESPN Stats & Information. Eso hace probable que los Saints busquen una extensi\u00f3n de contrato con Brees para reducir su impacto en el tope salarial del 2016, sobre todo porque ya est\u00e1n por encima del tope salarial proyectado de 150 millones para el pr\u00f3ximo a\u00f1o con s\u00f3lo 41 jugadores bajo contrato.\n\nSi los Saints canjearan o cortaran a Brees, tendr\u00edan que hacerlo antes del 10 de febrero, cuando 10.85 millones de su salario ser\u00e1n totalmente garantizados.\n\nPayton tiene dos a\u00f1os restantes en su contrato, pero se espera que otros equipos pregunten si podr\u00eda estar disponible la pr\u00f3xima semana.\n\nDurante su entrevista con NFL Network este martes, Brees tambi\u00e9n ofreci\u00f3 su apoyo para su rival de la NFC Sur, Cam Newton, en su candidatura para Jugador M\u00e1s Valioso de la NFL.\n\n\"Sin duda [creo que se lo merece]. Creo que ha jugado fenomenal\", se\u00f1al\u00f3 Brees sobre el mariscal de campo de los Carolina Panthers. \"Creo que lo m\u00e1s impresionante con \u00e9l es su capacidad para lanzar el bal\u00f3n. Obviamente es un tipo que puede hacer muchas jugadas haciendo muchas cosas distintas. Correr con el bal\u00f3n, escaparse, lanzar el bal\u00f3n campo abajo, pero creo que lo que m\u00e1s me ha impresionado es su capacidad para mantenerse en la bolsa de protecci\u00f3n y soltar el bal\u00f3n, en pases cortos, intermedios y largos y en situaciones bajo presi\u00f3n.\n\n\"Sin duda creo que merece el premio\".", "Jason Garrett deserves blame for Dallas Cowboys' horrendous offense": "IRVING, Texas -- Jason Garrett, hired by the Dallas Cowboys as an innovative offensive mind and play-caller in 2007, coaches the NFL's most pathetic offense.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers have scored fewer points and the Indianapolis Colts have totaled fewer yards, but neither of those bad offenses had three offensive linemen named to the Pro Bowl, tight end Jason Witten for 16 games and Dez Bryant for 10 games when the playoffs were still a possibility.\n\nNo offense in the league has done less with more than Garrett\u2019s group. The numbers that matter most to Garrett are worse than pathetic.\n\nYes, the Cowboys have had injuries, but blame for the team's inept offense falls on coach Jason Garrett. Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Cowboys have scored just 252 points, 31st in the NFL, and they rank last in the NFL in red zone touchdown percentage (41.4) and pass plays of 20 yards or more (32).\n\nThis is the worst offense since Jerry Jones brought in Garrett as offensive coordinator. Garrett had never been in charge of an offense that had scored fewer than 361 points before this season. The past two seasons, the Cowboys scored 439 and 467 points, respectively.\n\nSure, Scott Linehan calls the plays, but this is Garrett\u2019s offense and he deserves the credit when it works and the blame when it doesn\u2019t. Linehan isn\u2019t doing anything with the offense or play selection that Garrett doesn\u2019t want.\n\nThe obvious answer to the issues -- the easy one -- is that Tony Romo has started and finished just two games, and the Cowboys won both of those.\n\nSo what?\n\nIf Garrett\u2019s offense can\u2019t function without Romo under center, where he excels at consistently getting the offense into the best possible play, then it\u2019s worthless.\n\nGarrett loves to say the Cowboys\u2019 offense is flexible, able to take advantage of any matchup created by a formation. But it\u2019s a timing-based scheme that is based almost entirely on a receiver or running back winning a one-on-one matchup.\n\nThat\u2019s great when Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin, Emmitt Smith and Jay Novacek are the epicenter of the offense. And it\u2019s fine when Romo, Bryant, DeMarco Murray and Witten are the central figures in every game plan.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen what happens when the Cowboys don\u2019t have a significant skill advantage at receiver, running back or quarterback: The offense becomes abject.\n\nWe\u2019re talking about a unit that has failed to score more than one touchdown in each of the past seven games.\n\nKellen Moore is the fourth quarterback the Cowboys have used this season, and despite all of the hype surrounding the 6-foot, 200-pound lefty with a storage unit of intangibles, he has been the worst of the bunch through six quarters.\n\nOptimists see glimmers of potential and hope, while realists see a dude with a pop-gun arm who can\u2019t consistently throw the deep outs, which are fundamental to this offense\u2019s success.\n\nHe\u2019s probably good enough to be a solid No. 3 quarterback, but he\u2019s probably not good enough to be the backup on a team on which you have to expect a starter such as Romo to miss a few games per season.\n\nThe Cowboys are 1-10 when someone other than Romo starts this season. It\u2019s enough to make you wonder about the fate of the franchise when Romo eventually retires.\n\nIt\u2019s not like Brandon Weeden, Matt Cassel or Moore have showed vast improvement under Garrett, Linehan and quarterbacks coach Wade Wilson.\n\nEach regressed, though Weeden managed to end his 11-game losing streak as a starter Sunday, when he led the Houston Texans to win over the hapless Tennessee Titans. Dallas released Weeden in November and Houston picked him up.\n\nFor now, Garrett has no concrete answers for why the Cowboys' offense has been so bad. He blames inconsistent execution and the lack of big plays.\n\nWhen he sits down with Jerry Jones after this wretched season ends, he needs to have a better answer. Jones has spent too much money and too many draft picks on the offense to have the league\u2019s worst unit.", "Boxing fight schedule": "DECEMBER\n\nDec. 29\n\nAt Bethlehem, Pa.

The four-time overall champion was unhurt and continued his run, finishing second behind Norwegian winner Henrik Kristoffersen.\n\n\"It was huge luck that Marcel was not hurt,\" Waldner said. \"I am very angry.\"\n\nThe company responsible for the camera drone, sports-marketing agency Infront, said in a statement that \"the circumstances leading to [the crash] are currently being examined.\"\n\nWATCH: Skier almost crushed by falling drone during run. https://t.co/hyGYUJKTOc pic.twitter.com/dOlViauMLz NBC Sports (@NBCSports) December 22, 2015\n\n\"I didn't know what it was, but I felt something,\" said Hirscher, who was unhurt and continued his run. \"I thought it was a course worker behind me, or a gate.\n\n\"This is horrible. This can never happen again. This can be a serious injury. ... There are a lot of cool things nowadays. But you have to guarantee the safety -- and that was just insane.\"\n\nAccording to Waldner, FIS had agreed on the use of the drone at Tuesday's slalom but the pilot wasn't allowed to fly the camera directly over the race course.\n\n\"He did not follow our instructions,\" the race director said. \"He had to fly outside of the race track and follow the racer from a 15-meter (50-foot) distance. Then there would have been a margin and nothing could have happened.\"\n\nDrones have been used many times before at ski races. The ski federation said the new technology was aimed at enhancing the experience for TV viewers as it provides moving pictures from an overhead angle which regular cameras can't shoot.\n\nFIS said legal restrictions in Italy for the use of drones at events are not as tight as in many other countries, such as Austria and Switzerland, where flying over a crowd has been banned.\n\nHirscher reclaimed the overall World Cup lead from Aksel Lund Svindal, who no longer races slalom.\n\nThe Olympic bronze medalist, Kristoffersen earned his sixth World Cup victory. He also became the first man to win the opening two slaloms of the season since Austria's Reinfried Herbst six years ago.\n\n\"Madonna is a real classic. So many greats have won here -- [Alberto] Tomba, [Ingemar] Stenmark,\" Kristoffersen said. \"To be here as a winner is unbelievable.\"\n\nAustria's Marco Schwarz, who started with the No. 33 bib, finished third, 1.59 seconds behind, for his first podium in only his third World Cup race.\n\nLast year's winner, Felix Neureuther, missed a gate in his second run and failed to finish.\n\nKristoffersen showed a rapid rhythm, and his strength enabled him to maintain his balance even on a few tricky gates that were spaced differently from the others.\n\n\"The snow is really good,\" Kristoffersen said. \"It was really fun to ski it.\"\n\nAfter a holiday break, the men's circuit resumes with a downhill in Santa Caterina Valfurva on Tuesday.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "No (dinosaur) bones about it: William Hayes remains key cog for Rams": "EARTH CITY, Mo. -- Defensive ends William Hayes and Chris Long became fast friends in 2012, when Hayes signed with the St. Louis Rams.\n\nHayes and Long shared a love of jokes, both practical and verbal; hard work on the practice field and in the film and weight rooms; and an intense desire to win on game days. It's a friendship that has had few obstacles, with one notable exception.\n\nAlthough it can often be hard to tell if Hayes is serious or joking, he vehemently protests that dinosaurs ever walked the earth.\n\n\"He thinks archaeologists place bones underground like a parent would place Easter eggs,\" Long said earlier this season, laughing. \"They just planted them. It's some large conspiracy. He does not believe that dinosaurs ever existed and he thinks that mermaids are real. I love dinosaurs, so we have a big point of contention.\"\n\nIt's true. Whether or not it started out as a joke and grew into a conviction is irrelevant at this point. Ask Hayes about the existence of dinosaurs and mermaids and you'll get the type of mythological hot takes you're only likely to find on the furthest reaches of social media and the Internet.\n\n\"No, I don't believe dinosaurs existed,\" Hayes said last month. \"Not even a little bit. With these bones, it's crazy because man has never seen a dinosaur, we can agree on that, right? But we know exactly how to put these bones together? I believe there is more of a chance you will find a mermaid than you will a dinosaur because we find different species in the water all the time.\n\n\"I don't understand how [Long] just believes in dinosaurs. That's just crazy to me. We know they died. We know what a T-Rex eats? That don't sound crazy to you? We have never seen a dinosaur before but we know exactly where every single rib [was] and which rib goes where. That's crazy to me.\"\n\nSomething that isn't so crazy? Acknowledging that Hayes doubles as one of the NFL's most underrated defensive linemen and genuine characters. In a league filled with clich\u00e9d answers, Hayes offers real, unfiltered thoughts on any topic thrown his way. He's the Rams' version of the most interesting man in the world. But beneath the theories and pranks, Hayes is pretty darn good at football and an invaluable piece of the Rams defensive line.\n\nOne need look no further than Sunday's 23-17 win against the Seattle Seahawks to see how Hayes can alter a game. He finished with nine tackles, three sacks, four tackles for loss and five quarterback hits in leading the Rams to their first win in Seattle since Jan. 8, 2005.\n\nThe numbers were impressive but they don't do much for Hayes, who says he prefers to evaluate his play on how well he handles his responsibilities rather than sack totals.\n\n\"I don't really put a lot of effort into, 'Oh, I have got to get these sacks,'\" he has said. \"My whole thing is I just want to play solid. When it's all said and done, I just want to be able to say at the end of the year I played good football.\"\n\nMore often than not, that has been the case in Hayes' nearly four seasons with the Rams. By his own admission, Hayes' propensity for laughing and joking held him back during his first four seasons in the league with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nWhen he signed with the Rams after they hired Jeff Fisher, the coach who drafted him in Tennessee, Hayes made it a point to understand there's a time and a place for the laughs and a time and a place when things have to be serious.\n\nFor Hayes, the transformation on game days is no laughing matter.\n\n\"When Sunday rolls around, it's just all about football,\" said Hayes, who was so upset by a loss to his former team in 2013 that he cut his arm when he smashed a locker-room mirror. \"For me, nothing else is really funny. Even when we are out there at practice in our team periods, I'm in serious mode. But once the offense gets it going, I can sit down and joke around with the guys.\n\n\"You have got to know at the end of the day, there's a time and place for play. That's what I had to learn. It took me a long time, until I got to St. Louis, to learn that. My first three or four years in the NFL, I can honestly say it was too much play and I was never serious.\"\n\nHayes has posted 153 tackles, 21.5 sacks, three forced fumbles, four fumble recoveries and an interception in almost four full seasons with the Rams. Most of that production has come on limited snaps as Hayes has primarily served as the top backup to Long, though Long's injuries have thrust Hayes into a starting job regularly over the past two seasons.\n\n\"He's super important and people don't give him enough credit -- people kind of think he's dopey at times,\" defensive coordinator Gregg Williams said. \"All the goofy things he does and he's always got a smile on his face. He's constantly keeping things stirred up. You guys see him go down and put his head down on the goal post because he's getting ready to go to a dark place when the game [starts].\"\n\nHayes also considers it part of his job to keep Williams on his toes. At Halloween, Hayes showed up to a meeting as what he called a \"superhero that believes in saving all mankind.\" Williams was a bit thrown off his game.\n\n\"He quickly has found the fastest way to get my fuse lit,\" Williams said at the time. \"Unless he gets that done every day, he doesn't think he's had a very good day.\"\n\nHayes' ability to scheme and execute pranks with Long has become legendary in the Rams' locker room. There was the time he and Long \"allegedly\" filled linebacker James Laurinaitis' car with 10,000 crickets, a joke so over the top that Laurinaitis had to get rid of the car because many of the crickets died in the vents. Or the times when Hayes and his cohorts hired trailers to pick up teammates' cars and store them on the practice field. Or the time when they moved two cars across the street from the training facility and had makeshift houses built around them.\n\n\"I think when it comes to the pranks they do, his mind just goes,\" defensive tackle Michael Brockers said. \"It keeps the mood light, it keeps it fun, it keeps guys wanting to come back.\"\n\nAfter the Rams play San Francisco on Sunday, Hayes will join the rest of his teammates and the organization in heading toward an offseason full of uncertainty. He'll be an unrestricted free agent at 30 with gas left in the tank. Although he has had his share of medical procedures in recent years, he still offers value to a team seeking help on the defensive line, especially if he can be kept fresh as part of a rotation.\n\nIt would be logical for the Rams to try to bring Hayes back and it would make sense that he'd want to stay, but he could also have his share of suitors. Whoever lands him will get a player who can energize a team on and off the field.\n\n\"I try to tell everybody as much as I can about him because I think it would be a shame if the world didn't know,\" Long said.\n\nLong's message is an important one, for it would be a shame if characters like Hayes were to go extinct.", "Kyrie Irving's performance masks the Cleveland Cavaliers' mediocrity": "PHOENIX -- It was a great night for Kyrie Irving on Monday. It was only a so-so night for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nIrving scored the Cavs\u2019 final seven points in the last three minutes -- finishing out a game for the first time out of the four he has played since making his comeback from surgery to repair a fractured left kneecap -- to help Cleveland to a 101-97 win over the Phoenix Suns.\n\nHaving Irving reach that level again -- he finished with 22 points in 24 minutes -- was a sight for sore eyes. He punctuated the performance with a 3-pointer with 21 seconds left that iced the game, letting it fly with two-tenths of a second on the shot clock to put the Cavs up by four.\n\n\u201cGreat feeling having the kid back, you know,\u201d LeBron James said of Irving. \u201cHe does so much for our team, creates another threat on our floor, and obviously a big shot he made.\u201d\n\nYet some of the cheeriness that could\u2019ve surrounded Irving\u2019s night was couched by Cleveland\u2019s overall showing as a team.\n\nKyrie Irving looked the best he has since returning from injury, but the Cavs struggled as a unit on Monday. Ross D. Franklin/AP\n\nThe Cavs gave up 30 first-quarter points to a Suns squad in complete disarray that has one star player, Markieff Morris, suspended for throwing a towel at the head coach; another star player, Eric Bledsoe, about to go under the knife for meniscus surgery this week, and a coaching staff that was cut down and reshuffled over the weekend after Phoenix\u2019s owner and general manager met with every player on the roster for their input.\n\nFurthermore, Irving\u2019s heroics came in the midst of the Cavs' eight-point lead with 4 minutes, 36 seconds remaining in the fourth being cut all the way down to one with 1:28 to go against a Phoenix team that came into the night 5-15 in its past 20 games.\n\n\u201cI think we had some good moments, we had some bad moments,\u201d James admitted.\n\nOn the good side, Cavs coach David Blatt\u2019s decision to put Tristan Thompson in the starting lineup in place of Timofey Mozgov paid off in the sense that Cleveland won to snap its two-game skid and Thompson was reasonably effective (five points and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes) in his expanded role.\n\n\u201cPotentially for a while,\u201d Blatt said when asked how permanent the lineup swap will be. \u201cI don\u2019t see it happening forever. But potentially.\u201d\n\nAlso in the plus column was the fact that Cleveland made strides on offense, shooting better from 3-point territory (17-for-41 for 41.5 percent) that it had from the floor overall in any of its past three games, when it shot sub-40 percent against New York, Golden State and Portland.\n\nBut in adding up the bad stuff, not only was it a far-from-dominant effort against a downtrodden opponent, but Cleveland simply is not in sync the way most teams with championship aspirations would want to be nearly 30 games into the season.\n\nIt was a less-than inspiring night from James, as he finished with 14 points, seven assists, four rebounds, two steals and a block. His numbers weren\u2019t as troubling as his body language, which vacillated between disinterested and upset for most of the night -- getting into a couple of brief back-and-forth spats with teammates over failed defensive execution.\n\nThe game also saw pretty much a completely new rotation out of Blatt, who not only started Thompson, but played 10 players anywhere from 13 to 35 minutes. While it gave those players a chance to do something in the time allotted, it also meant that Mo Williams, Anderson Varejao and Jared Cunningham were cut out of the rotation completely, all receiving DNP-CDs.\n\n\u201cI thought we were pretty generous with the minutes that we gave those 10 guys and I thought we got a return on them,\u201d Blatt said.\n\nThat return was a win, but also a disjointed night. Even Irving\u2019s big 3 was sullied ever so slightly by the fact that he nearly threw the ball out of bounds at the beginning of the possession. J.R. Smith made a great play on the ball to save it and pass it out to Kevin Love, who then tossed it over to Irving for the shot.\n\nYet, maybe it was just one of those survive-and-advance type of nights that come up on the NBA schedule. There was no profound breakthrough or letdown, just an incremental accomplishment for a star on the mend and a continuation of the process the Cavs have been through for months to try to recapture that magic cohesiveness that carried them through the second half of last season.\n\n\u201cGuys, we won the game,\u201d veteran James Jones quipped to a couple of reporters before exiting the locker room for the night. \u201cThat should be the only thing that matters.\u201d", "After rough rehabs, Mavs' investment in wing pair starting to pay off": "DALLAS -- The Dallas Mavericks managed to keep their heads well above water while the two highest-paid players on the roster struggled in their returns from major surgeries.\n\nThe reality, however, is that the Mavs will be nothing more than first-round fodder if they don't get good returns on their big investments, Wesley Matthews and Chandler Parsons.\n\nMatthews and Parsons embrace that pressure. This is a pair that confidently declared that they'd rank among the NBA's elite wing duos -- and said so this summer, well before either had even been cleared for basketball activity.\n\nThe process wasn't pretty for the first third of the season, but there are plenty of signs of a potential payoff as the calendar flips to 2016.\n\nWesley Matthews scored a game-high 22 points for the Mavericks on Monday. Glenn James/NBAE via Getty Images\n\n\"I think it's more exciting that we're not anywhere close to what we can be as a tandem, as a duo, but I think we have flashes of it,\" Matthews said after scoring a game-high 22 points in Monday's 103-93 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. \"We're nowhere near it, but we're on that path, and it's going to be scary when it happens.\"\n\nMatthews and Parsons -- who are coming back from a ruptured Achilles tendon and hybrid microfracture knee surgery, respectively, surgeries that could be considered career-threatening -- have both made tremendous progress this month after tough Novembers.\n\nThe minutes restrictions are no more. While they must continue to diligently rehab on a daily basis, they both feel close to completely healthy. And there have been significant upticks in their performances recently.\n\n\"It's been a long time coming, and we're finally starting to feel to ourselves and getting to where we should be,\" said Parsons, who had 13 points, four rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block against the Bucks.\n\nMatthews, who stunned many by fulfilling his vow to be ready for the season opener less than eight months after being injured, has followed up a horrendous shooting month by averaging 15.2 points per game and knocking down 41.2 percent of his 3-point attempts in December. That kind of production was the norm during his five-year stint in Portland before the Mavs gave him a four-year, $70 million max contract this summer, believing his professionalism, perimeter shooting and defensive excellence would make him an upgrade from Monta Ellis, who led Dallas in scoring last season.\n\nParsons, who is in the second season of a three-year, $46 million deal, finally got rid of the minutes leash in the last week. He has responded with his best three-game stretch of the season, displaying his versatility by averaging 14.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.7 assists while shooting 55.9 percent from the floor during the Mavs' modest winning streak.\n\n\"Both of these guys stated very clearly when their injuries happened that their goal was not only to be back, but to be back better than before,\" coach Rick Carlisle said. \"To do that, it's going to be a long-term proposition. They're both doing well. And they'll do better and better and better as the season goes along.\"\n\nThe Mavs' big-money players also firmly believe the chemistry between them will get better and better as the season goes.\n\nMatthews and Parsons formed a friendship during the free-agency process, hanging out and working out together in Los Angeles while Parsons pitched Matthews and DeAndre Jordan on coming to Dallas. That bond grew stronger after Matthews stuck to his commitment -- Jordan backed out of his -- and the wings went through much of their rehab process together.\n\nHowever, as Matthews noted Monday night, the pair missed out on four months of valuable floor time together. With wing partner Nicolas Batum in Portland, Matthews developed the kind of on-court chemistry that required minimal communication to know how each other would read and react to situations. That's a work in progress with Parsons.\n\nNevertheless, the wings consider themselves perfect fits for each other, a shooter spacing the floor for a playmaker, a cutter working off a post-up threat. And they're starting to provide proof with their production.\n\n\"We're getting there, but we have high expectations for ourselves,\" Parsons said. \"We plan to fulfill all of them. I think we can be one of the best duos in the league on the wing.\"\n\nThe Mavs are banking on it.", "Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones doesn't plan on major changes heading into 2016": "ESPN Cowboys reporter Todd Archer agrees with owner Jerry Jones' assessment that the team will be better if healthy next year. (2:41)\n\nAt 4-11, the Dallas Cowboys are one of the NFL's most disappointing teams this season. But owner and general manager Jerry Jones on Tuesday said he doesn't plan on any major changes among coaches or players going into 2016.\n\n\"The bottom line is that I can make you a strong case where you should line them up and go again with your hand,\" Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas. \"But under any circumstances, you have to do what you have to do.\n\n\"And so just change for change sake? No, you're not going to have that because I believe that we're closer than this record indicates.\"\n\nJerry Jones thinks the Cowboys are closer than their 4-11 record indicates. \"I say that because when it gets off-balance, when it gets out of kilter, it really goes off the road,\" Jones said. Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY Sports\n\nJones still expects offseason adjustments via the draft and free agency and possible tweaks to the coaching staff -- but nothing different from the norm.\n\n\"We're in relatively good shape under the salary cap, and we ought to look at that and change things,\" Jones said. \"Now don't say that that's the highlight of the day -- 'Things are changing' -- because they were going to change anyway. There's at least 20 percent of this roster that changes every year and maybe higher, and so there were going to be those kinds of changes. There's changes on coaching staffs that happen.\"\n\nJones didn't want to pin the Cowboys' woes on injuries to quarterback Tony Romo, who twice suffered a broken left collarbone this season. The Cowboys are 1-10 this season in games started by backups Brandon Weeden, Matt Cassel and Kellen Moore.\n\nJones said he did not have an answer as to why Weeden, who threw two touchdown passes and ran for another in his first start for the Texans, could succeed in Houston after going 0-3 with the Cowboys.\n\n\"We should have coached them up enough, done enough things that some of these games that we lost on our way to this record we could have won. You see other teams doing it and then you see another team doing it with a quarterback that left here that couldn't do it.\"\n\nThe Cowboys are not the only team that entered the season with high expectations that has fallen short this year. The Baltimore Ravens and San Diego Chargers are other examples.\n\nGoing into the 2014 season, Jones said the Cowboys faced an \"uphill battle,\" and the team finished 12-4. Coming out of training camp this summer, Jones thought he had a better team in 2015.\n\n\"I think we're closer, and I say that because when it gets off-balance, when it gets out of kilter, it really goes off the road,\" Jones said. \"And if you look you can see that in a lot of places. ... You realize what a fine line it is when you really got it all humming.\"\n\nJones said he thinks he has a team with enough pieces to compete in 2016, provided Romo stays healthy and has an improved backup if called upon.\n\n\"I think the thing that motivates me to address it, both short and long term, [is] Romo's relatively short -- three to five [years left] -- and then long term with a prospect that might be a future, is the fact that we're close,\" Jones said. \"You can operate in pretty good in this territory.\"", "Julio Jones spectacular as Atlanta Falcons deliver Panthers first loss": "Carolina could only muster 268 total yards of offense as they fall to the Falcons 20-13 in Atlanta. (1:17)\n\nATLANTA -- Anything is possible when you have Julio Jones.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons' Pro Bowl wide receiver showed Sunday why he is probably the most dangerous deep threat in the NFL. In the third quarter against the previously undefeated Carolina Panthers, Jones catapulted himself in the air to catch a ball quarterback Matt Ryan sailed 52 yards in the air. Jones extended both arms to snatch it over the top of Carolina linebacker Luke Kuechly, kept his balance and proceeded to sprint the final 18 yards for the touchdown.\n\nIt was the play that gave the Falcons energy and momentum to pull off an improbable 20-13 win over the Panthers at the Georgia Dome. It got the bitter taste of a 38-0 defeat at the hands of the same Panthers two weeks ago out of the Falcons' mouths.\n\nJones finished with nine catches for 178 yards and his touchdown. He surpassed his own team season record of 1,593 receiving yards -- he now has 1,722 yards on 127 receptions.\n\nJulio Jones' record-setting day also included a 70-yard touchdown play that boosted the Falcons over the previously undefeated Panthers. Jason Getz/USA TODAY Sports\n\nWhat were they thinking? The bad exchange between Matt Ryan and center Mike Person with the Falcons driving in the fourth quarter almost killed the momentum. The ball was recovered by Panthers cornerback Josh Norman. Bad exchanges have been a hot topic for the Falcons throughout the season. Yes, it was a bad snap by Person, but Ryan probably should have still controlled this one.\n\nOne reason to get excited: Rookie Vic Beasley has taken his share of criticism and recently revealed that he has been playing with a torn labrum. But the first-round draft pick showed his promise by forcing a Cam Newton fumble in the final minute, recovered by Adrian Clayborn to seal the win. Beasley brought pressure throughout the day in what was his best showing of the season, even without a sack.\n\nOne reason to panic: This goes back to the center-quarterback exchange. The Falcons have to get that resolved now so it's not a lingering problem moving forward. If that means Person won't be the center next season and beyond, so be it. James Stone wasn't the answer, either, and Gino Gradkowski never got a shot.\n\nFantasy watch: Jones and Freeman bought home fantasy points with their respective touchdowns. Freeman scored his 11th rushing touchdown of the season (13th total), and Jones had his eighth touchdown reception of the season.\n\nOuch: Special teams ace Eric Weems left the game with a concussion while nose tackle Paul Soliai was shelved by a nagging calf injury that flared up twice.

Not a bad way to go out.\n\nDos Anjos and \"Cowboy'\" Cerrone first met in August 2013, with the defending champion coming away with a unanimous-decision win. Since then, the two have combined for a 12-1 record. Dos Anjos is 4-1 since their first encounter, while Cerrone has rattled off eight in a row. ESPN is here to break down the main event as well as provide picks for the rest of the main card. Don't agree with my predictions? Let me know (nicely, of course) on Twitter: @bokamotoESPN.\n\nMain event\n\nRafael dos Anjos (24-7) vs. Donald Cerrone (28-6)\n\nLightweight championship\n\nOdds: Dos Anjos minus-220; Cerrone plus-180\n\nSpeaking in generalities, Cerrone has historically struggled with two things: slow starts and southpaws. In that 2013 matchup against dos Anjos, both came into play.\n\nUFC: Rafael dos Anjos-Donald Cerrone Where: Amway Center, Orlando, Florida\n\nWhen: Saturday\n\nTV: FOX, 8 p.m. ET\n\nCerrone was out-struck in the opening round 28 to 11, which might not sound so bad if it weren't for the fact that all 28 of dos Anjos' strikes felt hard. Dos Anjos dropped Cerrone with a right hook and removed some of the life from his offense with kicks to the body and head. Cerrone looked tentative and had no early answer for dos Anjos, who easily moved into the boxing range he wished the fight to take place at. By the time Cerrone turned things around in the third, it was too late.\n\nThe answer to whether or not Cerrone has made real adjustments to his game will be answered on Saturday -- even more so than it has been answered during his eight-fight winning streak. He can't allow dos Anjos to set a boxing range like he did the first time they met. Cerrone is best either when he's making good use of his reach or able to secure a clinch and bust opponents with knees. At a boxing range, he doesn't have the hand speed to compete with dos Anjos, who is a vastly underrated athlete.\n\nThe good news for Cerrone is he seems to have put his southpaw woes in the rearview mirror. After losing twice to Ben Henderson, Diaz and dos Anjos (all southpaws), Cerrone has rattled off four consecutive wins against lefties. Just for his confidence alone, that's big going into a title fight. Against dos Anjos specifically, he'll want to avoid the right hook that dropped him in their previous fight. Cerrone tends to drop his lead left hand during exchanges and dos Anjos took advantage of this over and over again with one of his best punches. Dos Anjos is solid at going to the body with hands and kicks, so eventually he forces opponents to drop their guard, but Cerrone has a bit of a tendency to do it anyway and it has hurt him in this matchup before.\n\nYou hear it every time Cerrone fights, either in pre-fight analysis or as the fight is playing out: \"Cowboy\" has good wrestling. He was 1-for-1 on takedown attempts the previous time he fought dos Anjos and it would probably be in his best interest to wrestle more in the rematch. Not that wrestling has to be his clear path to victory, but a few well-timed double legs might suppress dos Anjos' pressure some, which would be a great thing for Cerrone. The more dos Anjos pressures, successfully, the worse this fight is going to go for the challenger. Cerrone can lean on the jab to slow that pressure, as well as use his terrific knee strikes against a shorter opponent. Maybe he can lean on a takedown here and there as well.\n\nEditor's Picks Cerrone fighting for more than UFC title against dos Anjos Despite talk of a showdown with Conor McGregor if he's victorious, Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone is keeping his focus on UFC lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos entering Saturday's rematch.\n\nA single-faceted game plan probably isn't going to beat dos Anjos. The Kings MMA lightweight was the best-kept secret of the division for a long time but that secret is out now. RDA is strong, quick and well-rounded. He's a top pound-for-pound candidate. Cerrone should be more prepared for his physical gifts having seen them before, but outside of landing a flash knockout, I believe this fight will feature a little bit of everything if Cerrone gets the win.\n\nA very good wrestler himself, dos Anjos figures to score takedowns and he'll be confident from the top. Cerrone has an abundance of finishes off his back, but dos Anjos is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt on the ground and he'll dominate the scorecards if he's landing punches from the top while Cerrone throws up triangle chokes. Just as I believe offensive wrestling could play a major role in an upset for Cerrone, it could play an equally large role in dos Anjos' first title defense.\n\nPrediction: Dos Anjos by decision.\n\nRest of the main card\n\nJunior dos Santos (17-3) vs. Alistair Overeem (39-14), heavyweights\n\nWhat effect will a change in camp have on JDS (who held training camp at American Top Team)? A good one, I believe.\n\nPrediction: Dos Santos by KO.\n\nNate Diaz (17-10) vs. Michael Johnson (16-9), lightweights\n\nDiaz attempts to return to form. Even if he's at his best, Johnson's speed, pressure and wrestling will be a tall order. I have a feeling, though.\n\nPrediction: Diaz by second-round submission.\n\nMyles Jury (15-1) vs. Charles Oliveira (20-5), featherweights\n\nThis marks the first go at 145 pounds for Jury. Stylistically, he might be set up to look good here.\n\nPrediction: Jury by TKO.", "Kobe Bryant of Los Angeles Lakers says he would advise rookie self 'to understand compassion and empathy'": "Kobe Bryant sits down with Michael Wilbon to discuss his upcoming retirement and the legacy he will leave in the NBA. (3:21)\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Lakers icon Kobe Bryant is nearing the end of a remarkable 20-season NBA career, but if he could go back in time and offer advice to himself as a rookie, what would he say?\n\n\"It's hard to tell somebody -- a player at that age -- to understand compassion and empathy, but that would be my advice,\" Bryant, 37, said after Sunday's 112-96 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies at FedEx Forum. \"It tends to come with time.\"\n\nBryant has had a notoriously contentious history with several teammates and coaches, and he has often been cited as a factor, if not the factor, for why some players leave the Lakers or why some free agents never join.\n\nKobe Bryant grasps leadership -- understanding how to identify with and encourage teammates -- much more at 37 in his 20th season than as a young and relentlessly demanding superstar, something he would advise his rookie self to correct. Gary A. Vasquez/USA TODAY Sports\n\nYet, of all the things Bryant could tell his younger self, why compassion and empathy?\n\n\"Well, because that's the biggest thing about being a leader, I think, and winning a championship is understanding how to put yourself in other people's shoes,\" he said. \"That's really the most important thing. It's not necessarily the individual skill you possess. It's about understanding others and what they may be going through.\n\n\"And then, in turn, when you understand that, you can communicate with them a little bit better and bring out the best in them. Bringing out the best in people isn't passing them the ball and giving them open shots. It's about how to connect with them, how to communicate with them so that they can navigate through whatever issues they may be facing. That's a very, very hard thing to do.\"\n\nBryant said he remembered the specific moment when he began to understand that concept. It came more than a decade ago, when forward Rick Fox was his Lakers teammate.\n\n\"It was in a meeting at Southwest College [in Los Angeles], and we were having a team meeting and Rick Fox said, 'Kobe, we just want to feel like you need us,'\" Bryant said.\n\n\"I was like, 'What the hell is this grown-ass man [saying]? What are you talking [about]?' But then, it kind of caught me, because it was a very vulnerable thing for him to say, and it helped me have perspective on what he may be going through and what he's feeling. And then, from that standpoint, it really changed my mentality and how I kind of looked at it, and I've been working on it ever since.\"", "History's biggest bouts during the festive period": "With this being the season of goodwill, boxing generally shuts down over the festive period with big fights in America and Britain about as rare as a sighting of Santa.\n\nBut that was not the case decades ago, when title fights and big names were involved in some season's beatings. In a few places there will still be boxing this Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Eve.\n\nLast Saturday's world title fight between Andy Lee and Billy Joe Saunders is about as close as it gets for a major title fight being staged in the UK before Christmas, and the hurt business then takes a break until the New Year.\n\nSimilarly in the United States, last Saturday's bill featuring world featherweight No.1 Nicholas Walters and the WBA interim heavyweight title bout between Luis Ortiz and Bryant Jennings was the last big boxing show in America until Deontay Wilder defends his WBC world heavyweight title back in New York on January 16. On the same night in London, former world heavyweight champion David Haye makes his comeback after over three years out in the first significant fight in the UK for nearly a month.\n\nHowever, there are professional boxing events taking place in Belgium and South Africa on Christmas Day and also on Boxing Day in Belgium, Argentina, Italy, Japan, Nigeria and Ghana.\n\nAnd on December 29 there are two world title fights on the same bill in Tokyo, Japan, as Naoya Inoue takes on Warlito Parrena for the WBO super-flyweight title and Javier Mendoza faces Akira Yaegashi for the IBF light-flyweight belt.\n\nTakashi Uchiyama, left, takes on Oliver Flores in Tokyo on New Year's Eve -- one of five title fights that night Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images\n\nJapan and Thailand have an appetite for enjoying fisticuffs around this time of year and on New Year's Eve Japan hosts no fewer than five world title fights at three different venues, the pick of which is Japan's WBA world super-featherweight champion Takashi Uchiyama (23-0-1, 19 KOs) against Oliver Flores (27-1-2, 17 KOs), from Nicaragua. It will be the fifth year in succession that Uchiyama has defended his world title on New Year's Eve. He clearly enjoys it, after reigning for five years and is currently No.1 in the ESPN world divisional rankings at super-featherweight.\n\nThe other world title fights on a busy New Year's Eve for Japanese boxing are at flyweight, light-flyweight and minimum-weight but boxing over the festive period was once common in different parts of the world.\n\nPerhaps the biggest fight over the festive period happened when Jack Johnson became boxing's first black world heavyweight champion on Boxing Day in 1908. Johnson, from Texas, toyed with Tommy Burns before forcing a seventh round stoppage in Sydney to start his seven-year reign. In the 14th round the police stormed into the ring to stop the one-sided fight after Burns had been dumped on the canvas. Canadian Burns felt so humiliated he stayed in Australia for 14 months.\n\nA few years later, on Christmas Day 1923, Harry Greb was supposed to defend his world middleweight title against Tommy Loughran, but Loughran had got stuck into the Christmas turkey a little early and missed the weight by more than eight pounds, making it a non-title bout. Greb won by a 10-round decision and would only see another two Christmas Days while Loughran went on to become world light-heavyweight champion.\n\nIt was a sad Christmas Day for Kid Chocolate in 1933.

Two months later, Robinson beat Jake LaMotta for the world middleweight title in their famous fight that became known as the St Valentine's Day Massacre.\n\nLaMotta, known as the Raging Bull, was in action a couple years later on New Year's Eve in 1952 when he was sent to the canvas for the first time in 103 fights by a right hand from Danny Nardico. LaMotta was being beaten so badly that his corner pulled him out at the end of the seventh round in Florida. Former world middleweight champion LaMotta went off to see in the New Year and ponder his career, which was to have just three more fights left.\n\nKid Herman was left with a banging headache on New Year's Day 1907 after being knocked out by a ferocious right hook thrown by Joe Gans. The first African-American world champion at any weight division defended his world lightweight title with the eighth round KO win in the afternoon at the Big Casino in Tonopah, Nevada.

There are five relievers in the Hall of Fame:\n\nHoyt Wilhelm: The first great longtime reliever, Wilhelm finished with 228 saves and a 2.52 ERA. That save total pales in comparison with Hoffman's 601, but Wilhelm pitched in a different era. Wilhelm won 143 games compared with Hoffman's 61 and pitched 1,100 more innings, with a lower ERA.\n\nRollie Fingers: The mustachioed one went 114-118 with a 2.90 ERA and 341 saves. He topped 100 innings nine times as a reliever. Hoffman's career high was 90 innings, and he topped 80 just three times. Fingers pitched 700 more innings than Hoffman, essentially the equivalent of 10 additional 70-inning seasons that modern closers now throw. Fingers was also the key reliever on three World Series winners with the Oakland A's, including the 1973 World Series, in which he pitched 13\u2154 innings.\n\nGoose Gossage: He came on the scene a few years after Fingers and lasted forever but is from the same generation. He went 124-107 with a 3.01 ERA, 310 saves and 800 more innings than Hoffman. While Fingers was elected on the second ballot, it took Gossage nine years to get in.\n\nBruce Sutter: He had a dominant stretch, leading the league in saves five times in six years, but he had a short career, finishing with 300 career saves and 40 fewer innings than Hoffman. Sutter was one of the first relievers to be used primarily with a lead, but he still topped 100 innings five times. A bit of an odd selection by the BBWAA, given the length of his career, he might have received extra credit for popularizing the split-fingered fastball.\n\nDennis Eckersley: He spent the first part of his career as a good starter but made the Hall of Fame based on his 390 career saves and five-year stretch from 1988 to 1992 when he went 24-7 with a 1.91 ERA and 220 saves.\n\nMy point here: None of these guys are really comparable to Hoffman. The first four pitched when closers were used differently, so we can't really compare save totals, and Eckersley was a hybrid starter/reliever. In terms of career WAR, they rank like this:\n\nEckersley: 62.5\n\nWilhelm: 50.1\n\nGossage: 41.8\n\nHoffman: 28.0\n\nFingers: 25.0\n\nSutter: 24.5\n\nFor Hoffman supporters, this makes the case pretty simple: He's second to Mariano Rivera on the all-time saves list, pitched a long time, and even had more career value than Fingers or Sutter.\n\nThen there's this take from Joe Sheehan, via his highly recommended newsletter subscription:\n\nIn thinking about Hoffman and the Hall of Fame, I keep coming back to Andy Benes. He may have disappointed Padres fans by being a league-average starter rather than a superstar one, but he was an All-Star and he picked up award votes a handful of times. When he hit free agency, which he did twice, he was paid the going rate for top-tier starting pitchers. At no point during his career did anyone suggest that Benes should stop throwing 200 innings a year and start throwing 70.\n\nIf they had, would he be on a ballot today?\n\nBenes is why I can't get behind the idea of Trevor Hoffman for the Hall of Fame. I don't know for sure that Benes could have done what Hoffman did, but I know that many pitchers have done so. I am certain that Hoffman could not do what Benes did, and I'm just as certain that what Benes did, be a good starting pitcher for a decade, was more valuable than what Hoffman did, which is to be a short reliever and then a one-inning reliever for 15 years.\n\nI happen to agree with Sheehan. Most voters appear to disagree with us. Ryan Thibs keeps track of public Hall of Fame ballots. Through 91 voters, Hoffman is sitting at 63 percent. This indicates he won't get in this year, but that's a strong starting position, and he'll get next year or the year after. Meanwhile, Curt Schilling is at 57 percent, Mike Mussina at 53 percent and Edgar Martinez at 53 percent. Martinez, seemingly hurt by being a DH for most of his career, is being outpolled by an even more extreme specialist.\n\nThe rationale, I guess, is this: Closer is a position, and Hoffman was clearly one of the best. In looking at Win Probability Added, which gives more weight to usage patterns, Hoffman does rank second among relievers:\n\n1. Mariano Rivera, 56.6\n\n2. Hoffman, 34.1\n\n3. Gossage, 32.5\n\n4. Wilhelm, 31.1\n\n5. Joe Nathan, 31.0\n\n6. Jonathan Papelbon, 29.5\n\n7. Billy Wagner, 29.0\n\nClosers aren't being compared to players at other positions, but only to the small subset of other closers. That's the Hoffman Hall of Fame argument, not whether he was actually more valuable than Martinez or Mussina or Schilling, which he wasn't. No GM would ever have traded any of those three for Hoffman.\n\nSo Hoffman is getting a lot of Hall of Fame support while deserving starting pitchers such as Schilling and Mussina are struggling to get 50 percent of the vote after years on the ballot. And don't forget that Schilling was one of the best postseason pitchers ever. While the other five Hall of Fame closers all pitched for World Series champs, Hoffman gakked up his lunch in arguably the five biggest games of his career:\n\n1996 NLDS Game 3: With the score tied in the ninth, he gave up a two-run homer to Brian Jordan, and the Cards won the series.\n\n1998 NLCS Game 1: Hoffman blew a 2-1 lead in the ninth but got the win when the Padres scored in the 10th.\n\n1998 World Series Game 3: With the Padres up 3-2 in the eighth, he gave up a three-run homer to Scott Brosius. The Yankees won the game to take a 3-0 series lead.\n\n2007 regular season Game 161: In a game the Padres needed to win to clinch a playoff spot, Hoffman blew the lead in the ninth, and the Padres lost in 11.\n\n2007 tiebreaker game: The Padres scored twice in the top of the 13th against the Rockies, but Hoffman allowed three runs in the bottom half.\n\nHoffman was a great closer. But he wasn't a greater player than Edgar Martinez or Larry Walker or Alan Trammell or Schilling or Mussina. I don't have a Hall of Fame vote (yet), but Hoffman wouldn't make my ballot of 10.", "Seamus Donahue honoring fallen father at Marine Corps Marathon": "Sherri Donahue has plenty of photos of her husband, Michael, running with their son, Seamus. But one is special.\n\nMichael and Seamus are crossing the finish line of a race together, stride for stride. Each is stopping his watch at the same moment, with the same expression. Neither is noticing the other is a mirror image.\n\n\"They were in sync,\" she says.\n\nIt was that kind of relationship. They shared the same sense of humor and a passion for running. When Michael, a major with the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, was home, the two were training partners. They pushed each other, made fun of each other, laughed and entered countless races, from 5Ks to 10-milers.\n\n\"He was my best friend, my running buddy. I loved it,\" says Seamus, 18. \"We did everything together.\"\n\nMichael was a fountain of positive energy who adored his three children. He liked to say, \"Every day is a good day.\"\n\n\"Michael prioritized his children, all of his children,\" says Sherri. \"He wanted each and every one of them to know every day they were loved.\"\n\nBut on Sept. 16, 2014, Seamus and his sisters Victoria and Bailey lost their dad. Maj. Michael Donahue, just 41, was killed when a Taliban suicide bomber attacked his convoy in Afghanistan. For a while, Seamus couldn't run. It was the last thing on his mind.\n\nEditor's Picks Williams: Army widow runs for a cause Army widow Lisa Hallett used running to cope after the death of her husband, Capt. John Hallett, and now her Ironman journey and Wear Blue foundation are inspiring other military families as they deal with loss, writes Doug Williams\n\nBut after three weeks he participated in a slow two-mile jog-and-talk with a good friend around his Sanford, North Carolina, neighborhood. It made him feel better. Soon, Seamus was back running cross country for his high school team. Now the college freshman says he feels a connection with his dad every time he puts on his running shoes and heads out onto a trail or road.\n\nThis Sunday, Seamus will make his 26.2-mile debut in the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, D.C., in memory of his father. He'll be part of a group of runners wearing the bright blue shirts of the wear blue: run to remember organization that honors fallen military members. From Miles 12-13, he'll run past volunteers holding American flags and hundreds of photos of men and women killed in Afghanistan and Iraq. One of those photos will be of Michael.\n\nThen, when the race is over and he catches his breath, Seamus will make the walk from the finish line at the Marine Corps War Memorial at the edge of Arlington National Cemetery, to Section 60 to visit his dad. He's been there so often he says he could find his father's grave while blindfolded.\n\nAs race day approaches, he's eager to run for his father and for all the others who've been killed. But he's a bit apprehensive, too.\n\n\"I know I'm probably going to cry,\" says Seamus. \"It's moving ... I think it's going to be the most inspiring thing I'm ever going to do.\"\n\nA shared passion\n\nThe two became running buddies when Seamus was in the sixth grade. Michael, inspired by his friends to try road racing, entered a 5K with his son.\n\n\"I literally cried in pain my first mile,\" recalls Seamus.\n\nSeamus Donahue says the family's final vacation together was \"the best two weeks\" of his life. Courtesy of Seamus Donahue\n\nBut they completed the race and entered another. Soon, running was their thing. Over the years, they ran 10-milers together at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where Michael was stationed, and the annual Army Ten-Miler in Washington, D.C.\n\nBy high school, Seamus was running cross country and track, and also swimming. He liked the distance races best in track: 1,600 and 3,200 meters (mile and 2-mile). His father, too, enjoyed the longer runs, eventually running ultra marathons. Seamus says his dad's fascination with races up to 100 miles \"was insane.\"\n\nWhen they ran together, Michael would usually stay with his son. He was a strong, 6-foot-5 paratrooper with endurance to burn, but for him it wasn't about streaking ahead. He'd take off occasionally, but mostly he wanted to be with Seamus.\n\n\"My husband would not leave him behind on races,\" says Sherri.\n\nThe last time they would run together was in late July and August of 2014, when Michael came home for two weeks of R&R.\n\nHe and Sherri took Seamus and his two sisters on a road trip along the East Coast, from North Carolina through Virginia and Maryland to New York and Massachusetts, where Michael was raised. It was sightseeing and barbecues and family reunions and father-son runs. In a Facebook post -- a selfie with his family upon arrival from Afghanistan -- Michael wrote, \"Back with the band.\"\n\n\"It was the best two weeks of my life, to be honest,\" says Seamus.\n\nBefore hitting the road, Michael helped Seamus complete his project for Eagle Scout. Every moment Michael could be with his family, he was. Sherri says she and her husband were starting to talk, too, about him submitting his retirement papers.\n\n\"We just dropped all our stuff and traveled,\" says Seamus. \"I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nAlong the way, the family stopped at Arlington National Cemetery to visit the grave of Michael's cousin, John Kilkus, a Marine sergeant who was killed in the Middle East in 1990 during the lead-up to the first Gulf War. They also visited the graves of several of Michael's friends in Section 60.\n\n\"Literally six weeks -- six weeks -- after being there with him, we were there burying him,\" says Sherri. \"So, yeah, Arlington has a connection with our family and always will.\"\n\nHonoring his father\n\nToday, Seamus' profile photo on his Facebook page is of him and his dad from that last road trip. The two are smiling, their arms around each other's shoulders. Seamus' bright, red hair -- \"I'm just the random redhead in the family,\" he jokes -- and Michael's youthful features stand out.\n\nWeeks after the trip, when Seamus learned his father had been killed, he was stunned. His friend Matthew Calvelo, who often ran with Seamus and Michael, was the first person he called.\n\n\"We probably walked five or six miles around his neighborhood (that day),\" says Calvelo. \"Just over and over again, talking about his dad. Afterward he pulled out all the letters his dad sent to him over the years, over all his childhood pretty much, and read them all out loud. It was pretty emotional. Seamus was hit really hard.\"\n\nSeamus Donahue took his father's place in this year's Harbison 50K, and beat Michael's best time by two minutes. Courtesy of Seamus Donahue\n\nYet in many ways, Michael is still by his son's side. In the year-plus since his death, he's continued to lead his son into new running adventures.\n\nWhile he was overseas, Michael signed up for the Harbison 50K in Columbia, South Carolina, scheduled for January of this year. A couple of months before the race, Seamus says he received a Facebook message from David Nance, the race director and his father's good friend.\n\n\"He was like, 'Hey, would you take his spot?'\" Seamus recalls. He jumped at the chance. He admits now he \"never really mentally accepted the fact it was 31 miles. I just wanted to fill in my dad's steps and run that race.\"\n\nIt rained that day, and the hilly course was rugged. He calls it \"a beast.\" But Seamus finished in 5 hours, 58 minutes, beating his father's time from the previous year by about two minutes.\n\nThe race opened his eyes to ultras, and now he says he can see they might be his future, just as they were his father's favorites.\n\nOn July 4, Seamus also ran a 10K in Augusta, Georgia, near where his father had once served at Fort Gordon and been active in the running community. The Augusta Striders running club raised nearly $7,000 to erect a bronze memorial to Michael along the route.\n\nAnd now, Seamus -- at 6-2, who has grown into a long strider -- will run the Marine Corps Marathon, a race with deep military connections. It's organized by the Marine Corps and finishers receive their medals from a Marine. In 2014, both the men's and women's winners were active-duty Army soldiers.\n\nWhen Seamus was contacted by wear blue: run to remember to participate in this year's race and run his first marathon, he eagerly accepted.\n\n\"You can't beat it,\" he says. \"Big city, military support, support through running. Two things I love are the military and running, and those combined is just a wonderful thing.\"\n\nHe's not making any predictions about what time he might post. He's never run a marathon, is unfamiliar with the course and likely will stop between Miles 12-13 to honor his father in some way.\n\n\"I never want to put in a number,\" Seamus says. \"I just put on my shoes and finish. When I come across is what I get.\"\n\nSeamus says he'd love to have a time good enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon (3:05 for his age group). That accomplishment would connect him in another way to his dad, a lifelong New England sports fan who ran the Boston Marathon-concurrent \"Shadow Run\" in Afghanistan in 2014.\n\nBut that's secondary to the main purpose of this weekend's run: to honor his father and others.\n\n\"I run to remember,\" he says. \"I've met a lot of people in the past who have lost family members. I don't want to be selfish and do just my dad. I just want to be a good image to those who have fallen.\"\n\nOne of those who have fallen is the son of a woman he met recently. Her son was killed last year on the day of the marathon. After they had talked awhile and she learned he would be running this year's race, she asked Seamus to take some of her son's ashes with him during the race. He agreed.\n\n\"She said, 'When you're at the marathon ... wherever you are, just put him where your heart places him,'\" Seamus says. He's proud to do it.\n\nOne thing is certain: This won't be Seamus' last marathon. Running will always be part of his life, thanks to his dad. It's a link so strong he has trouble explaining it.\n\nAfter Michael was killed and Seamus returned to the cross country team, he had a breakthrough. He'd been stuck right around 18:00 flat in the 5K, but quickly dropped to 17:20.\n\n\"I dropped like 40 seconds in three weeks,\" he says. \"I just felt, honestly felt, like my dad was literally in me, moving my legs instead of me. It's really weird. I felt like it was actually happening.\"", "Nate Diaz: Circumstances with UFC are better": "One year ago, Nate Diaz limped out of the UFC Octagon in Phoenix, barely able to put weight on his right leg following a crippling loss to Rafael dos Anjos.\n\nThe loss brought a merciful end to one of the worst weeks in Diaz's fighting career. He missed weight by nearly five pounds and forfeited 20 percent of his purse. The UFC also fined Diaz an additional $10,000 for undisclosed reasons.\n\nIt was Diaz's only appearance of 2014, as he held out most of the year in an effort to force the UFC to renegotiate his contract. Behind the scenes, Diaz (17-10) was nursing a rib injury. In an interview with ESPN.com that week, the Stockton, California native stated, \"I don't know what I'm doing here.\"\n\nDiaz, 30, returns to the cage for the first time since that loss when he faces fellow lightweight contender Michael Johnson (16-9) Saturday at UFC on Fox inside Amway Center in Orlando. For Diaz, it will mark his 21st appearance in the UFC.\n\nThe younger brother of UFC welterweight Nick Diaz, Nate has had his issues with the promotion in recent years, mostly related to an eight-fight deal he signed in 2012. Early last year, the UFC removed Diaz from its official rankings, citing his unwillingness to accept fights as the reason.\n\nAt least for the time being, those issues seem to be resolved and Diaz says he's looking forward to \"big fights\" in the near future.\n\n\"Circumstances are just different now, we'll put it that way,\" said Diaz, when asked about his current contract situation with the UFC. \"There was just miscommunication and stuff like that. I'm good with the UFC. Everything is great.\n\n\"I'm doing what I've got to do and I want to get back on the scene and get some big fights. I want the biggest fights possible. This fight [against Johnson] will get me going. He's ranked No. 5. I'm going to fight him and then do my thing after that.\"\n\nDiaz is 1-3 in his last four appearances dating back to a decision loss to Ben Henderson for the UFC lightweight title in December 2012. In the fight against dos Anjos, who is the current lightweight champion, Diaz said he was only 10 percent due to the injured rib.\n\nHe claims the UFC was made aware he wasn't going to make weight well before fight week, but neither he nor the promotion made it public. According to Diaz, the injured rib didn't hurt during the dos Anjos bout, but it did derail his preparations.\n\n\"I was about 10 percent, and the guy still couldn't take me down,\" Diaz said. \"I told him that while we were fighting. I couldn't prepare for the fight, I had to baby my rib all the way up to it. I asked the UFC if we could make a catchweight because I knew I wasn't going to make weight. Everybody acted shocked when I missed but no one was shocked.\"\n\nDiaz was briefly linked to a fight against welterweight Matt Brown at UFC 189 in July, but he said the UFC never properly contacted him about it and it ultimately fell through. According to Diaz, he was later contacted about the possibility of fighting now-featherweight champion Conor McGregor at that event, when McGregor's original opponent Jose Aldo fell off the card -- but once again, bout agreements failed to materialize.\n\nAhead of just his second appearance in 24 months, Diaz says he has continued to train this entire time and his skill set is sharper than ever. He has paid close attention to the lightweight division and hasn't been overly impressed by what he has seen.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm fighting for a paycheck,\" Diaz said. \"Everybody is. They can say, 'I fight because it's my destiny' or some bulls--- like that, but we all fight to get paid. But I'm also fighting for myself. If I'm not fighting, I'm dying. So, I need to be doing something.\n\n\"It's hard to sit back and not fight when there are so many fights going on and no one's getting the job done. I don't think it's that hard to have a good fight, and it's irritating. You train hard and then sit back and watch these fights and it's like, 'How am I going to sit back while this s--- goes on?' It's ridiculous. I haven't seen a good lightweight fight in a long time. I might as well just get in there and fight.\"", "Brazil attorney general alleges bribes tied to Rio Olympics": "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's attorney general is investigating allegations that bribes were paid to a powerful lawmaker to help secure contracts for the building of venues and other works for next year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn documents obtained by The Associated Press, Attorney General Rodrigo Janot accuses Eduardo Cunha, speaker of the lower house in Brazil's two-chamber legislature, of receiving 1.9 million Brazilian reals ($475,000) from the construction company OAS to craft legislation favorable for the company.\n\nCunha has called the allegations \"ridiculous\" in comments to local media, while OAS refused to comment.\n\nThe investigation is the first linking corruption to the billions being spent on Olympic building projects.\n\nOAS is involved with building the BMX, mountain bike and canoeing venues at Deodoro in northern Rio, the second-largest cluster of Olympic venues.\n\nThe constructor is also involved in work on high-speed bus lanes, the 8 billion reals ($2 billion) renovation of Rio's port, and projects to clean the polluted waters in Barra da Tijuca, the area where the main Olympic Park is being built.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee referred an email seeking comment to local organizers, who did not immediately respond.\n\nUnder the Brazilian system, the prosecutor is largely an investigator and it's up to the court -- in this case Brazil's Supreme Court -- to accept a case.\n\nIn the 190-page report, Janot says that Cunha \"treated the lower house as a center for trading bribes for bills.\"\n\nThe report alleges that Cunha guided legislation approved in 2012 that gave tax exemptions to all Olympic-related construction works, and exempted import taxes on some foreign goods needed for the Olympics.\n\nThe Brazilian government's executive branch estimated the tax breaks amounted to 3.8 billion reals ($1 billion).\n\nJanot also said Cunha used \"his position as a lawmaker to craft business-friendly legislation that was against the public interest.\" He described Cunha and an OAS executive of being \"part of a criminal organization.\"\n\n\"At least since 2012, Eduardo Cunha has been illegally acting on the behalf of corporations, 'selling' legislation to benefit them,\" the report said. \"That shows he can no longer remain in office.\"\n\nCunha was elevated to speaker earlier this year.\n\nCunha is facing calls for his resignation in connection with a series of scandals.

Glenn James/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nDeAndre Jordan's round trip: How Clips star dissed Dallas\n\nThe view was clear from DeAndre Jordan's house in the Pacific Palisades on the morning of July 3. This time of year, the marine layer that keeps the bluffs above the Pacific Ocean cool burns off early in the day. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and forward Chandler Parsons arrived at Jordan's house just after breakfast, ready to make one last pitch to the man they hoped would anchor their team for at least the next four years.\n\nParsons had been wooing and partying with Jordan for weeks in an elaborate, \"Entourage\"-style recruiting trip through the hottest clubs and most exclusive haunts in Los Angeles and Houston. On the first night of free agency, Parsons, Cuban and Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki took Jordan out for a gluttonous sushi feast in a private room at Nobu in Malibu, a few miles up the road from Jordan's house. After that, Parsons and Cuban had been in constant contact with the 26-year-old center. Other teams had gone to meet with Jordan at the offices of his agent, Dan Fegan, in Beverly Hills. But their pitches had been self-contained: an hour or two of the typical marketing presentations and basketball discussions that start to sound the same if you hear too many in too short a time.

On the best of days, Celtics coach Doc Rivers rides Rajon Rondo hard, pushing his stubborn point guard as only a former stubborn point guard can. But this day is different. Doc is more relentless, Rondo more seething. \"He was just pushing and he was just pushing and he was just pushing,\" Kevin Garnett recalls. Rondo glances across the room at Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal. \"They saw me bubbling,\" Rondo remembers. \"They were trying to calm me down. It was too late.\"\n\nWithout warning, Rondo snatches his water bottle and hurls it, full force, at the television monitor, the one airing the game footage that's being used to critique him. The 50-inch flat-screen, mounted on a cart in the center of the room, shatters. \"When he blew the TV up, it was about to go in another direction -- like, the whole thing,\" Garnett says, his voice rising. Rivers, fed up, gives Garnett an order: \"I want Rondo out.\" Garnett obliges. \"He kicked the door off the hinges,\" Garnett says. \"I'll never forget: I had to pick him up and carry him out because it was going like that, and the locker room was suuuper tense.

He was like Dirk Nowitzki today. Guys were all over him.\"\n\nBut while Bird's 3-point skills are well-known, the shot is not something he practiced, thought about, liked or even did very often. Bird never averaged more than three 3-point attempts a game until he turned 30.\n\n\"I can remember if a guy was out at the 3-point line, you wouldn't even go out there and challenge him,\" Bird says. \"Shoot, we didn't guard anybody out there.

If he is going to eventually be a billionaire with this latest deal, James surely wants a bigger prize -- perhaps to someday join his idol Michael Jordan as an NBA owner.\n\nThat is something he has talked about. But just when you think you can see James' plan, understand he has probably envisioned something more expansive.\n\nFor years now, his visions have gone beyond basketball. Why not an NFL owner? Majority owner of a Premier League team? Head of his own Hollywood production and talent firm? What about running for public office? James and his team have shown they don't operate within established parameters.\n\nHe's past the point of picking up a large paycheck for putting his name or face on a product. As James slowly became obsessed with the bigger picture and started thinking in terms of 10 figures and not eight or nine, he realized he wanted to rise above someone who endorses brands. He wanted to own the brands. If he was associated with it, he wanted equity in it. -- Brian Windhorst\n\nNBA All-Star weekend returned to New York City for the first time since 1998.

Editor's Picks Top fantasy QBs falter in critical Week 16 Eric Karabell examines Championship Week 16 and notes many passers underachieved, including Cam Newton and Tom Brady.\n\nIn previous NFL seasons, one factor fantasy football players had to consider was the possibility of NFL teams sitting notable studs in Week 17 because the game had no implications. This is less of a concern this season. Despite only two playoff spots remaining up for grabs, there is plenty at stake in terms of seeding, so Week 17 should feature most team's regular starters.\n\nThat means fantasy owners shouldn't have to seek out too many contingency plans this week because of players resting. As a matter of fact, your lineup should mostly set itself. Play the guys you've been leaning on heavily. But below is a list of players who could serve as viable fine-tuning pieces to help you win your championship this Sunday.\n\nBilal Powell, RB, New York Jets (40.9 percent): For the fourth straight week, Powell led the Jets in fantasy points among running backs, posting 90 total yards on 12 touches in a win over the Patriots. He was in the conversation for low-end RB2 consideration in PPR formats leading into Week 16, and he's probably a borderline top-25 play in standard scoring for Week 17.\n\nMike Gillislee, RB, Buffalo Bills (8.9 percent): Gillislee found the end zone on Sunday for the third straight game. He had nine carries, eight fewer than Karlos Williams, but that came in a game that LeSean McCoy sat out with an injury. If McCoy returns to action on Sunday against the Jets, I wouldn't recommend using Gillislee. If McCoy sits, Gillislee can be a flex consideration.\n\nDontrelle Inman, WR, San Diego Chargers (6.4 percent): Inman has assumed the No. 1 receiver role in San Diego on an offense that has been up and down of late. Coming off an eight-catch, 82-yard, one-touchdown effort in Week 16, Inman is likely to be near the top 30 of wide receivers in my Week 17 ranks. He faces a tough matchup against Denver but certainly has value based on volume of targets.\n\nIsaiah Crowell, RB, Cleveland Browns (36.3 percent): If you play in a standard scoring league, Crowell is going to be a notable name for flex spots. He posted 14 or more fantasy points in two of his last three outings. He faces a stingy Steelers run defense in Week 17, but if he gets 15 touches, Crowell has a chance to do enough to make him a worthwhile play.\n\nCharles Sims, RB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers (40.1 percent): The fifth-leading receiver in terms of yards among running backs, Sims has previously been mentioned for PPR leagues. He has now eclipsed 1,000 total yards, and has been good for just about 10 touches per game.\n\nTheo Riddick, RB, Detroit Lions (34.7 percent): Much like Sims, Riddick is a terrific receiver. He has double-digit points in nine of 15 games this season in the PPR format, and is a worthwhile flex play for Week 17 in those leagues, especially ones with 12 teams or more. He is an electric player in the open field.\n\nKeshawn Martin, WR, New England Patriots (8.1 percent): The statuses of Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola remain up in the air for Week 17, as the Patriots still have something to play for against the Dolphins; with a win, they would clinch home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. If Edelman and Amendola sit, Martin has value as a deeper-league PPR option.\n\nDonald Brown, RB, San Diego Chargers (12.2 percent): The matchup against Denver is not good for Week 17, but Brown has had 31 total touches in the past two weeks. He's a deep-league add, and new owners will hope he gets some goal-line work for San Diego.\n\nDuJuan Harris, RB, San Francisco 49ers (5.5 percent): If Shaun Draughn returns to the field in Week 17, Harris' value probably goes away. But after signing with San Francisco last week, he led the team with 11 rushes for 73 yards. He's a deep-league flex play.\n\nJoique Bell, RB, Detroit Lions (29.4 percent): Any owners adding Bell will be hoping he gets the goal-line work for Detroit. He has seen that quite a bit lately, with three 1-yard rushing touchdowns in his past five games. He'll be a flex play in standard scoring for deeper leagues.\n\nJermaine Kearse, WR, Seattle Seahawks (12.2 percent): Looking for a PPR flex consideration in a deeper league? Consider Kearse, who in the past three weeks has double-digit scoring in PPR: 14, 18 and 12 points, respectively. The Seahawks' passing offense cooled off a bit against St. Louis in Week 16, but the play of the group in the five preceding weeks is too good to ignore, even in a tough matchup against Arizona.", "Serena Williams named Sports Illustrated Sportsperson of the Year": "Mike and Mike, along with ESPN's Cris Carter, react to Serena Williams being named Sports Illustrated 2015 Sportsperson of the Year and Mike Greenberg believes American Pharoah deserves the award.

(1:44)\n\nThe Suns have dodged some of the worst big-picture consequences of building along two paths at once for an admittedly impatient owner, but the tumult of that kind of scattershot roster churn can become its own monster -- and sabotage the present-day team.\n\nPhoenix has the ingredients of a solid team: Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight, last season's controversial trade acquisition, running pick-and-rolls with Tyson Chandler diving to the rim; Markieff Morris spotting up to make plays, and a pile of wings young and old competing for minutes around that core. It just hasn't come together for reasons that seem obvious in retrospect, and it cost two highly-regarded assistants, Mike Longabardi and Jerry Sichting, their jobs Monday after Robert Sarver, the team's owner, called an all-hands-on-deck meeting. That leaves coach Jeff Hornacek, in the last guaranteed year of his contract, on shaky ground as the team enters a brutal three-game stretch against Cleveland, San Antonio, and Oklahoma City.\n\nHead coaches can survive an assistant purge -- it's practically a Dwane Casey special at this point in Toronto -- but the Suns are 12-20, staring at a possible 12-23, with Eric Bledsoe nursing yet another meniscus injury and no obvious solutions to any of the problems that have undone them. No lineup without Bledsoe has logged even 30 minutes, and the team has been worse when Knight plays solo, per NBA.com. Knight will get his chance now, and the young wings, especially T.J. Warren, Devin Booker, and the lost Archie Goodwin, have to step up.\n\nThe disappointment starts with Morris, who has been a bricklaying malcontent since the Suns traded his brother, Marcus, to Detroit in a salary dump that freed Phoenix to chase LaMarcus Aldridge -- a low-odds play that slipped through their fingers. A lot has been made of how Phoenix has become prisoner to its accidental rise in 2013-14, when the team traded Marcin Gortat and tried to tank. \"We were never trying to lose games,\" Sarver told me over the summer. \"We were trying to play young players who we thought could be part of the next great Phoenix team, and some of them just played a lot better than we thought they would.\"\n\nThose Suns won 48 games, and that unexpected success emboldened Sarver and Ryan McDonough, a savvy general manager, to chase immediate wins at the expense of long-term team-building.\n\nThat is true, but look again that 2013-14 Suns roster and ask yourself what cornerstone young players the Suns have forsaken to build their current mishmash team. Marcus Morris is the only candidate. He'd be the Suns' best small forward now, but Marcus Morris alone is not determining the fate of any franchise. The Suns did not destroy a young team destined to grow into a contender.\n\nThe front office has stocked the roster with promising young players. Booker is spitting flames from deep, Warren is a floater artist, and Alex Len should grow into a solid starting center. The Suns swiped two first-round draft picks from Miami, including an unprotected 2021 pick, for Goran Dragic on an expiring contract, even though other teams chasing Dragic got the impression he had already worked out a deal to sign in Miami. (Heat officials have denied that, and the league has said it received no formal complaints).\n\nThey'll have cap space galore, and an interesting cache of trade assets. That cap space won't be worth as much when almost every team has it, and they can't quite compete with Boston and Philly in the trade-for-a-star market.\n\nAs I've written before, the weird series of deals in which Phoenix effectively exchanged Isaiah Thomas and a lightly-protected first-round pick from the Lakers -- top-3 protected in both '16 and 17, then unprotected and one of the most valuable trade chips in the league -- for Brandon Knight and a Cleveland first-rounder will almost certainly end up a net-loss. Depending on the fate of that Lakers pick, protected if it's top-3 this season and unprotected afterward, it could be a devastating net loss the franchise regrets for years. There are reasonable ways to defend the deals, but Phoenix clearly sold low on Thomas and his insanely cheap contract; he might be better than Knight straight up, even without Knight's positional versatility. There is real opportunity cost there, and in spending cap space on Tyson Chandler.\n\nIt has been a whirlwind two years for Phoenix, so much so that it can be hard to spot any guiding plan. \"It has been a roller-coaster, for sure,\" McDonough told me over the summer. But at least they've satisfied all those competing demands without totally mortgaging the franchise's future. They almost found art in chaos.\n\nBut chaos takes its toll anyway. The Detroit trade alienated Markieff Morris, and he has failed horribly to deliver on his promise as a playmaking four around those Chandler pick-and-rolls. The Knight-Bledsoe pairing has been awkward, and has created some minor locker-room tension, according to sources familiar with the matter. Both thrive as lead ball-handlers, and Knight has bristled over the years whenever anyone has labeled him as something other than a pure point guard.\n\nThere is a your-turn, my-turn element to Phoenix's offense that can devolve into predictable stagnancy, one reason this team has been such a disaster in crunch-time. The Suns are 3-9 in games that entered the final three minutes within three points in either direction, and they've squeezed out just 81.8 points per 100 possessions in those minutes -- the fourth-worst mark in the league. (And, really, it's third-worst, since the Sixers don't count).\n\nBeing dependent on two small guards can be fatal when defenses dial in late. Morris was their best crunch-time option last season, but Hornacek has banished him to the fringes of the rotation. A simple Bledsoe pick-and-roll has been Hornacek's go-to crunch-time call this season, and it has produced mostly bad shots. Bledsoe is a solid 3-point shooter, but defenders still dare to go under picks against him. When opponents switch, Bledsoe tends to back it out, drive one-on-one against a big guy, and launch difficult floaters. Knight has compounded things with Keystone Kops-level gaffes, including last-second turnovers at Memphis and Detroit that cost Phoenix games. Are boneheaded turnovers and slippery hands the coach's fault?\n\nThe broader lack of continuity and motion is troubling. Stop the first pick-and-roll, and the Suns offense might die; whoever ends up the ball goes into isolation mode. The Suns are 25th in assist rate this season after ranking dead last a year ago, per NBA.com. For a go-go team of speedsters, the Suns sometimes take an alarming amount of time to laze into half-court sets. Long possessions aren't necessarily a bad thing -- the Spurs have more of them than almost anyone -- but San Antonio cuts and passes with purpose. The Suns jog to their spots, whiff on picks, and pound the ball. They never found a way to replace the shooting of Channing Frye, which opened up wide driving lanes for Phoenix's point guards.\n\nTeams can crunch the Suns' spacing around those late-game Bledsoe pick-and-rolls by playing off Morris and P.J. Tucker, ice cold this season, to the point that Hornacek has closed games with a spacier front-court of Jon Leuer and Mirza Teletovic. That duo doesn't bring enough defense, and as bad as the Suns have been on offense in gut-check time, they've been even worse on the other end -- a mess of soft one-on-one defense, poor communication, and plain old bad luck in the form of opponents hitting contested jumpers. (It has been nothing compared to last season, when the Suns lost a sad/hilarious number of games on improbable buzzer-beaters).\n\nThe same kind of mistakes plague Phoenix's defense for the first 45 minutes of games. The Suns rank just 20th in points allowed per possession, and they just don't communicate well -- the problem Tyson Chandler was brought in to solve. Their weak-side help can be atrocious; too many opposing big men set picks, and roll to the rim for dunks without any help defender bumping them. Phoenix would be near the top of the league in shoulder shrugs and pointed fingers, especially when younger players are in the game. Can we get the SportVU cameras to track that stuff?\n\nWeaknesses from last season linger; the Suns still foul too much, and they're terrible in transition, hanging around for offensive rebounds they never get as opponents fly by them.\n\nIt's hard to know from the outside how much of this is on Hornacek and his staff, including the deposed Longabardi, a Tom Thibodeau acolyte in charge of the defense. (Longabardi is a smart, workaholic coach who will land on his feet -- perhaps with Thibodeau). Morris has checked out. Bledsoe should be an elite defender, but he half-asses his way through too many possessions. Chandler's hamstring injury hurt. The rotation has been in disarray. Warren and Booker have done well on offense, but they're understandably behind on the other end. Both received spot starts, but it's clear Hornacek trusts the veteran know-how of Tucker and others.\n\nLen and Chandler have flip-flopped starter and backup roles, highlighting Chandler's awkward fit. The Suns signed Chandler as a lure for Aldridge, and talked optimistically about how they could find enough minutes for both Chandler and Len. Aldridge chose the Spurs, and now Chander is just kind of here -- playing 35 minutes one night, 15 the next, the threat of his lob dunk neutered by working in so-so spacing with score-first guards who love pull-up jumpers. Playing five-man defense on a string takes chemistry, and this hasn't been the best environment for developing it.\n\nHornacek brought Knight off the bench for a game last week, separating him more from Bledsoe, before reinserting him into the starting lineup the next game. Ronnie Price has played too much, even though he has exceeded expectations.\n\nAll of this gives off the feel of a team trying to figure out too much on the fly, under a coach who wanted an extension and didn't even get his 2016-17 team option picked up. Any coach in that situation would feel pressure to win today, and that can make him reluctant to play younger guys in which the front office has invested so much hope.\n\nThere are so many variables pulling in different directions. That is the consequence of how the Suns have churned the roster after their shocking success two years ago. They've come out of that chaos with a cleaner long-term picture than a lot of franchises would manage, but chaos can rip a team apart.\n\nHornacek is a good coach. If the Suns fire him, he will draw interest in what figures to be a frothy head-coaching market this summer. Brooklyn, Sacramento, Washington, Phoenix, Memphis, Houston, Minnesota, Portland, and the Lakers all could have open jobs, and the pool of candidates will be loaded with big names: Jeff Van Gundy (quietly a candidate for the Washington job), Scott Brooks, Thibodeau, Monty Williams, and potentially Dave Joerger, Mike D'Antoni, Hornacek, Luke Walton, and others. As Howard Beck of Bleacher Report noted Sunday, there have already been rumors of Phoenix chasing Walton if they dump Hornacek.\n\nHornacek appears to want to stay in the NBA, according to league sources, and the Suns would be smart to give him another chance. He's smart, and creative. He hasn't done his best work this season, and there are clearly things he can improve upon. This is his first head job, after all. His brief \"no technicals\" rule last season seemed dictatorial, and he hasn't been able to salvage the team's relationships with Dragic, Thomas, and now Morris. Other people, including McDonough and Sarver, share in that job, and the team's issues with those players stem more from personnel moves than Hornacek's coaching. But he hasn't been able to work any player-coach magic on that front.\n\nThe Suns need to be careful here. If they think Hornacek is their coach of the future, they shouldn't let a bad season decide his job status. And without Bledsoe, this could turn into a very bad season. That's OK. Ride out the losing for a few months, snag a lottery pick, and continue building the young core. They can do that while still working the trade market and dangling max cap space at free agents, but any extra dose of continuity would be healthy for the Suns.", "St. Louis Cardinals reinforce rotation with Mike Leake": "The signing: The St. Louis Cardinals have reached an agreement on a long-term contract with free-agent pitcher Mike Leake. The deal is reportedly for five years and $80 million and includes a mutual option for a sixth year.\n\nIt has been a slow offseason thus far for St. Louis general manager John Mozeliak. The Cardinals made a spirited bid to sign marquee free agent David Price, only to get steamrolled by Boston\u2019s seven-year, $217 million offer. Then incumbent right fielder Jason Heyward signed with the Chicago Cubs and made some observations about St. Louis' aging core that didn\u2019t sit particularly well with Cardinals manager Mike Matheny.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks, San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers expressed varying degrees of interest in Leake. But the Giants spent $220 million on Johnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija, and Arizona took care of the top of its rotation by signing Zack Greinke to a $206.5 million deal and acquiring Shelby Miller in a trade with Atlanta.\n\nThe Cardinals, according to a source, came at Leake with a strong offer about a week ago and then waited for a resolution. St. Louis had been hesitant to go beyond four years, so the addition of a fifth year in the contract was a significant concession.\n\nJustin K. Aller/Getty Images\n\nThe reason: After losing Lance Lynn to Tommy John surgery and John Lackey to the Cubs through free agency, the Cardinals were in need of someone to absorb innings in the rotation. During MLB's GM meetings six weeks ago, Mozeliak acknowledged that it might be time for St. Louis to take a dive into the free-agent market. The Cardinals have endured a run of significant injuries over the past year, and they have only so much talent on the farm to plug the holes.\n\n\u201cI don't know if we're saying, 'Enough already.' It's more like, 'How long can you take the body blows?'\" Mozeliak said in early November. \u201cThat's why it might make sense to start thinking about outside markets and understanding, 'Maybe it's time to be more aggressive.'\"\n\nThe impact: You\u2019ll get some difference of opinion on Leake. One scout recently characterized him as a \u201cNo. 3\u00bd type\" starter. With a career ratio of 6.1 strikeouts per nine innings, he\u2019s the quintessential pitch-to-contact guy. Lynn threw his fastball a National League-high 85.4 percent of the time in 2015 (a tick above Bartolo Colon of the Mets). Leake, in contrast, relied on a five-pitch approach and used his fastball a mere 44.3 percent of the time.\n\nOne attribute Leake brings is durability. Over the past three seasons, he ranks 18th among MLB starters with 598 2/3 innings. He\u2019s also an exceptional athlete and a good hitter, with a career batting average of .212. It\u2019s no accident that the bulk of the interest in Leake this winter came from National League clubs.\n\nLeake slots into a rotation that already included Adam Wainwright, Michael Wacha and Carlos Martinez, who is recovering from a shoulder strain that forced him to shut it down in September and expects to be ready by spring training. Jaime Garcia will be in the mix again, health permitting, and the Cardinals have organizational depth with Marco Gonzales, Tyler Lyons and Tim Cooney.\n\nNow that Mozeliak has upgraded his rotation and given Cardinals fans a reason to feel good before the holiday break, he can turn his attention to the next big item on his agenda -- finding a bat to help compensate for the loss of Heyward. The Cardinals\u2019 next significant move will probably have to wait until after the new year.", "Rory McIlroy targets Masters and world numberone spot with busy 2016 start": "Rory McIlroy will take on a busier schedule at the beginning of the 2016 season in an attempt to regain the world No.1 spot before the Masters in April.\n\nMcIlroy trails Jordan Spieth and Jason Day in the world rankings but is targeting a return to the summit before next year's first major at Augusta.\n\nThe Northern Irishman played five tournaments ahead of the 2015 Masters, in which he finished a career-high fourth. McIlroy needs the Masters to complete a career Grand Slam.\n\n\"If I can get off to a good start next year, I can get back to number one going into the Masters,\" McIlroy is quoted as saying by the BBC. \"I'm going to play two more tournaments leading up to Augusta in April.\"\n\n\"I need to feel I'm right in the middle of the season at Augusta. Over the last couple of years, I've played pretty well at Augusta but I've got off to a little bit of a slow start each time.\n\n\"Whether that was because I was a little bit under-golfed, that definitely won't be the case in 2016.\"\n\nMcIlroy was recently named European Tour Golfer of the Year and the 26-year-old picked up another award on Friday when it was announced he had won the Association of Golf Writers' trophy. He becomes only the third player to secure the prestigious award on three occasions, after Seve Ballesteros and Lee Westwood.\n\n\"When you think of the contributions that Seve and Lee made to European golf over the years, I am delighted to be linked with them at such an early age, and clearly I'm hoping to do enough to win the AGW trophy in future years as well,\" McIlroy said.\n\nThe four-time major winner edged Britain and Ireland's Walker Cup team, who beat the United States' leading amateurs 16.5-9.5 at Royal Lytham and St Annes in September, and Englishman Andy Sullivan to the award.\n\nSullivan finished third following an impressive breakthrough year on the European Tour: only Sullivan and McIlroy were three-time winners.\n\nMcIlroy's season ended in fine fashion last month when he won the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai to successfully defend his Race to Dubai crown.\n\n\"Winning in Dubai again meant a huge amount to me and enabled me to look at the year as a whole in a different light. It has also given me that bit of momentum going into next season,\" McIlroy added.\n\n\"I'd also like to congratulate our Walker Cup team as well on their stunning success. It must have been a very difficult decision for the golf writers.\"", "Why Roger Federer's coaching move could be bad news for Novak Djokovic": "The reasoning behind Roger Federer's latest move, hiring Ivan Ljubicic to replace Stefan Edberg as part of his coaching team, probably can be summed up in three words: Rust never sleeps.\n\nFederer might be more aware of that maxim than any other athlete on the planet, and it explains why he's brought a voice that's likely to be very different from Edberg's into the mix. To some, it's a puzzling decision.\n\nTrue, Federer just completed his best year in a long time, and at age 34 no less. He won six titles, including a Masters 1000, and reached two Grand Slam finals -- both ending in losses to top-ranked Novak Djokovic.\n\nMore than anything, Roger Federer, right, wants the trophy that matters. (Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)\n\nAlso true: Edberg, who had never intended to be a coach -- much less a coach of Federer -- had already been on board for a year longer than anticipated. His contribution as an attack-minded player had been absorbed and incorporated into Federer's game, culminating symbolically if not literally in the Sneak Attack by Roger (SABR) strategy. The partnership was wildly successful.\n\nBut ...\n\nFederer lost to Djokovic in the two biggest matches the men played, and that means Federer was not satisfied. He isn't the kind of guy who's going to say to himself, \"Well, that was great, considering I'm 34.\" He's going to think about what he can do to beat Djokovic the next time they play. Hence, Ljubicic.\n\n\"First and foremost, if you don't think you can [improve], you won't,\" ESPN tennis analyst Brad Gilbert told ESPN.com. The former coach of Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick added, \"By the usual standard, Roger had a remarkable year, but what's really amazing is that this is a guy who really thinks he can still get better. He's never satisfied with the status quo, and right now he has to think about what he can do to beat Djokovic in a five-set match. A hire like this is going to make Roger believe he can do that again. He's going to look at things in a fresh way.\"\n\nIn some ways, the Ljubicic hire is a departure from the course Federer had pursued for some years. Although Swiss Davis Cup captain Severin Luthi has been a permanent coaching fixture in Federer's camp, as a mature pro and Grand Slam champion, Federer was also coached by three men known for their passion for attacking tennis. In order: Tony Roche, Paul Annacone and Edberg.\n\nIt was always difficult to see the fruits of the trio's coaching labors. Roche, whose own serve-and-volley game back at the dawn of Open tennis was one based on wicked lefty slice, often seemed more father figure than tactician.\n\nAnnacone worked hard on trying to get Federer to attack more, but the results didn't really manifest until Edberg joined Team Federer -- presumably bearing a similar message. Federer's aggression took a quantum leap this season, Edberg's second year on board. The results speak for themselves.\n\nWhat will Ljubicic bring to this table?\n\nIt's an interesting and in some ways puzzling question. A 6-foot-4 Croatian who never played a major final but briefly held the No. 3 singles ranking (2006), Ljubicic was known for his atomic serve and powerful forehand. Like Federer, he hits a one-handed backhand. But he employs a longer stroke and hits a heavier ball than the Swiss star.\n\nFederer's Achilles' heel is a backhand that's a bit on the light side and prone to flying wild. Either way, it can be broken down by heavy bombardment.\n\nEditor's Picks The remarkable story of Federer's new coach Ljubicic Stefan Edberg's successor, Ivan Ljubicic, has been a players' leader and once fled the Balkan Wars on a cargo plane, but what will he offer friend Roger Federer as his new coach?\n\nFederer splits with Edberg, brings on Ljubicic Roger Federer has parted ways with coach Stefan Edberg, who will be replaced by former world No. 3 Ivan Ljubicic. 1 Related\n\nLjubicic's movement was perhaps his greatest weakness as a pro, but that's an area in which Federer needs no help. Over the years, Ljubicic developed a reputation as an excellent strategist and tactician. Federer was more aware of that than most of his peers, partly because the men are friends and partly because they are of the same generation. (Ljubicic is just over two years older than Federer.) They once were frequent practice partners.\n\n\"These guys know each other,\" Gilbert said, \"but it's hard to imagine that Roger would have hired Ivan unless the coach had already presented a bunch of ideas and opinions to him.\"\n\nIt probably didn't hurt Ljubicic's cause that he's a friend and neighbor of Djokovic's in Monte Carlo and might have some insight on how to slow down the Serb that others don't.\n\nFederer will surely be dangerous next year, for he knows that rust never sleeps. Then again, Djokovic doesn't either -- at least not in the way that is likely to make life at Grand Slam events easier for his rivals, including Roger Federer.", "The players trending up and down in the NHL over the past week.": "The players who have been trending up and down over the past week in the NHL.\n\nEASTERN CONFERENCE\n\nStepping up\n\nCraig Anderson, Ottawa Senators: The netminder has been outstanding of late.

(1:08)\n\nAnthony Davis has a simple solution for the New Orleans Pelicans' early-season woes: Play harder.\n\nAfter a loss to the Orlando Magic on Monday night that dropped the Pelicans to 10-21, the All-Star forward took part of the blame in what he believes is the team easing off the gas pedal against opponents.\n\n\"We just don't play hard all the time,\" Davis told reporters, according to The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. \"That starts with our first unit coming out and setting the pace and setting the tone for the rest of the game and setting the tone for the guys that sub in especially after halftime. That's kind of been our thing this year. It starts with the first unit, and it starts with me.\"\n\nThe Magic opened the game with a 9-0 run, then used a 15-6 spurt to start the second half and a 12-4 run to begin the fourth quarter to take an 87-69 lead in an eventual 104-89 victory.\n\nThe start of the second half was a particular sore spot for New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry, who benched Davis along with the rest of the first unit.\n\n\"The first group wasn't going to play, and if you're not going to play, then we've got to have other guys in the game,\" Gentry said. \"If you're not going to compete at the level that we need to, then we have to make changes and put other people in. So, we tried that.\n\n\"I thought [the second unit] did a good job, and then we had a couple breakdowns. I think we got it back to six, and then we had a couple of breakdowns. But we've just got to decide what we're going to be as a team. Are we going to be a team that gives in or are we going to be a team that competes like crazy, and have teams beat us and not have us beat ourselves? So that's really where we are.\"\n\nGentry also said his team needs to be tougher.\n\n\"They were physical with us, and we didn't handle it,\" he said. \"That's our reputation, and until we do something about it, that is what teams are going to do, they're going to get into us.''\n\nDavis admitted frustration, but not specifically with Gentry's decision to sit his starters.\n\n\"It was frustration with the game,\" he said. \"We're coming out the third quarter and we're not playing hard. They are doing everything they want and we're turning the ball over. We were down four then we were down 10. It was just frustration with us not playing hard, including myself.\"\n\nThings didn't get any better for Davis when he re-entered the game later in the third quarter. He went down after a midair collision with Magic guard Victor Oladipo. Davis was defending the rim when Oladipo blew past his defender at the 3-point line and soared unimpeded at Davis, sending the power forward crumpling to the ground. Davis left the court and went into the locker room before returning with just under eight minutes left in the game. He didn't score again.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "Pittsburgh Steelers offense grinds to halt at worst time": "Ravens quarterback Ryan Mallett and Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams receive the game balls from NFL Nation reporters Jeremy Fowler and Jamison Hensley in this AFC North shocker. (1:51)\n\nPITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers tried to process what just happened, and their leader pointed the finger directly at himself, which is typically what people want to hear.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my fault,\u201d Ben Roethlisberger said from his locker after Sunday\u2019s 20-17 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThere\u2019s no way the Steelers expected this -- a 215-yard, two-interception performance in the passing game that slowed the league\u2019s fastest offensive train to a spark-inducing grind.\n\nThis could be an aberration. The Steelers will probably score 43 points on Cleveland this week and it might be just as difficult to frame as this curious loss is.\n\n\u201cWe did a horrible job today,\u201d Antonio Brown said.\n\nMartavis Bryant and the Steelers offense was uncharacteristically rusty in Sunday's loss to the Ravens. Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n\nThey can unleash their frustration on the Browns with rekindled offensive wizardry and it probably won\u2019t matter. The Jets, who must lose for the Steelers to have a shot at the playoffs, have won five straight and are poised for a sixth over Buffalo.\n\nMake no mistake, the Steelers seemed to sense a potential trap. During the week, they swatted down offensive comparisons to the Greatest Show on Turf and questions about a team poised to make postseason noise.\n\nThis was the team no one wanted to face, after all.\n\nBut this was Baltimore. Things get weird in Baltimore. Perceptions did not meet the locker-room reality. The Steelers knew how fragile this game is.\n\nThe matchups they used to exploit on offense were turned on them this week. This wasn\u2019t about effort or integrity or heart. The thin margins in the deep passing game the Steelers had dominated became too thin to sustain. That they scored 30 or more points for six straight games was incredible. Perhaps they were due for a dud.\n\nJust not now.\n\nI thought they would keep it rolling, because of all the legitimate offensive weapons.\n\nThis offense is about precision. Bold, accurate passes and elite receiver play. The offense can take chances because of it. The team is confident the big plays will be there. But there\u2019s danger in that, too. A few inches to the left or right on a throw or a route, and things can get ugly.\n\nThat\u2019s how the Steelers lost the turnover battle 2-0, and that\u2019s how it watched the Jets take ownership of the AFC wild-card picture.\n\nMike Tomlin said it perfectly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re capable of beating anyone, but we\u2019re also capable of losing to anyone,\u201d Tomlin said from the podium in his postgame news conference. \u201cWe didn\u2019t handle the business in the stadium today so we\u2019re left to look around at other stadiums. Such is life this time of year when you don\u2019t do what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers needed more from receivers other than Brown and didn't get it, resulting in a 122-yard dip from Roethlisberger\u2019s previous average of 337 yards per game. Markus Wheaton basically admitted as much. He said Brown faced double-teams, which created opportunities for him and Martavis Bryant. They combined to make four catches for 47 yards (41 from Wheaton) on eight targets. Either they weren\u2019t getting open consistently or Roethlisberger didn\u2019t target them enough. The Steelers got yardage on dump-offs in the middle of the field to DeAngelo Williams and Heath Miller but by then they were playing from behind. The Ravens played well but not that well. This is an average defense at best.\n\nFinding any rhythm is difficult when an offense goes 2-of-8 on third downs. Roethlisberger threw the ball on seven of those third downs, completing four passes for 48 yards.\n\nThe defense was unspectacular but played well enough to win.\n\nThat should have been enough.\n\nRoethlisberger was simply off his game. Here\u2019s to betting he rounds into form if the Steelers do get a wild-card spot. He\u2019s still just as dangerous.\n\nBut his two interceptions could have mushroomed to three or four pretty easily. He was missing throws he usually makes. As for his second interception on a back-shoulder attempt to Brown that sailed to Brown's left, Roethlisberger said he missed on \u201ca pass we\u2019ve completed thousands of times.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019ll get many more with Brown, who eclipsed 120 receptions for the second consecutive year, joining Cris Carter in that exclusive club.\n\nJust not in the postseason this year, unless Rex Ryan comes through.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we can do now is play, win, watch and hope,\u201d Roethlisberger said.", "Daily Fantasy Basketball: Building blocks, fades for Dec. 29": "As part of ESPN Fantasy's efforts to give intel to daily fantasy gamers on whom to target and whom to avoid in DFS, our fantasy basketball experts are here to show you which players they are building their teams around and which ones they are fading. Today's panel features picks from Tom Carpenter, Renee Miller, Matthew Wittyngham and Joe Kaiser.\n\nPlayer to build around\n\nTom Carpenter \u2013 Andre Drummond, C, Detroit Pistons ($9,400)\n\nDrummond has been crushing opposing frontcourts lately, racking up a 22-22 line and a 33-21 line in the process. Tonight he gets the Knicks. Who is going to slow him down? Robin Lopez? Kyle O\u2019Quinn? Kevin Seraphin? How about nobody.\n\nRenee Miller -- Paul Millsap, PF, Atlanta Hawks ($7,700)\n\nThere are a lot of studs on the court for a relatively small Tuesday slate, but Millsap stands out for a couple of reasons. First, he's playing in what Vegas has as the highest-scoring game, and the line suggests a competitive affair (Houston, -2.5). Second, the Rockets allow the second-most fantasy points to the power forward position this season. Lastly, Millsap has been on fire lately, averaging more than 20 points per game, contributing multiple steals, assists and a couple of blocks in addition to averaging almost nine rebounds per game.\n\nMatthew Wittyngham -- Kevin Durant, SF, Oklahoma City Thunder ($10,000)\n\nKevin Durant is in incredible scoring form with at least 20-plus points in each game he\u2019s played since missing six due to injury in mid-November. He goes up against the Bucks tonight, who are allowing the seventh-most fantasy points per game to opposing starting small forwards. The Bucks are also posting the NBA's fourth-worst defensive efficiency at 105.9.\n\nJoe Kaiser -- Reggie Jackson, PG, Detroit Pistons ($7,300)\n\nJackson has 50-point upside on DraftKings, and the Knicks rank 20th in fantasy points allowed to point guards, which is a great combination for someone at this reasonable salary on a short slate. Jackson has surpassed 60 fantasy points three times in the past 15 games, to give you an idea of the kind of ceiling he has Tuesday.\n\nPlayer to fade\n\nTom Carpenter \u2013 James Harden, SG, Houston Rockets ($10,300)\n\nHarden\u2019s uninspiring play of late has caused his contract price to sink a bit, but it hasn\u2019t sunk far enough to pony up for him unless he has a perfect matchup. A tilt against a defensively sound Hawks team that has kept shooting guards in check this season is not such a matchup.\n\nRenee Miller -- Michael Carter-Williams, PG, Milwaukee Bucks ($6,700)\n\nIf you're looking to take advantage of the high-scoring potential of this game, look elsewhere (like to the Thunder). Jerryd Bayless returned to the court last night and was terrific in 27 minutes (32 DraftKings points), but more importantly, he cut right into Carter-Williams' value. Carter-Williams played just 21 minutes and took only eight shots from the field. He recorded zero steals or assists. The DvP against point guards is the Thunder's best mark (they allow the 10th-most fantasy points to the position) but I think Carter-Williams and Bayless, who may be restricted in the second half of the back-to-back, are both too risky to use tonight.\n\nMatthew Wittyngham -- Carmelo Anthony, SF, New York Knicks ($8,300)\n\nMelo has put up at least 30 fantasy points in his past eight games, including a couple of 50-plus games. But tonight he goes up against the Pistons, who are allowing 22.2 fantasy points per game to opposing small forwards, second fewest in the league behind only the Spurs. Detroit also doesn't allow a lot of points, allowing the seventh-fewest points per game at 97.6. There are better options at SF tonight.\n\nJoe Kaiser -- Kenneth Faried, PF, Denver Nuggets ($6,100)\n\nFaried\u2019s greatest strength on the court is rebounding, and that is going to be tested in a matchup against rebounding monster Kevin Love and the rest of Cleveland\u2019s huge frontline (Timofey Mozgov and Tristan Thompson). Faried will likely to have to score at least 20 points to reach his salary value in this one, because rebounds will be tough to come by.", "UFC 194 -- Conor McGregor scores first-round knockout of Jose Aldo to claim featherweight title": "Chael Sonnen and Gilbert Melendez discuss the finish of UFC 194 main event between Conor McGregor and Jose Aldo, with Sonnen saying \"I watched it happen and I still wasn't sure what I was watching.\" (1:08)\n\nLAS VEGAS -- Jose Aldo ruled the featherweight division for seven years.

Stats & Info looks into the historic numbers.\n\nRockhold bloodies Weidman, takes home title Luke Rockhold accomplished the first takedown and defeat of the previously undefeated Chris Weidman to earn the middleweight title in UFC 194 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. 2 Related\n\nIt is also the fastest finish in UFC title-fight history, beating former female bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey's previous mark of 14 seconds set at UFC 184 in February.\n\nAfter the bout -- which headlined UFC 194 inside the MGM Grand Garden Arena, drew an attendance of 16,516 and took in a U.S.-record gate revenue of $10.1 million -- McGregor expressed sympathy for Aldo regarding the brevity of the fight, but insisted his victory was all but inevitable.\n\n\"I feel for Jose,\" McGregor said. \"He's a phenomenal champion. He deserved to go a little bit longer. I still feel, at the end of the day, precision beats power, timing beats speed. All day, it would have happened.\"\n\nAs he nursed a cut on the bridge of his nose, Aldo, 29, immediately said he wanted a rematch.\n\n\"He threw a cross at my chest I wasn't expecting,\" Aldo said via a translator. \"I think we need a rematch. It wasn't really a fight.\"\n\nThe two met in the middle of the cage the second referee John McCarthy started the fight. After a McGregor left broke the ice, Aldo came in hard with a lead right hand and left hook. McGregor, a southpaw, slipped the right hand and threw the counter left that dropped Aldo instantly. As he fell, Aldo's left hook came through and grazed McGregor across the face.\n\nConor McGregor knocked out the only featherweight champion in UFC history, Jose Aldo, in the shortest title fight in UFC history (13 seconds), to claim the title in UFC 194's main event. Ed Mulholland for ESPN\n\nAldo fell to his back, where McGregor followed with two hard hammerfists from a standing position. McCarthy had already started to dive between them as the second blow came down.\n\n\"Nobody can take that left-hand shot,\" McGregor said. \"He's powerful and he's fast, but precision beats power, timing beats speed. That's what you saw there.\n\n\"These are fundamentals. That's all it takes. These are fundamentals, especially when you have my left hand.\"\n\nMcGregor could remain at featherweight and face No. 1 contender Frankie Edgar (20-4-1), a former lightweight champion who is on a five-fight win streak and is coming off a knockout win against Chad Mendes.\n\nThe 27-year-old could also move up to lightweight and challenge for that title. In UFC history, only two men have ever won belts at different weight classes: Randy Couture and BJ Penn.\n\nCurrent lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos is scheduled to defend the title against Donald Cerrone next week in Orlando, Florida.\n\n\"I think that was always his plan,\" UFC president Dana White told SportsCenter. \"He wanted to fight Jose Aldo and then move to 155 and fight for that title.\n\n\"Whoever wins this fight [on Saturday], between Dos Anjos and Cowboy Cerrone, we'll see who wins that fight and go from there.\"\n\nThank you for all the kind messages! I am extremely grateful and proud to be in the position I am in. To the naked eye it was 13 seconds, but to my team and my family it has been a lifetime of work to get to that 13 seconds. Congratulations to the staff at the UFC on a historic week in the sports history and an amazing 2015 for the company. It is an honor to be playing a part in this great companies continued growth and success and an honor to top off a phenomenal week in the sports history. Thank you to all the fans who travelled and made this week what it was!! The traveling Irish are untouchable when it comes to creating the atmosphere needed to make a week like this what it was!! I am forever blown away by the support of my country. We have changed the game forever!!! Respect to a great champion in Jose Aldo. The true greats will always overcome adversity. I wish him and his loyal team well on their journey back. Much respect. Thank you all!!!

In January, McGregor earned a title shot by knocking out Dennis Siver in the second round in UFC 183 at TD Garden in Boston. After the fight, McGregor jumped the fence and confronted Aldo, who was observing the fight from the front row.\n\nThe UFC opted to invest in its first World Tour promotion for the fight, setting up March news conferences for McGregor and Aldo in stops that included Rio de Janeiro, Las Vegas, New York, London and Dublin. McGregor repeatedly promised a first-round knockout. The week of the fight, he said anything after the first four minutes of the bout would be a \"formality.\"\n\nThe fight was scheduled at UFC 189 in July, but Aldo, who fights out of Nova Uniao in Rio, withdrew with a rib injury. McGregor remained on the card and fought three-time title challenger Chad Mendes for the interim belt. He knocked out Mendes in the second round and unified that title with Aldo's on Saturday night.\n\nMcGregor's past five wins have come via knockout. He has not lost since November 2010, when he faced Joseph Duffy, a current UFC lightweight.", "Is this the best the New York Knicks have to offer?": "BOSTON -- Carmelo Anthony walked slowly to the visitors bench with a look of frustration late Sunday night. The Knicks were on their way to losing their fourth straight, 100-91 to the Boston Celtics, and falling four games below .500 for the second time this season.\n\nAnd it didn't seem to sit well with the star forward.\n\n\"I'm happy with the effort we gave, but as far as the losing -- I'm not happy about that,\" Anthony said about an hour after the game.\n\nThe season for the Knicks so far has been filled with stops and starts, but Sunday night felt like a bit of a reality check. New York never really threatened its division rival, save for a late fourth-quarter rally, and seemed a step below in both execution and talent. The loss left the Knicks at 3-13 against teams with records better than .500.\n\nThat, of course, doesn't bode well for a club hoping to sneak into one of the final playoff spots in the Eastern Conference. But that's a discussion for another day.\n\nAaron Afflalo missed 8 of his 10 shots against the Celtics. Brian Babineau/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nMore pressing at the moment is the loss to Boston further exposed some of the Knicks' glaring issues. They include:\n\nInconsistent bench play. New York's reserves missed 18 of 30 shots and were outscored by Boston's bench 44-32. Coach Derek Fisher is still trying to find a unit that can run the offense well. That's one reason he played Sasha Vujacic for 15 minutes Sunday and Jerian Grant did not play.\n\n\"We're still trying to find a way to have five guys that are playing together, flowing together. Sasha obviously has familiarity and history with what we're trying to do offensively,\" Fisher said. \"We continue to search for how to get ourselves organized and we feel like Sasha gave us a chance to do so.\"\n\nSpotty guard play. Jose Calderon had two points on 1-for-3 shooting, with one assist and one turnover in 22 minutes against Boston. Isaiah Thomas had little trouble getting to the basket when guarded by Calderon. Arron Afflalo also had a rough night. He missed 8 of 10 shots and the Knicks were outscored by nine in his 33 minutes on the court.\n\nThe backcourt issues could be addressed via a trade, but the Knicks have been hesitant to make any move that affects their future flexibility. So it may be difficult for the club to acquire an impact player via the trade market.\n\nPorzingis' shot. Kristaps Porzingis\u2019 final line was strong: 16 points, 12 rebounds. But he missed 9 of 13 shots in his 28 minutes. The rookie is shooting just 35 percent in his last five games.\n\n\"I'm getting a lot of looks, and the teammates, they're giving me the ball, they're trusting my shots,\" Porzingis said. \"They know I can make those shots. I'm just not making them. But I can feel it's right there. It's just in-and-out or a little long, little too short. It's right there.\"\n\nOne positive for the Knicks is the players appear to be united amid all of the losing.\n\n\"We have a positive attitude. We just got to figure out ways to pull the game out and win basketball games,\" Anthony said. \"The [positive] attitude is not going anywhere. I won't allow that.\"\n\nAnthony buying in is probably one of the best things the Knicks have going for them right now. If he starts to feel discouraged, it may affect his younger teammates and their approach. But Anthony and the Knicks might also have to get used to what they've seen over the first two months.\n\nNew York doesn't seem to be in position to make any significant changes via the trade market, so this might be the new reality for the Knicks in 2015-16: a team struggling to stay near .500, failing against superior competition and trying to find its way in an improved Eastern Conference.", "Evander Kane of Buffalo Sabres says he's innocent amid sex crime investigation": "BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Sabres forward Evander Kane was calm and brief in saying he looks forward to having his name cleared in connection with a sex crime allegation.\n\n\"I just want to say I've done nothing wrong,\" Kane said Monday morning following Buffalo's pregame skate before hosting the Washington Capitals. \"I respect the legal process. And unfortunately, at this time, there's not much more I can talk about.\"\n\nKane spoke for about 30 seconds in front of a large gathering of reporters in a corner of the Sabres locker room. He did not take any questions in his first comments since The Buffalo News reported that Buffalo police were investigating a claim made against him.\n\nThe alleged incident occurred early Sunday at a downtown hotel, where Kane is living, after he and the Sabres returned to Buffalo following a 6-3 win at Boston. Police issued a statement that was limited to saying no report or charges had been filed.\n\nThe investigation is in its preliminary stages, according to a person with direct knowledge of the details who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Officials are not publicly commenting on the case. The source said police searched Kane's room at the hotel and towed his vehicle, which was described as standard practice in such cases.\n\nKane rejoined his teammates after being given a personal day off Sunday, when coach Dan Bylsma said the Sabres were made aware of the allegation. Bylsma said Kane would be in the lineup against the Capitals.\n\nWithout going into detail, Bylsma said Kane addressed the team before practice. He added that Kane appeared happy to be on the ice with his teammates. Bylsma otherwise declined comment by referring to a statement the team released Sunday.\n\n\"We take the allegation made today against Evander Kane very seriously,\" the Sabres said. \"We are gathering facts and have been in touch with the NHL and Evander's representatives.\"\n\nEvander Kane, who is the subject of a sex crime investigation, will play for the Sabres on Monday night, coach Dan Bylsma said. Dave Reginek/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nKane, who is from North Vancouver, British Columbia, is the second NHL player to be investigated for a sex offense by police in the Buffalo area this year. In November, prosecutors cited a lack of credible evidence after reviewing an allegation against Chicago Blackhawks star Patrick Kane, who was accused of assaulting a woman in August at his offseason home outside Buffalo.\n\nSabres captain Brian Gionta said the allegation against Kane shouldn't be a distraction.\n\n\"It's one of our teammates, obviously, but the bottom line is when we're in this room, we have to worry about hockey,\" Gionta said. \"Lots of things happen, and that's for him to deal with. Part of being a professional is trying to separate things.\"\n\nGionta referred to the team statement when asked how the team will support Kane.\n\n\"It's a serious accusation, but at the same time, that's what it is at this point in time,\" Gionta said. \"And until things change, he's our teammate, and that's about it.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old Kane is in his first full season in Buffalo. He was acquired in a multi-player trade with the Winnipeg Jets in February. He did not play for the Sabres last year because he was recovering from season-ending shoulder surgery.\n\nThis year, the hard-hitting forward has eight goals and five assists in 25 games.\n\nKane is in his seventh NHL season after being selected fourth overall by the then-Atlanta Thrashers in the 2009 draft. He has scored 19 or more goals three times and enjoyed a career-best season in 2011-12, when he recorded 30 goals and 27 assists for 57 points in 74 games.", "Billy Joe Saunders claims first world title in majority decision over middleweight titlist Andy Lee": "Billy Joe Saunders scored a pair of early knockdowns against middleweight titlist Andy Lee on Saturday and avoided Lee's power the rest of the way.\n\nIn a fight largely devoid of action or excitement outside of a wild Round 3, Saunders (23-0, 12 KOs), 26, captured his first world title, winning a majority decision at Manchester Arena in Manchester, England. The judges scored the fight 113-113, 114-112 and 115-111. ESPN.com scored the bout even at 113-113.\n\nBilly Joe Saunders, right, improved to 23-0 and won his first world title by defeating middleweight titlist Andy Lee in a majority decision on Saturday night in Machester, England. Dave Thompson/Getty Images\n\nThanks to Lee's reputation as a dangerous knockout puncher, particularly when he's down on the scorecards, Saunders showed an overwhelming amount of respect throughout. By doing so, Saunders turned the fight into a passive exhibition of southpaws jabbing from distance, which ultimately favored him on the scorecards after building the early lead.\n\n\"[Lee] has been in with Peter Quillin, and [Quillin] couldn't beat him. He has beaten Matt Korobov,\" Saunders said. \"They all had him hurt, but I knew if he threatened me with his power that I have got a good chin.\n\n\"I'm afraid of nobody's power. I'm a world champion. I won't say no to any fights. Andy Lee is a very, very good champion, and I beat a good, sturdy champion because I used his power against him.\"\n\nLee (34-3-1, 24 KOs), who rallied to stop Korobov last December to win a vacant world title, lacked a sense of urgency until the final round. He was content to paw at Saunders with his jab round after round and rarely went to the body.\n\nWhen Lee, 31, did overcommit himself in Round 3, Saunders made him pay by twice scoring a knockdown on a counter right hand.\n\nSaunders scored the first knockdown after Lee missed with an overhand left, catching Lee flush as he pulled back his arm and stood upright.\n\n\"When I was boxing him, he got a little bit careless and dropped his lead hand,\" Saunders said. \"I caught him with a hook.\"\n\nWith Lee hurt, Saunders aggressively pursued and landed a pair of short left hands. He then waited for Lee to miss and landed a three-punch combination, sending Lee down a second time with another right hand.\n\n\"Boom,\" Saunders said of the second knockdown. \"I'm not going to start running my mouth, but it was a good shot. I made him miss.\n\n\"I noticed he carried his lead hand low, and with someone as fast as me, you have got to keep your hands up because it takes two pounds of pressure to knock you down. I'm not the biggest puncher in the world, but I showed you there that I can punch.\"\n\nSaunders and Lee, both English-born fighters, closed the exciting third round by trading punches at close range until the final bell. The exchange reminded Saunders of how dangerous Lee could be, having come from behind against Korobov and John Jackson in consecutive fights in 2014 before rallying to floor Quillin late in their April split draw.\n\n\"I got very excited, but Andy Lee showed that he can be dangerous,\" Saunders said. \"He actually caught me with a shot when I tried to finish him. He didn't hurt me, but I actually got Matt Korobov signs in my head. I learned from Korobov. I fought one rush and then got back to my boxing and recuperated.\"\n\nThe remainder of the fight was contested at a dreadful pace. Lee slowly began to pick up his pressure during the championship rounds and routinely backed Saunders up with left hands in Round 12, but it was too little, too late.\n\n\"I've always said, no disrespect to him, you take the lead hand away from [Lee], and he [will have] been beaten three times,\" Saunders said. \"Some guys just got a little bit careless against him.\"\n\nSaunders, who waited for the Lee fight through a pair of postponements due to injury and illness over the last three months, had previously scored his biggest victory in November 2014 by split decision against British rival Chris Eubank Jr. He now becomes a potential attractive opponent for the division's other titlists to attempt to unify against.\n\nDaniel Jacobs, a secondary titlist fresh off a first-round knockout of Peter Quillin two weeks ago, was a guest analyst for Showtime during Lee-Saunders and reacted to the result.\n\n\"I thought [Lee] was going to be a big brawler, I thought he had better assets,\" Jacobs said. \"He didn't do enough for me. He was too complacent and after the knockdown you didn't see that sense of urgency that a fighter has to have on the comeback trail.\n\n\"All credit due to Billy Joe, but it wasn't an impressive victory.\"\n\nJacobs wasn't yet ready to commit to a unification bout in 2016 with Saunders.\n\n\"We'll do whatever makes sense,\" Jacobs said. \"I think it's time to sit down and figure what makes sense. Obviously it's a good time to be a middleweight champion.\"", "Why Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens finally appear on Jerry Crasnick's Hall of Fame ballot": "Most Hall of Fame voters, historians and fans will remember January 2016 as the crowning achievement for a former prodigy and embodiment of baseball grace. One day we looked up, and Ken Griffey Jr. was 46 years old and ready to glide effortlessly into the gap and stick a Hall of Fame plurality of 98 or 99 percent in his back pocket.\n\nAmid the wall-to-wall Junior love, I'll remember this round of voting as the year I dismounted from my high horse, acknowledged reality and took the plunge on baseball's home run king and a seven-time Cy Young Award winner. Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens won't appear on the stage with Griffey in July. But they're on my 10-man ballot this winter after several years with an empty box beside their names.\n\nScratch a Hall voter, and chances are you'll find variations on three themes. The pragmatists refuse to play \"CSI: Cooperstown\" and pass judgment on a candidate's pharmacological makeup. They go by numbers and numbers alone. The hardliners, in contrast, refrain from voting for anyone with even a whiff of performance-enhancement baggage. When you see the words \"back acne\" in a Hall of Fame column, chances are that a hardliner is crafting it.\n\nEditor's Picks Schoenfield: Trevor Hoffman's Hall of Fame case brings up closer controversy Trevor Hoffman had 601 career saves, second all-time, but is he worthy of the Hall of Fame?\n\nSzymborski: Mussina a casualty of a broken HOF voting process Until a major overhaul of the voting process takes place to make sure players deserving of baseball's highest honor receive it, many of this generation's best players won't make the Hall of Fame. 1 Related\n\nSince steroid use and PED allegations became a factor in Hall balloting, I've tried to walk a more discerning middle ground, judging players case by case and waiting for time to provide some clarity. I believed that clear-eyed detachment would win out in the long run and that the process of culling the real men from the shortcut-takers would become less onerous every year.\n\nThe joke was on me. For all my dilatory tactics, the passage of time has proved clarity is a mirage, and we just alternate between lighter and darker shades of gray.\n\nEven without their turbo-charged ascents into statistical fantasyland, you can make the case Bonds and Clemens were Hall of Famers if they had only quit while they were ahead. In 1998, at age 33, Bonds was a three-time MVP who ranked 34th on The Sporting News' list of 100 greatest players. He had already accumulated a Wins Above Replacement of 94.6 -- more than Al Kaline, Joe DiMaggio, Reggie Jackson and several other outfield greats amassed in their entire careers.\n\nClemens, similarly, laid a strong foundation for the Hall before his improbable second act in Toronto. Through 1996, he had amassed 192 wins and a 3.06 career ERA, capturing three Cy Young Awards with the Boston Red Sox. Cooperstown guru Jay Jaffe rates those achievements as above the Hall of Fame standard for starting pitchers and a \"whisker below\" the numbers posted by Pedro Martinez, who sailed into the baseball shrine last year with 91.1 percent of the vote.\n\nWe know the rest of the story. Barry hitched his wagon to Greg Anderson and Victor Conte, and Roger hooked up with Kirk Radomski and Brian McNamee, and they pushed the envelope into a new and unprecedented WAR zone, marked by cartoon numbers and widespread public scorn.\n\nIs it troubling that Bonds and Clemens were so narcissistic or tone deaf to perception to destroy their legacies? Of course. But they were also a product of their era. And it's delusional to think we, as baseball writers, can uphold some quaint notion of the Hall as a bastion of competitive purity while fans who trek to Cooperstown each summer just want to visit a museum and see the game's history on display with all its complicated messiness.\n\nWhere's the dividing line? Does a prospective Hall of Famer need to flunk a test (Rafael Palmeiro), get misty in front of Bob Costas (Mark McGwire), appear in the New York Times for a positive test result (Sammy Sosa) or earn a mention in the Mitchell report (Gary Sheffield) to be disqualified from consideration? And what about amphetamines? Do we simply wink at that transgression and move on? While debating these and other questions through the years, I've split more hairs than Vidal Sassoon.\n\nLast January, as a social media experiment, I tweeted the question, \"Should Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds be in the Hall of Fame?\" One hour, 1,200 responses and a barrage of \"yes\" votes later, I felt like a guy piling sandbags against a tsunami in my efforts to rationalize my \"no\" vote.\n\nShoulder shrugs are the new clarity. When the Miami Marlins named Bonds their new hitting instructor three weeks ago, the world didn't end. McGwire is the San Diego Padres' bench coach. Sheffield does studio analysis for TBS, and Alex Rodriguez was the feel-good story of 2015 for the New York Yankees. They're all proof that redemption comes with selective memory loss or an .800 OPS, whichever comes first.\n\nThis is a copy of Jerry Crasnick's 2016 Hall of Fame ballot. ESPN\n\nThe mere presence of a plaque in Cooperstown, with or without an asterisk or a designated \"steroid wing,\" can't change the public perception. Dodgers fans are free to regard Bonds as a cheater and a villain, and Giants fans are free to love him for eternity. As Jerry Seinfeld so famously observed, \"You're actually rooting for the clothes when you get right down to it.\"\n\nThe debate will drag on for the foreseeable future. Sheffield and Sosa return to the ballot next year, and Manny Ramirez and Pudge Rodriguez will appear for the first time. Not far down the road, we'll address the same tired questions about David Ortiz, Ryan Braun and A-Rod.\n\nHistory has shown that fans can be even more hypocritical than writers on the topic of Hall worthiness. The same Red Sox diehards who have serenaded A-Rod with chants of \"ster-oids\" will clog the Massachusetts Turnpike on their way to celebrate Big Papi if and when he makes the grade.\n\nThrough the years, a lot of us in the baseball writing community have felt an obligation to safeguard the competitive landscape for posterity. Meanwhile, the Hall of Fame wants the problem to disappear and keeps erecting artificial barriers to force alleged PED users off the ballot. Lots of Hall of Famers don't want cheaters in their midst, and the writers play the role of bouncers in determining admission to the club. And the more we lament the challenges of the task or describe it as a burden, the more fans gag and roll their eyes.\n\nSo I'm ready to declare a moratorium on hand-wringing and cast my ballot, with all its flaws and inconsistencies. Griffey is the certified no-brainer and the first name I checked. I'm voting for Jeff Bagwell and Mike Piazza, who have been dogged by PED whispers of their own, and Tim Raines, who slid into bases headfirst during his heyday in Montreal to protect the cocaine vials in his back pocket. Clemens, Bonds, Trevor Hoffman, Mike Mussina, Curt Schilling and Edgar Martinez round out my list.\n\nMy apologies to Jeff Kent, who made my ballot last year but is a victim of the 10-man limit this time. The same for Billy Wagner and Sheffield, both of whom I considered. I hope they don't fall below the requisite 5 percent cutoff and disappear from the ballot, as Lou Whitaker, Ted Simmons, Mark Grace and other worthy candidates did before their time.\n\nAnd to Alan Trammell, I'm especially sorry. I was hoping to give him a warm sendoff to the Veterans Committee, even though I have yet to check the box beside his name in the past. But I simply ran out of spots.\n\nIn years to come, I reserve the right to make choices based on gut instinct and individual preference. But I'm out of the business of moralizing or parsing distinctions based on real or perceived transgressions. In the case of Bonds and Clemens, I keep going back to the words of ESPN columnist Ian O'Connor, who explained his conflicted Hall of Fame thought process in a 2012 column. \"I'm willing to vote for the bad guys,\" he wrote. \"But only if they're really, really good.\"\n\nAs baseball writers and Hall voters, we're fooling ourselves if we think any of us has a monopoly on truth. We just do the best we can. And in the absence of a better alternative, we make up our own rules as we go along.", "Consistency Ratings from 2013 through 2015": "Last updated: Dec. 29, 2015 (through Week 16)\n\nHow Consistency Ratings Work\n\nUsing fantasy points determined by ESPN's standard scoring, the charts contained in this column rate players based upon how consistently reliable they have been since the beginning of the 2013 season, a span of 50 weeks' worth of games (17 games apiece in 2013 and 2014 and 16 thus far in 2015). For IDPs (individual defensive players), the following scoring is used: solo tackle (1), assisted tackle (0.5), sack (3), interception (3), forced fumble (3), fumble recovery (3), touchdown (6), safety (2), pass defended (1). To familiarize you with some of the terminology and column headers listed in the charts below:\n\nStart%: The player's \"Start Percentage,\" which shows how often he earned your start in an ESPN standard league. This is his number of \"Starts\" -- those defined below -- divided by his number of scheduled team games.\n\nCR: The player's \"Consistency Rating,\" which is calculated as his weekly standard deviation divided by his fantasy points per game average. This is meant to identify the players who were most consistently close to their weekly averages. The lower the number, the more consistent the player. Again, lower numbers are better.\n\nPPR%: The player's Start Percentage using PPR scoring, which uses ESPN's standard scoring settings but adds one point per reception.\n\nFPTS/G: The player's average fantasy points scored per game.\n\nStart: The number of times that the player's point total in a given week was worthy of having had him active in an ESPN standard league.\n\nStud: The number of times the player's point total ranked among the top at his position.\n\nStiff: The number of times the player's point total ranked among the worst at his position, making almost any waiver-wire option a smarter choice.\n\nThese are the benchmarks for what constitutes a \"Start,\" \"Stud\" or \"Stiff\" performance:\n\nConsistency Ratings Benchmarks QB RB WR TE K D/ST DL LB DB Start Top 10 Top 25 Top 25 Top 10 Top 10 Top 10 Top 20 Top 20 Top 20 Stud Top 2 Top 5 Top 5 Top 2 Top 2 Top 2 Top 4 Top 4 Top 4 Stiff 21st+ 51st+ 51st+ 21st+ 21st+ 21st+ 41st+ 41st+ 41st+\n\nSat: The number of times the player missed a game. Players are not charged \"Stiff\" points for sitting out, nor does it impact their overall Consistency Rating (CR), but it hurts their overall Start Percentage (Start%).\n\nPlayers must have at least a 20.0 percent Start Percentage (\"Start%\") in either standard scoring or PPR leagues, or must rank among the top 10 quarterbacks, tight ends or kickers, top 25 running backs or wide receivers, or top 20 defensive linemen, linebackers or defensive backs, in terms of total fantasy points at their position from 2013-15, for inclusion in the chart. All defense/special teams are included, regardless of whether they met those minimums.\n\nQuick click by position:", "Do Race Lotteries Violate the Law?": "The Ironman World Championship currently draws a field of approximately 2,000 racers, most of whom qualify. Ironman reserves 100 non-qualifier spots, which are filled with a lottery. Since 1989, Ironman has charged athletes a fee to enter that lottery. Whether or not athletes were selected to race, they were still charged the lottery fee.\n\nLast year, 12,292 lottery entrants paid a $50 fee; this year, 14,254 did. By holding these lotteries, the World Triathlon Company ran an illegal gambling business, according to the court.\n\nThis ruling could have implications in the running industry. The New York City Marathon, Chicago Marathon, Marine Corps Marathon, Beach to Beacon 10K (in Maine), and Mount Washington Road Race (in New Hampshire) are five well-known events that hold entry lotteries. The Chicago and Marine Corps Marathon lotteries are free to enter, while the New York City Marathon charges a non-refundable $11 fee per entry. Both Beach to Beacon and Mount Washington charge a non-refundable $5 lottery fee per person.\n\nAccording to the Unites States code highlighted in the Ironman complaint, an illegal gambling business involves five or more people, either remains in continuous operation for at least 30 days or has gross revenue of $2,000 in a single day, and violates the law of a state.\n\nAre Race Lotteries Gambling Businesses?\n\nAll five races have lottery field sizes larger than five people, so they meet that criterion.\n\nThe Chicago and New York City Marathon lottery windows both exceed 30 days. The lottery timeframe for the Beach to Beacon and Mount Washington Road Race are both shorter than 30 days. However, those two races could exceed $2,000 gross revenue in a day, depending on how many entries they receive.\n\nBecause the Marine Corps Marathon neither charges for its lottery entries nor operates its lottery for 30 days or more, it cannot be seen as an illegal gambling business.\n\nDo They Violate State Laws?\n\nPrivate lotteries are illegal in every state. To be considered a private lottery, three elements must be present: consideration (that is, a cost to enter), chance, and prize. Based on those requirements, the Chicago Marathon lottery does not qualify as a potentially illegal lottery, said Marc Edelman, a law professor at Baruch College, Zicklin School of Business, in New York, who specializes in gaming law: \u201cNo amount of money is paid to enter the random drawing.\u201d\n\nEdelman noted that very limited transaction fees in certain circumstances have been deemed acceptable, but that just because the New York City Marathon calls its charge a \"processing fee\" does not make it immune to the law. \u201cRequiring an individual to pay $11 to enter a random lottery where the selected winners earn the right of entry into a marathon may reasonably be construed as an illegal lottery because the elements of chance and reward are clearly present and one could make the reasonable argument that the upfront non-refundable payment of $11 in exchange for entry could be construed as consideration,\u201d Edelman said.\n\nThe New York City Marathon is managed by the not-for-profit New York Road Runners. The New York State constitution does make lottery exceptions for non-profits that benefit organizations of veterans, volunteer firefighters, and \u201csimilar groups.\u201d The language is unclear as to whether the NYRR would be included in \u201csimilar groups.\u201d\n\nThe Beach to Beacon and Mount Washington Road Race each charge a lottery fee of $5 per person. \u201cAs the amount of money is reduced, one could make a stronger argument that the payment is merely a processing fee and not an entry fee,\u201d Edelman said. \u201cHowever, charging even a nominal amount of money could lead to a technical challenge of these activities.\u201d", "Roger Federer has 'no plans to retire' after Rio Olympics": "Roger Federer insists he has no plans to retire in 2016 as he targets a bumper medal-haul for Switzerland at next year's Olympics.\n\nThe 17-time Grand Slam champion will celebrate his 35th birthday during the Rio Games, where he has hinted he could bid for a hat trick of golds in the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles tournaments.\n\nDespite maintaining his position as world No.3, Federer has not tasted Grand Slam glory since his last victory at Wimbledon in 2012, but the Swiss veteran claims he will be raring to go at next month's Australian Open.\n\n\"I've planned all of 2016, all the way through the Rio Olympics and beyond,\" Federer said. \"I'm going to probably announce that schedule in the coming weeks. I'm looking forward to next year.\n\n\"Australia's obviously a big goal for me and after that it's going to be a long, tough year. I'm feeling fine physically and in good shape. Like I say so many times, I hope I'm still on tour for a while. There are no plans to retire yet, I don't have a definite date, even though that would make things easier to plan.\"\n\nFederer will be looking to improve on the singles silver he won at London 2012 when the Olympics get underway next summer, while he has also confirmed he will partner with former world No.1 Martina Hingis in the mixed doubles.\n\nHe also hinted he could once again team up with Stan Wawrinka in the doubles, with the duo hoping to replicate the success that saw them take gold at Beijing 2008.\n\n\"Winning the silver at Wimbledon was amazing during the London Olympics,\" Federer said. \"I don't feel like the Rio Olympics necessarily needs to be the singles gold like everybody talks about.\n\n\"That's why I'm going to be playing mixed doubles with Martina Hingis, and I might also play the doubles with Stan Wawrinka. I might enter myself in all three competitions to have the most possible chances to win medals for Switzerland.\n\n\"The Olympics for me is unique. It's about representing Switzerland and making Switzerland proud. I feel the same way on the tour, but the Swiss people can relate more to the Olympics maybe. I carried the flag twice for Switzerland (at Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008) and I got a gold in doubles with Stan so I feel like I accomplished that dream already.\"\n\nFederer, who recently announced he would be parting ways with coach Stefan Edberg after two years of working together, also revealed he still feels the occasional nerves on court, even if playing in smaller matches has become easier with age.\n\n\"In normal matches, maybe a quarterfinal match or first-round match, I don't get so worked up so much any more, where I have knots in my tummy,\" he added. \"But I do still get nervous, I still care very dearly and still have the fire. I think that will never go away until the day is there where I retire and everything drops away.\"", "NHL -- Role of the enforcer is not dead on the San Diego Gulls": "Tim Jackman, Brian McGrattan, Shane O'Brien and Stu Bickel talk about their time as resident tough guys in the NHL and how the game has changed. (2:58)\n\nWhen the Anaheim Ducks sent Tim Jackman to their American Hockey League affiliate on Nov. 2, it was a difficult assignment for the veteran forward, who had been a healthy scratch much of the season before being placed on waivers. But there were some familiar faces that welcomed the longtime enforcer, who led the Ducks in penalty minutes last season despite being limited to 55 games.\n\nThe physical winger felt right at home when he entered the San Diego Gulls' locker room and was greeted by Brian McGrattan, Shane O'Brien and Stu Bickel, three other hard-nosed players who made their bones in the NHL collecting plenty of penalty minutes.\n\nWith the role of enforcer being mostly abandoned by the NHL, these players have found a place with the Gulls. And San Diego's fearsome foursome now makes up one of the most intimidating groups in pro hockey.\n\n\"I've trained with Bicks, we did some boxing one summer trying to prepare for the upcoming season. So we spent some time punching each other in the face,\" said Jackman, 34. \"Me and Shane O'Brien, we used to battle quite a bit when he was in Colorado and I was in Calgary. He plays tough and he slashes and he's kind of dirty. We always went at it.\"\n\nSan Diego doesn't seem like the most likely destination for a tough-as-nails group that has been squeezed out of the NHL game. But here the four enforcers are, and their game certainly hasn't softened now that they've been relegated to the AHL in recent years. Through 22 games, Bickel led the American league with 94 penalty minutes. Through 25 games, McGrattan was eighth with 72 PIMs.\n\nIt's a formidable group in San Diego, one that collected a combined 2,534 penalty minutes in 1,413 NHL games. That combined career total is within striking distance of entire active NHL rosters.\n\n\"I didn't think Jacks was going to be here. That was an added bonus,\" said Bickel, 29. \"I knew what kind of crew it was going to be. It's nice. You don't have to do all the heavy lifting yourself.\"\n\nThe group has made the Gulls a popular draw in their first year in San Diego. But it is also indicative of a game that has seen the designated on-ice security detail mostly eliminated. Each of these veterans has come to terms with the changing face of the NHL, but it has done little to discourage their physical play.\n\nIn San Diego's 3-1 win against the Ontario Reign on Nov. 28, the four longtime enforcers combined for two fights and 34 penalty minutes. Led by McGrattan's 25 minutes, the four-player total was more than Ontario's 27 minutes as a team. Three nights earlier, Bickel's 12 total penalty minutes outpaced the entire Texas Stars roster in a 5-3 loss.\n\nBrian McGrattan knows how to handle himself in a fight, but he has plenty of backup should he ever need it. San Diego Gulls\n\nIt's an element fans aren't likely to find in the NHL. Which makes the Gulls not only something of an anomaly in the changing world of pro hockey, but a throwback to what the NHL was like not that long ago when the likes of McGrattan and O'Brien were plying their trade.\n\n\"It's getting pushed out in the NHL pretty fast,\" said McGrattan, 34. \"That's why a lot of guys are here, but that's life. That's the way it is. It's kind of thriving down here, which is good. It keeps guys employed and we'll see where it goes from here. It's kind of dying off a little bit. We're kind of the last of a generation, so hopefully we can keep it going.\"\n\nThat's a compelling statement coming from McGrattan, who was one of the most intimidating players in the NHL for a decade. His countless NHL battles are well documented, but the young Ducks prospects building their game in San Diego can also track them in McGrattan's numerous scars, tattoos and menacing scowls. The soft-spoken enforcer isn't likely to share his own war stories, but the intimidating presence he still provides speaks volumes.\n\n\"He did it for a long time in the National Hockey League and fought some of the toughest guys that ever played in the NHL. He has that demeanor about him out there,\" said Jackman. \"He has that intimidating factor when he's on the ice and on the bench. He makes everyone feel a little taller.\"\n\nAdd O'Brien, Bickel and now Jackman to the mix, and plenty of opposing AHL players are suddenly coming down with bad cases of the San Diego flu.\n\n\"McGrattan is arguably the toughest guy in the NHL for 10 years,\" said O'Brien, 32. \"Jackman is not scared. Bicks will fight anyone. We have a lot of team toughness. Hopefully the young guys feel a little safer out there. We're not going to get pushed around, that's for sure. If you see a team with a lot of tough guys on it, you know it's going to be a long night.\"\n\nThe group of tenured fighters has come together nicely in San Diego, providing an on-ice bodyguard for some of Anaheim's most prized prospects, most notably Nick Ritchie, Shea Theodore and John Gibson, who was called up to the Ducks in November. That physical veteran core has only grown tougher since Jackman's arrival.\n\nBut there's a certain sense of foreboding to Jackman's assignment. McGrattan, O'Brien and Bickel provided familiar faces, but the three longtime enforcers combined to play 26 NHL games last season. And there hasn't been any indication they will get the call from Anaheim anytime soon.\n\nIt's a sign of a changing NHL: a faster, less physical league that members of the enforcer fraternity have been forced to come to terms with.\n\n\"I don't really think about it. I was blessed to play as long as I did. I was an eighth-round pick. I played over 500 games in almost 10 full seasons in the NHL. The game doesn't owe me anything,\" said O'Brien. \"Obviously we all want to be playing in the NHL, but I have no regrets. I know my situation and I'm playing in a great city with a great group of guys. If Anaheim thinks at some point they need my services, I'll try to be ready to go. But I'm happy and I feel blessed.\"", "Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin says goal against Cleveland Browns is get rid of 'stench' from Week 16 loss": "Stephen A.

Thweatt's time is the seventh-fastest overall by an American in New York. By way of comparison, Shalane Flanagan ran 2:28:40 (for second place) in her debut at the 2010 edition of the race.\n\nThweatt's strong performance was matched on the men's side by Meb Keflezighi, who also finished seventh overall as the first American. Keflezighi's time of 2:13:32 broke the U.S. masters record by 20 seconds.\n\nTeresa McWalters (12th in 2:40:37) and Hilary Corno (2:45:53) were the second and third American women. Craig Leon, eighth in 2:15:56, and Nick Arciniaga, 14th in 2:22:07, were the second and third American men. With the 2016 Olympic Marathon Trials scheduled for Feb. 13 in Los Angeles, most of the top Americans skipped the fall marathon season.\n\nAlana Hadley, the 18-year-old whose 2:38 personal record was the fastest among American women at the start, dropped out after 15K. She lost contact in the first mile with the small group of women that started 30 minutes before the main field, and appeared to be running with a limp before she left the course.\n\nThweatt ran with the leading women through the 30K point. Soon after, eventual winner Mary Keitany dropped the pace significantly and Thweatt was among those who lost contact. She ran alone for most of the rest of the race.\n\n\"It was definitely an extended cross country race for me,\" Thweatt said of the final, hilly stretch in Central Park. \"I definitely had to give it everything I had those last couple of miles. It was brutal.\"\n\nBefore the race, Thweatt told Runner's World that she would not run the Olympic trials in February, even if her debut went well. She said Sunday's success won't change her mind.\n\n\"I'm going to stick to my original plan, which is going to be the track in July [for 10,000 meters at the Olympic track trials],\" she said. \"I'm not a marathoner yet.\"\n\nThweatt's coach, three-time Australian Olympic marathoner Lee Troop, explained his and Thweatt's rationale.\n\n\"I think it would be a huge disservice to her if I had her run the marathon trials,\" Troop said. \"If she made the team, then ran in [the Olympic marathon] in Rio, that would be three marathons in 10 months. That sort of short-term success could shorten her career. She needs to be 14:40, 14:50 for 5,000 [meters] and under 31 [minutes] for 10,000. Then she should have years and years and years for the marathon.\"\n\nUnlike Thweatt, the top two American men on Sunday will run February's marathon trials. Keflezighi, of course, is the defending champion. Leon, who along with Keflezighi led the men on to First Avenue in Manhattan, said, \"a race like this gives me confidence.\"\n\nHe stayed with the leaders until just before the 30K point. \"Putting myself in there, you never know what might happen,\" he said.\n\n\"It happened by accident,\" said Leon, who has a 2:13:52 personal record, of leading the race beside Keflezighi. \"I turned to Meb and said, 'This is a lot of fun.'\"", "'Winning formula' for 2016 Tirreno-Adriatico": "\u2018Winning formula\u2019 for 2016 Tirreno-Adriatico By Gregor Brown\n\nPublished Dec. 21, 2015\n\nA blizzard swept through Italy during the 2015 edition of Tirreno-Adriatico. Photo: Iri Greco / BrakeThrough Media | brakethroughmedia.com\n\nMILAN (VN) \u2014 On a day when RCS Mediagroup confirmed it will keep its races, its subsidiary, RCS Sport, presented its second-biggest stage race after the Giro d\u2019Italia, Tirreno-Adriatico. The seven-stage WorldTour race partly overlaps with Paris-Nice when it begins three days later on March 9 along the Tuscan seaside in Camaiore.\n\nThe race starts and ends with a time trial, features two flat and two rolling stages, and climbs to 1,208 meters (3,963 feet) to finish at Monte San Vicino. Colombian Nairo Quintana (Movistar) won the race this March, when a snowstorm blanketed the Terminillo finishing climb.\n\n\u201cThe last years\u2019 formula is a winner,\u201d said RCS Sport race director Stefano Allocchio. \u201cThe course made of time trials, both team and individual, stages for sprinters, finisseurs, and climbers, give the opportunity to all the athletes to show their best characteristics and, at the end of the seven stages, to crown a complete athlete at the highest possible level.\u201d\n\nRCS Sport\u2019s top brass gathered in Camaiore, hours after its parent publishing house in Milan gave the green light to investment in the Giro and its other races. As news spread that German stage race Bayern Rundfahrt would not continue, due to budget problems, the time was right to be proud of a race that counts 50 editions.\n\nAllocchio referred to the revamped Tirreno that since 2011 ended with an individual time trial instead of a flat sprinters\u2019 stage into San Benedetto \u2014 once a final test for Milano-Sanremo. Top results followed with grand tour heavy-hitters winning the trident trophy: Cadel Evans, Vincenzo Nibali, Alberto Contador, and Quintana in 2015.\n\n\u201cThis race was born as a preparation race for Milano-Sanremo, but over the years, with the great names who\u2019ve raced and won, it has become one of the biggest events on the calendar,\u201d cycling director Mauro Vegni told La Gazzetta dello Sport.\n\n\u201cAnd to help understand, 154 countries receive it on TV, 1.7 million viewers watched the stage to Terminillo this year. And it\u2019s the desire of our company, which RCS CEO Laura Cioli said this morning, to invest more and more in cycling. More investment, more internationalization, cycling is a strategic asset and important.\u201d\n\nTirreno-Adriatico travels west to east, through the Tuscany, Umbria, Abruzzo, and Marche regions, using a proven formula bookended by time trials. The team time trial is back in Camaiore after high winds and downed trees forced the organizer to hold an individual test this March. The second stage covers 200-plus kilometers and ends in Pomarance on a small uphill suited to new world champion Peter Sagan (Tinkoff-Saxo). The third stage to Montalto di Castro could favor an escape that any GC hopeful will have to control for a chance to win the overall.\n\nStages 4 to Foligno and 6 to Cepagatti suit sprinters. If present, Dimension Data\u2019s Tyler Farrar will be able to lead Mark Cavendish in a head-to-head duel with Marcel Kittel (Etixx) and Andr\u00e9 Greipel (Lotto).\n\nThe fifth day stands out with its 13-kilometer climb and 12 percent pitches to reach Monte San Vicino in the Marche region. Who wins the stage, as Quintana did last year in white-out conditions, will likely claim the blue leader\u2019s jersey and defend it in the final 10.05-kilometer time trial in San Benedetto del Tronto.\n\nBMC Racing could send new leader Richie Porte to Paris-Nice and Tejay van Garderen to Tirreno-Adriatico. If so, the American could face stars Contador, Nibali, and defending champion Quintana. RCS Sport will confirm a start list after 2016 gets rolling in January with the Tour Down Under.\n\nFILED UNDER: News TAGS: Tirreno-Adriatico", "Why Golden State Warriors' Klay Thompson is not fantasy's top SG": "Klay Thompson is on fire. In the richest, most NBA Jam-ian form of vernacular.\n\nThompson's averages in the past five games: 30.3 PTS, .548 FG%, .864 FT%, 5.5 3PT, 3.8 REB, 3.3 AST, 1.0 BLK, 0.8 STL.\n\nBy way of celebration, Thompson just self-proclaimed himself the best shooting guard in basketball.\n\nHmmm. Do we agree with Klay Thompson?\n\nDoes his current scoring rampage place him upon the off-ball mountaintop? Has Thompson assumed the mantle of best shooting guard in the NBA?\n\nOr do we agree with ESPN.com's Kevin Pelton? Does Thompson benefit a little too mightily from playing alongside the near mythological Steph Curry? Is there still two-way work to do before taking the top spot at the 2?\n\nLet's focus. Is Thompson the top shooting guard in fantasy?\n\nIn fantasy, the debate can take place from within more myopic boundaries. We can throw out reality-based valuation metrics like real plus minus and win shares and focus on a narrower, geekier bandwidth.\n\nUsing ESPN.com's 2015-16 player rater averages, the top 10 shooting guards currently shake out in this order...\n\nThompson clocks in at ... ninth.\n\nOh.\n\nIt would seem that Thompson is way, way off from being fantasy's top shooting guard.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nFirst off, the shooting guard leaderboard is cluttered with players with multipositional eligibility.\n\nThere are several players up there who just eke out qualifying at SG. (It's a good thing SG eligibility is surrounded by a more forgiving and utopian velvet rope. It's traditionally the thinnest position in fantasy.)\n\nHow many actual true starting NBA shooting guards are we talking about?\n\nThrowing out the Steph Currys and Nicolas Batums, Thompson leaps up the charts to notch fourth.\n\nLet's close our initial debate.\n\nJames Edward Harden is the best shooting guard in basketball. Hands down, case closed, in fantasy and reality.\n\nEven with Harden's attenuated start -- and steep drop-off from his 2015 player rater score of 20.43 -- Harden nearly doubles Klay Thompson's fantasy production. (To put it into perspective, one Harden is the fantasy equal of Thompson and C.J. McCollum.)\n\nHarden outproduces Thompson in points (28.5 to 19.3), free throw percentage (.866 to .853), rebounds (6.2 to 3.5), assists (6.8 to 2.5) and steals (1.8 to 0.6). Thompson wins out in field goal percentage (.473 to .413) and 3-pointers (3.2 to 2.7).\n\nOn paper, Thompson also ranks behind Jimmy Butler (21.5 PTS, .450 FG%, .823 FT%, 1.7 3PT, 5.0 REB, 3.3 AST, 0.9 BLK, 1.8 STL) and even a slumping Brandon Knight (19.7 PTS, .432 FG%, .836 FT%, 2.3 3PT, 4.0 REB, 5.0 AST, 0.4 BLK, 1.5 STL).\n\nTo be fair, given current trajectories, Thompson should overtake Knight for the third spot.\n\nBut here's the thing. Here's why I really brought you here today.\n\nThe 2015-16 version of Klay Thompson isn't even as productive as the 2014-15 version of Klay Thompson.\n\n2014-15 Klay Thompson closed out the campaign with 13.13 player rater points. He finished the season as the second-best true shooting guard in Fantasyland. But this season, Thompson's production is down by 36 percent.\n\nWhen Thompson made his chest-thumping proclamation, perhaps he was thinking of last year's numbers.\n\nBecause 2014-15 Thompson (13.13 PR points) would be in the conversation with 2015-16 Harden (15.13 PR points) for top shooting guard.\n\nThe real question here isn't \"Is Klay Thompson is the top shooting guard in fantasy?\" It's \"Why has Thompson been less productive in 2015-16?\"\n\nIt isn't playing time. Thompson clocks in at 31.7 minutes per game in 2015-16. That's nearly identical to the 31.9 MPG he averaged in 2014-15.\n\nSo why has Thompson's fantasy production taken such a hit?\n\nPart of the answer actually lies in Pelton's rationale. While playing alongside Curry boosts Thompson's real-life NBA r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ... it's been hurting him in fantasy.\n\nCurry is playing at such a Ruthian pace that his gravitational pull is siphoning away Thompson's production.\n\nLet's look at player rater production alongside usage rate and PER.\n\nPlayer Year USG PER PR Stephen Curry 14-15 28.5 28.1 21.3 Stephen Curry 15-16 31.9 33.1 22.2 Klay Thompson 14-15 25.5 20.9 13.1 Klay Thompson 15-16 22.4 18.2 8.4\n\nAnd Curry's not the only Warrior who's taken a leap. Quietly and steadily, Draymond Green has begun to assert himself more on offense. Adding Green to the chart delineates Green's ascendancy --\n\nWhile Curry's and Green's usage rate, PER and player rater production have all spiked, Thompson's numbers have slid.\n\nYou can see the extrapolation of the drop in volume (usage rate) and efficiency (PER) in Thompson's player rater comps --\n\nPlayer Year FG% FT% 3PM REB AST STL BLK PTS 2015 Thompson 14-15 0.64 1.92 4.18 0.16 0.89 1.45 1.14 2.76 13.13 Thompson 15-16 0.86 0.95 3.53 -0.02 0.42 -0.18 0.99 1.9 8.45\n\nAs you can see, Thompson hasn't only dropped in pure scoring production. His rebounding, steals and blocks are also down.\n\nThe Warriors' narrative tends to be laden with 3-point production. But the real story here isn't Thompson's drop in 3-pointers, because looking at Thompson's 3-point metrics across the board, one could argue that he has actually improved from behind the arc.\n\nInstead, take a look at the free throw production.\n\nThompson is down by nearly a full player rater point in free throw production.\n\nRemember, in the player rater, volume of attempts is folded into the free throw metric. So players with fewer attempts will register a lower score, even if their actual free throw percentage holds steady.\n\nThompson is shooting fewer free throws in 2015-16 (2.7 FTA to 3.3 in 2014-15). And he's hitting them with less frequency (.853 FT% to .879).\n\nThis drop is a harbinger of a shooting guard mentality.\n\nAnd it's why shooting guards drive me nuts in fantasy. Shooting guards are to fantasy basketball what wide receivers are to fantasy football.\n\nUnlike quarterbacks and point guards, wide receivers and shooting guards have to be fed touches. If they don't get fed, their raison d'\u00eatre hits an existential pothole.\n\nIf you mosey on over to Basketball-Reference.com, you'll see further evidence in Thompson's 2-point production.\n\nThompson's 2-point attempts per 100 possessions are down from 15.0 to 11.0. I think this has as much to do with Green as it does Curry. Curry's 2-point attempts have held steady at 13.0. But Green's 2-point attempts have gone from 8.6 to 10.2.\n\nIn 2014-15, 58 percent of Thompson's field goal attempts were from 2-point range. In 2015-16, it's down to 50 percent. And that's more telling than you think, when you consider the shooting guard mentality.\n\nIt's not just the decrease in less efficient jump shots. The biggest single drop in Thompson's 2-point production has been from 0 to 3 feet. As in layups. As in drives to the basket.\n\nThompson isn't getting to take the ball to the hoop the way he did in 2014-15. He's getting fewer layups, which translates to fewer fouls, which translates to fewer free throw attempts.\n\nShooting guards tend to need the ball in their hands to be productive. When they're fed fewer touches on offense, numbers start to drop across the board. Statistical fissures pop up in odd places. Rebounds drop. Steals divot.\n\nWhat we have here, dear reader ... is a numerically pouty shooting guard.\n\nLook at Thompson's big night last night against the Bucks. His shot chart reflects an uptick from 0 to 3 feet. BasketballReference.com\n\nThompson was more aggressive with the ball, and it translated at the free throw line. Thompson scored 27 points but was only 2-for-9 from downtown. The key was getting to the line. Thompson was 9-for-10 from the free throw line, his second-best free throw performance of the season and only the second time he's gotten to double digits in free throw attempts.\n\nThompson's recent trash talk is fine. No; it's good. Thompson is known for being somewhat shy, which is atypical for a 2-guard.\n\nYou want your shooting guard to experience constant bouts of delusional overconfidence. To achieve peak production, Thompson needs to be a true shooting guard with a true shooting guard mentality.\n\nWhich will, coincidentally, lead him to make the occasional irrational pronunciation about being the best in the NBA.\n\nLook at what Thompson's registered over his past five games. It's a genuine breakout. Thompson's mojo is working. He's reverting to his gangbusters 2014-15 form.\n\nWhich should ... make him a mortal lock for fantasy's second-best shooting guard.", "New York City Marathon -- Kenya's Stanley Biwott, Mary Keitany win titles": "Stanley Biwott recaps winning the New York City Marathon for his first major marathon title.

Off the field, the fireballer's fate remains to be determined.\n\nYankees assuming major risk -- and sending wrong message -- in acquiring Chapman Keith Law likes what the Yanks bullpen could look like with Aroldis Chapman anchoring it but doesn't like the message the team sends in acquiring him. 2 Related\n\nThe Reds, who have shed several veterans in the past six months, get right-handers Caleb Cotham and Rookie Davis and infielders Eric Jagielo and Tony Renda from New York.\n\n\"We felt this was an opportunity for us to add a big arm to our bullpen,\" said Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, who already had flamethrowers Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller at the back end of his bullpen.\n\nIf the Yankees keep all three, they would be the first team in MLB history to feature three pitchers who had at least 100 strikeouts in relief the season before, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nThe addition of Chapman sets up the possibility of a lockdown bullpen that can effectively shorten games to six innings, thereby reducing the demands on the Yankees' aging and shaky starting rotation.\n\nBut trading for Chapman comes with a real element of risk. A baseball source with knowledge of the situation told ESPN's Wallace Matthews that the Yankees made the trade knowing that both Florida law enforcement officials and Major League Baseball are continuing to investigate the Oct. 30 incident in which Chapman allegedly choked his girlfriend and then fired eight shots from a handgun in the garage of his Davie, Florida, home.\n\nThe source said the Yankees believe that Chapman, who was not charged with domestic violence because of insufficient evidence, might still be suspended by MLB for up to 45 days in connection with the gun incident.\n\n\"That was the risk they were willing to take,\" said the source, who requested anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. \"If he has to sit out the first 30 or 45 days, [the Yankees] felt he was worth it.\"\n\nThis year, Aroldis Chapman threw the 62 fastest pitches in the big leagues, which ranged from 102.36 mph to 103.92 mph, according to MLB's Statcast computer system. Charles LeClaire/USA TODAY Sports\n\nChapman became available after the Reds' deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers fell through three weeks ago during baseball's winter meetings, when news broke that Florida police investigated the accusation of domestic violence involving the Cuban left-hander.\n\nAccording to a police report obtained by ESPN, Chapman's girlfriend accused him of pushing and choking her during a verbal altercation that began after she \"found something on his phone that she did not like.\" Chapman told police he poked the woman on the shoulder and she fell to the ground.\n\nMore than a dozen police officers responded Oct. 30 to Chapman's home in Florida. No arrests were made because stories conflicted and witnesses failed to cooperate. The investigation was closed pending new evidence, according to the police report. After reports of the incident surfaced, the district attorney's office said it was still investigating.\n\nMLB has indicated it will take as long as necessary to thoroughly vet the matter. The league also is investigating domestic violence incidents involving Colorado's Jose Reyes and the Dodgers' Yasiel Puig.\n\nFor It's 1, 2, 3 Strikes, You're Out ...

The past season, he threw the 62 fastest pitches in the big leagues that ranged from 102.36 mph to 103.92 mph, according to Major League Baseball's Statcast computer system.\n\nSince his 2010 debut, Chapman has thrown 1,694 pitches at 100 mph or faster. The Royals' Kelvin Herrera is No. 2 on that list with just 532.\n\nSince defecting from Cuba in 2009, Chapman has spent the past six seasons with the Reds. In that time, he saved 146 games in 164 chances. He had a 1.63 ERA this year, when he struck out 116 in 66 1/3 innings. He was an All-Star in each of the past four seasons.\n\nWith the Reds undergoing a major retooling after a 98-loss season, Chapman joined Cincinnati stars Johnny Cueto, Todd Frazier and Mike Leake, who all have been dealt since July.

Remove people with doping knowledge or a questionable history, the argument goes, and you're removing potential enablers. It would show the current generation that there is no post-retirement director's seat waiting if they stray down the wrong path, too.\n\nBut could such a policy ever be implemented across the entire sport, or even within the UCI itself? Is it even a good idea? Legal issues abound, and a strong counter-argument exists: Zero tolerance merely supports the decades-old cycling omerta, encouraging silence. And the riders of the 1990s and 2000s are now deeply enmeshed in the management side of the sport, perhaps irreversibly so.\n\n\"I think if we're 100 percent honest about it, I don't think we could run men's pro road racing without some people who at some stage in their career had some contact with doping,\" said UCI president Brian Cookson, speaking with VeloNews in his office in Aigle, Switzerland. \"To pretend that we can is a delusion, really.\"\n\nBeyond the moral questions, there are both pragmatic and legal issues. How many pro team sport directors or members of team management would survive such a purge? How is \"fit and proper\" even defined, if we were to extend it beyond those with WADA lifetime bans? Would such a definition hold up in court?\n\nEditor's Picks Doping-tainted Astana team keeps top-tier status The doping-tainted Astana cycling team will keep its top-tier racing status next season.\n\nFord: Is IAAF's decision just more bureaucratic theater? The IAAF took its stand on Friday with a provisional suspension against Russia. Will the move amount to anything more? Signs, and history, point to no. 1 Related\n\nAs major organizations like USA Cycling trend toward zero-tolerance policies, following in the footsteps of teams like Sky, what to do with the sport's tainted human capital is a fundamental debate.\n\n\"This is a very complex issue,\" Cookson said. \"People would just think you say, 'Get him or her out of the sport because they did X, Y, or Z.' It isn't that simple.\"\n\nHe's absolutely right. Toughening up the definition of who can work in cycling, beyond what is currently in place, sits on tenuous legal ground -- WADA and the UCI already bar individuals serving lifetime bans.\n\n\"Let's take Bjarne Riis. Anti-Doping Denmark performed a long-term investigation into him and have not been able to take any action against him,\" Cookson said. \"All his admitted offenses are outside the statute of limitations. It's very difficult to penalize or sanction somebody for something that is outside of that period because then inevitably that person challenges it. We have to take action that is legally defensible.\"\n\nA second penalization for the same offense runs contrary to the concept of double jeopardy, present in most legal systems throughout the world. If an individual has served his or her ban for a given offense, that person cannot be penalized again for the same offense.\n\nIf all doping offenses resulted in lifetime bans, keeping former dopers out of cycling would not be an issue. But that's not the case, and since it's now clear that most former dopers and enablers were never caught or sanctioned at all, the law gets in the way of pushing such individuals out.\n\nThat may not be a bad thing, according to Cookson.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who made bad decisions and bad judgments, and I don't defend them, but I think you have to allow them the possibility of redemption, as well,\" Cookson said. \"I almost hate hearing myself say those words, because I would love to say, 'You know what? If you're a doper, you're out,' but actually implementing that is very, very difficult.\n\n\"To be realistic about it, and I think we haven't got the right answer yet, we have to find ways of making assessments about people's genuine contrition and ... whether they are deserving of redemption or not.\"\n\nThe Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) was a step in that direction, according to Cookson. It wasn't the truth and reconciliation commission many hoped for (Cookson says such a commission would be impossible under EU law) but it was a document of record. If not a record of who did what, at least of what happened.\n\nA sport-wide zero-tolerance policy isn't possible. But there are steps that can be made in that direction, as the law allows.\n\n\"We're looking at all the ways that we can tighten up those things, fit in proper person tests and so on, but what we always have to do is make sure that anything we do is legally defensible,\" Cookson said. \"I don't mind spending money on lawyers if we're going to win, but I don't want to spend money on lawyers and lose.\"", "Notes: Gold medalists Zou, Murata top doubleheader": "A few notes from around the boxing world:\n\nChinese flyweight star Zou Shiming, the two-time Olympic gold medalist, who is scheduled to return Jan. 30 in Shanghai following surgery on a torn rotator cuff, now has an opponent for the 10-round bout: Natan Coutinho (12-0, 10 KOs), 21, of Brazil, whose record has been built against woeful opposition who have a combined record of 48-178-2. Zou (6-1, 1 KO), 34, injured his shoulder during a March 7 unanimous-decision loss challenging flyweight titleholder Amnat Ruenroeng of Thailand in Macau, China. According to Top Rank, the card will also include 2012 Japanese Olympic gold medalist Ryota Murata (8-0, 5 KOs), 29, in the 10-round middleweight co-feature against Juan Camilo Novoa (25-6-1, 23 KOs), 34, of Colombia. Novoa has won three fights in a row since a sixth-round knockout loss to Dmitry Chudinov in an interim middleweight title bout in December 2013.\n\nAlthough Erkan Teper\u2019s first-round knockout of David Price, 32, of England, to win the vacant European heavyweight title took place on July 17 in Germany, reports have just come out in the German media that Teper, 33, of Germany, failed his post-fight drug test and that the German Boxing Federation fined and suspended him for two years on Dec. 9. The delay before the suspension was handed down was reportedly caused by the fact that Teper did not respond to a letter asking him if he wanted his \u201cB\u201d sample tested after the \u201cA\u201d sample tested positive. This is reportedly Teper\u2019s second failed drug test in 2 years. The victory will be changed to a no contest, meaning Price\u2019s record is 19-2 with 16 KOs and the no contest, while Teper\u2019s record is revised to 14-0 with nine knockouts and a no contest. Teper was supposed to make his first defense against Robert Helenius last Saturday but pulled out, supposedly with an injury, and the title was vacated. It would seem clear that the real reason the fight was called off was Teper\u2019s previously unreported suspension. Helenius (22-0, 19 KOs) wound up facing Franz Rill (11-1, 7 KOs) for the vacant European title on Saturday and won a unanimous decision.", "UCI president Brian Cookson discusses recent WorldTour reforms": "Editor's note: This Q&A originally appeared at VeloNews.com\n\nIn the debate over cycling's impending WorldTour reform, Tour de France owner ASO stands quite alone.\n\nThough the broad discussion about cycling's future is full of smaller quarrels, and stakeholders make different allies in each individual fight, there remains a distinct line between ASO and others: the UCI, tour teams, and even fellow race organizers.\n\n\"Whilst one group of organizers -- I won't beat around the bush, it's ASO -- seem to be a little bit unhappy, and I'm quite puzzled by their position, the majority of the rest of the WorldTour organizers are pretty happy,\" UCI president Brian Cookson said of the recently approved reform package.\n\n\"I've spoken with the guys from Flanders Classics, and Tour de Suisse, [Giro d'Italia organizer] RCS, just to name a few, and they're very supportive of where we're going,\" he said.\n\nA final compromise between the sides came out of this week's discussions in Barcelona: The UCI and teams won an important victory in the evolution of WorldTour license to three-year guarantees, but the sport of cycling will not see any of the other major changes discussed since the end of previous president Pat McQuaid's tenure.\n\nVeloNews called President Cookson on Wednesday morning to ask what exactly happened in Barcelona? Is this a reform at all? Does ASO hold too much power?\n\nThe following is a transcript of that conversation, edited only slightly for clarity.\n\nVeloNews: Most of the proposals we've seen over the last three years were not passed. Is this reform, or just a reconfirmation of what cycling already is?\n\nBrian Cookson: I think what's happened is that the proposals that were part of the 2013 reforms that I inherited, it became pretty clear quite early on that these were not proposals that had universal or even widespread support, either amongst the organizers or amongst the teams. When bits of those proposals got out into the public domain the fans weren't particularly happy about it, either.\n\nSo what we've done over the last two years is revisit all of it. Really try to see what the issues are; what can we do to move things forward. Clearly, our view was that the 2013 proposals were trying to fit cycling into a kind of straitjacket that might work for other sports but might have been damaging to our sport.\n\nWe've come up with a range of proposals that are an evolution, not a revolution.\n\nWe're not insisting there are no overlaps in the calendar; we are making sure that there aren't more than two races at a time.\n\nWe're not looking at forcing events to reduce the number of days. If you recall, the original proposal was to bring the calendar down to 120 days [of racing], so events like the Vuelta would lose a week. They weren't very happy about that.\n\nThere are other events, like the Tour of Turkey, that would love to be part of the WorldTour and have a legitimate claim to be so.\n\nThis idea of the best riders in the best events all the time will never work for our sport. That's a misunderstanding. The best riders for the classics are not the best riders for the grand tours. We'd love to see Tour de France riders in Paris-Roubaix, but the idea that you can force riders, in the modern era, to ride races that don't suit them and don't suit their preparation just doesn't work.\n\nI think we've come up with something that will move things forward very positively. So the teams will get a strong basis, they'll have a three-year license provided they comply with the requirements. The races will also have three-year licenses as well.\n\nForcing all top riders to take part in cobbled one-day classics like Paris-Roubaix is not an option for the UCI, says president Brian Cookson. Bryn Lennon/Getty Images\n\nThe teams won't be forced to reduce their numbers, so nobody will be thrown out of a job because of these proposals. There will be a development team as part of each team as well, so that will manage the process of bringing new riders into the WorldTour and developing them with the right sort of guidance.\n\nI think, when I look around the room at the proposals, it seemed to me that the majority of people believed these will be good proposals that will be workable. If we had not changed our proposals, there would have been no point in having these additional discussions.\n\nVN: There were still points of contention leading into Barcelona. What were they?\n\nBC: Well, no one until we did the presentations and discussions at the start of the seminar, nobody had a clear picture of all of the proposals, and how they balanced out, and how they would work. That was helpful from everyone's point of view.\n\nIt's no secret that one group of the organizers were less than happy about the direction of things. But actually, if you talk to other groups of organizers, the WorldTour organizers, you'll find that they're pretty happy.\n\nSo whilst one group of organizers -- I won't beat around the bush, it's ASO -- seem to be a little bit unhappy, and I'm quite puzzled by their position, actually, the majority of the rest of the WorldTour organizers are pretty happy. As are those organizers who think they might have an opportunity to get into the WorldTour.\n\nSo we put in place a process where any event that wants to be considered for the WorldTour in 2017 will be assessed during 2016. It will obviously have to be a 2.1 or 1.1, those kinds of level events can be considered and assessed and appraised. There is some limited room around the existing WorldTour events to put in some extra events, provided we don't impose a no-overlap rule, which was causing problems for existing events.\n\nIf we don't restrict the number of riders in a team, in the overall team, we leave the teams up to 30 riders, then they can run at least two teams at any one time. We're not talking about new events that those teams are not riding already; we're talking about good quality events that are just outside the WorldTour at the moment, bringing them inside.\n\nIn that way, we can start to take the WorldTour more generally around the world.\n\nVN: So is the ASO unduly influencing this debate?\n\nBC: I'm not going to cast aspersions on the ASO. What I will say is that I don't believe that AIOCC had a balanced picture of the reforms when it took that vote. I know that many organizers are quite pleased with the proposals. All I can say is speak to them. See what they have to say. I think you'll find there is quite a lot of support among organizers.\n\nTour de France organizers were forced to stop this year's race after a big crash, and are also trying to put the brakes on certain UCI reforms. Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOne understands why ASO would be a little bit protective of their assets. They've done a great job with what they have and they don't want to weaken their position. But my view is that the role of the UCI is to work in the interest of all stakeholders, not just one. Our job is to develop and enhance the sport around the world, and I think these proposals will do that.\n\nI don't want to fall out with ASO or anyone else, I want them to keep talking to us and I'm sure that these proposals will enhance everybody's position if we give them a chance to breathe and develop.\n\nVN: Was the three-year license deal, which the ASO has opposed, a victory for the UCI and teams?\n\nI don't like to talk in terms of victory and defeat. What we're trying to do is find balanced solutions that are in everyone's best interest, that strengthen the economic position of our sport. It's a professional sport, so it needs to be based on a strong economy.\n\nThe teams now have the possibility of a three-year license; they'll still have to go under annual scrutiny. We'll have sporting appraisal at the end of three years, and with those sporting criteria we'll look at moving teams in or out.\n\nBut that's just one of the elements. The teams have only as much stability as the organizers have. They have a commitment for three years; the organizers will have the same. They can predict and plan ahead, and now the teams can do the same. I think that's good for the sport.\n\nIf we were in a position where we had 18 WorldTour teams that were sound and another 10 Pro Continental teams that were so well-funded that they were desperate to get into the WorldTour, then we'd look into the assessments, the promotion and relegation possibilities and so on, but we're not there yet. I want us to get there over the fullness of time. To do that we need to allow things to develop incrementally and in a sustainable way.\n\nVN: Anything you want to add?\n\nBC: I think it's fair to say that I'm a little bit puzzled by ASO's position. No objections were raised at the end of our discussion sessions. We gave everybody a lot of opportunity to come back. If we don't have dialogue then we're not going to move forward.\n\nAs I said, if you talk to other organizers, if you talk to teams, I think there's pretty strong consensus around these proposals. Maybe they're not dramatic or radical, but I believe they'll work for our sport. Our sport isn't tennis or football or golf, it's not Formula One, it's got to be something that works for our sport, that respects that heritage that we all fell in love with. We need to develop, and spread it around the world if we can, without damaging any of the wonderful features of our sport.", "Arizona Cardinals have a clear case as the best team in the league": "Cardinals defense records nine sacks and scores two touchdown to earn the team's game ball, while Packers DT Mike Daniels receives a game ball for his second quarter interception. (1:25)\n\nGLENDALE, Ariz. -- An argument can be made following the Arizona Cardinals' 38-8 blowout of the Green Bay Packers on Sunday that the Cardinals are the best team in the NFL.\n\nThat could be selling them short. In reality, the same argument could have been made last week after a somewhat similar 40-17 blowout of the Philadelphia Eagles. The Carolina Panthers may have the best record in the NFL, but the Cardinals have the best numbers in football, and the eye test isn't making those numbers look the least bit questionable.\n\nThanks to the 38-point effort against the Packers, the Cardinals jumped ahead of the Panthers -- who lost to Atlanta, 20-13 -- in offensive scoring at an average of 32.2 points a game. The Panthers dropped to 30.8. The Cardinals are also tied for fourth in the NFL with Denver for fourth place in fewest points allowed at 18.5. (The Panthers are eighth at 19.9.) Add it up, and you have a team well ahead of the league in point differential.\n\nIf you go back to last week, the Cardinals entered Week 16 on the ESPN Football Power Index as No. 1 by a full point at 9.9 (6.9 on offense, 3.3 on defense and minus-0.3 on special teams). Seattle was second at 8.9, the New England Patriots third at 8.5 and the Panthers a distant fourth a 7.3. The Seahawks, Patriots, Panthers and Pittsburgh Steelers, who ranked fifth last week, all lost. When you have the best offense in football and are in close contention for the best defense, you're in, at worst, a close race for the best team, period.\n\nSo this can be said: The Cardinals might not finish the season with the best record, but they are finishing the season as the most complete team, and that alone sets them atop the field. And Carson Palmer might be a few votes behind Cam Newton and Tom Brady for MVP, but the gap isn't huge. Palmer is loaded with offensive weapons -- wide receiver John Brown is within 42 yards of joining Larry Fitzgerald (1,160) in the 1,000-yard receiving club; Michael Floyd is a great No. 2 receiver with 51 catches for 833 yards -- and he has been exceptional, well ahead of the pack in QBR.\n\nMatt Kartozian/USA TODAY Sports\n\nAnd while many numbers might back up the Cardinals, so does history. People might have forgotten the Cardinals were equally as good last year before Palmer suffered an ACL tear and was lost for the season. They were 9-1 and on a similar roll. The Panthers at that time were feeling their way through a 3-8-1 start.\n\nThe Panthers finished strong with four wins. The Cardinals largely fell apart, despite a brief visit to the postseason. That drop off might be the education that could get the Cardinals to the Super Bowl.\n\nHead coach Bruce Arians set the goal to earn a playoff bye, which would mean getting the No. 1 or No. 2 seed. Mission accomplished.\n\n\"Our goal was to learn from the 9-1 situation we had last year,\" Arians said. \"We did not play well enough to win. We need to learn how to play well enough to win and we still really haven't done anything other than get a bye. You don't get rings for byes; you only get T-shirts and hats.\"\n\nThis team has more than that. They have the feel of a championship team. A lot of that has to do with Arians' coaching and general manager Steve Keim's ability to fill out a championship roster.\n\nPackers fans were in full voice in Arizona on Sunday -- Green Bay will always travel well -- and the team was coming off a big win, but the Packers weren't able to compete. Despite the season-ending loss of defensive back Tyrann Mathieu and the temporary loss of safety Rashad Johnson, the Cardinals' defense stifled the Packers. Aaron Rodgers was battered from every angle. Even veteran Dwight Freeney sacked Rodgers three times. Calais Campbell had 2.5 for himself. Overall, the Cardinals had nine sacks against the Packers, eight on Rodgers, who threw for only 81 net yards passing.\n\nCarson Palmer leads the NFL in Total QBR this season behind a potent deep passing game. Norm Hall/Getty Images\n\nArians was asked if this year's team is better than last year's.\n\n\"This one,\" Arians said. \"This one because they've learned their lessons.\"\n\nHe went on to say the Cardinals tightened up down the stretch last year and didn't play well to win in the playoffs or in a championship game.\n\n\"Now, we've learned how to win those games this year and it should continue into the playoffs,\" Arians said.\n\nIt didn't hurt that Keim brought in veteran players who know how to win. Halfback Chris Johnson filled in admirably in the backfield after rookie David Johnson was hurt in the preseason. Johnson took control of the running game after the other Johnson went on injured reserve, and Andre Ellington fought through nagging injuries that kept him sidelined. Arians says he believes David Johnson has the talent to be a special back.\n\nFreeney improved the team's pass rush immensely. He was seven days from giving up on the season and his career until Arians called him and asked if he was ready to get off the couch. Freeney has seven sacks in 10 games and has earned $500,000 in incentives. And Freeney is impressed.\n\n\"I would say definitely this is the most talent I've been around,\" Freeney said. \"Corners, safeties, linebackers, the defensive line front, it's definitely up there. Some of the reasons I came back was to play with those types of guys and just have that feeling of dominating, dominating defense. I think we are in the top five in a lot of categories. I've never been on a defense that has so many top fives -- against the run, against the pass, total defense. I love playing with these guys.\"\n\nThe Panthers dominated the Pro Bowl voting, leading the league with 10. The 14-0 start obviously helped. The Panthers earned every honor, but the Cardinals are finishing stronger. The numbers back them as football's best right now, and it's not hard to see why.\n\nPittsburgh's loss to Baltimore put a dent in the Steelers' playoff hopes. Now the Jets must lose in Week 17 for the Steelers to have a shot. AP Photo/Patrick Semansky\n\n-- The biggest losers of the day were the Pittsburgh Steelers. By losing to Ryan Mallett and the Baltimore Ravens, the Steelers now lose the AFC wild-card tiebreaker to the New York Jets, who will make the playoffs if they win next week at Buffalo. Even though NBC wisely flexed this game out of prime time and into the early afternoon, Ravens vs. Steelers remains the current best rivalry in football.\n\n-- The easiest thing to figure out Sunday was how the game against the Jets was a trap for the New England Patriots. Tom Brady didn't have Julian Edelman or Danny Amendola. Bill Belichick was trying to resurrect a running attack with Steven Jackson, who had only seven carries and 15 yards. The already-thin offensive line lost tackle Sebastian Vollmer to a potential bad leg injury. The Patriots will rebound.\n\n-- As much as the NFC wild-card teams might be angling to play the Washington Redskins, the Green Bay Packers might also be attractive. The wide receiver corps continues to lack separation from opposing cornerbacks. The offensive line has been down as many as three starters because of injuries and is running out of gas. Aaron Rodgers doesn't look comfortable. The Packers could have a tough time against the Minnesota Vikings next week.\n\n-- Give Johnny Manziel credit for his tenacity in a 17-13 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. You could tell he was tiring in the fourth quarter after a few potential scoring drives. The television cameras caught him looking fatigued in the 21-play drive in the fourth quarter. I still think he will be traded because he's not going to get enough points out of this offense to win, and I believe the Cleveland Browns will draft a quarterback.\n\n-- It's pretty simple why the St. Louis Rams swept the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks' offensive line doesn't match up well against the Rams' defensive line and their pass rush. That is something the team will have to figure out in the offseason, but the Seahawks are still in the playoffs and are dangerous.\n\n-- As beat up as Matt Hasselbeck is and was in the past couple of weeks, it would be advisable for him to retire at age 40. He tried his best to help the Indianapolis Colts. He went 5-3 filling in for Andrew Luck and put the Colts in position to beat the Miami Dolphins, 18-12, on Sunday. He suffered a partial shoulder separation and will probably sit out the finale.\n\n-- Speaking of the Dolphins, that was the seventh game in which the team scored 15 points or fewer. Considering the talent at receiver and Ryan Tannehill's skills, that's unbelievably bad.\n\n-- Brandon Weeden got the best of Zach Mettenberger in the Houston Texans' 34-7 blowout of the Tennessee Titans on Sunday. The Texans have all but clinched the AFC South. It might be time to start wondering about Mettenberger. He's 0-9 in starts and has scored 27 total points in his past four.\n\n-- Home teams went 10-3 Sunday, but it was about time. For the season, the home team has a 128-111 record. The .536 winning percentage at home is the worst since 2006 and 1986, when it was .531.\n\n-- The NFC finished 35-29 against the AFC in interconference play.\n\n-- As for the bad divisions, the AFC South finished 13-27 in non-division games and the NFC East finished 14-26.\n\n-- DeAngelo Williams of the Steelers and Tim Hightower of the New Orleans Saints and Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings were the only backs with 100-yard games in Week 16. It has been a horrible year for running back stats. Only eight backs are expected to have 1,000-yard seasons this year. Williams, LeSean McCoy and Frank Gore would each need 100-plus-yard games to get to 1,000. Only four backs currently have 1,000-yard seasons.", "Canelo Alvarez stops James Kirkland": "This past May, Canelo Alvarez left the crowd in Houston's Minute Maid Park in amazement after punching James Kirkland into the ropes for a knockout in the third round. (1:33)\n\nOn May 2, as all boxing fans know, Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao laid a giant egg in their much-ballyhooed megafight, one that generated a record-slaughtering $600 million or so at the box office but little excitement or drama between the ropes.\n\nRafael's Knockouts of the Year 2015: Canelo Alvarez KO3 James Kirkland\n\n2014: Wladimir Klitschko KO5 Kubrat Pulev\n\n2013: Adonis Stevenson TKO1 Chad Dawson\n\n2012: Juan Manuel Marquez KO6 Manny Pacquiao IV\n\n2011: Nonito Donaire TKO2 Fernando Montiel\n\n2010: Sergio Martinez KO2 Paul Williams II\n\n2009: Manny Pacquiao KO2 Ricky Hatton\n\n2008: Edison Miranda KO3 David Banks\n\n2007: Darnell Wilson KO11 Emmanuel Nwodo\n\n2006: Calvin Brock KO6 Zuri Lawrence\n\n2005: Allan Green KO1 Jaidon Codrington\n\n2004: Antonio Tarver KO2 Roy Jones Jr. II\n\n2003: Rocky Juarez KO10 Antonio \"Chelo\" Diaz\n\n2002: Roy Jones KO7 Glen Kelly\n\n2001: Lennox Lewis KO4 Hasim Rahman II\n\n2000: Lennox Lewis TKO2 Francois Botha\n\nThe sport of boxing suffered from that hangover for much of the rest of the year. However, a brief respite came one week later, on May 9, when Canelo Alvarez, one of boxing's biggest stars, and power brawler James Kirkland met at 155 pounds in front of a wild, pro-Alvarez crowd of 31,588 at Minute Maid Park in Houston.\n\nThey delivered an action-packed slugfest that ended in violent fashion, with Alvarez annihilating Kirkland with one thunderous right hand for the 2015 ESPN.com knockout of the year.\n\nKirkland, already dropped in the first round, went down again on the end of a pinpoint right uppercut with about a minute remaining in the third. After the bloodied Kirkland beat the count, referee Jon Schorle told him, \"Show me something.\" But Kirkland had nothing left.\n\nAlvarez went right at him and backed him into the ropes before dropping the hammer. He touched Kirkland to the stomach with a left jab and followed with a devastating right hand to the jaw that connected flush, spun Kirkland halfway around into the ropes and sent him crashing to the canvas, his arms over his head, his eyes closed and blood visible inside his open mouth and smeared on his face. Schorle immediately waved off the fight at 2 minutes, 19 seconds.\n\nEditor's Picks Fighter of the year: Canelo Alvarez Canelo Alvarez showed in 2015 why he's one of the best fighters in the ring, highlighted by his victory over lineal middleweight champion and future Hall of Famer Miguel Cotto.\n\n\"There's a perfect straight right hand, and Schorle's gonna stop the fight,\" HBO's Hall of Fame broadcaster Jim Lampley exclaimed. \"What a performance by Canelo Alvarez.\"\n\nMedical personnel rushed to Kirkland's side as Alvarez, who with the victory had blasted his way into a Nov. 21 middleweight world title shot against Miguel Cotto, bent over his fallen foe to make sure he was OK. Kirkland went to the hospital for precautionary reasons, and Alvarez savored his big win that was punctuated by a sensational knockout.\n\n\"I'm happy about the win,\" Alvarez said matter-of-factly. \"The result was what I expected.\"\n\nOther sweet shots:\n\n2. Mairis Briedis KO5 Manuel Charr (Aug. 22 at Grozny, Russia)\n\nUnbeaten heavyweight Mairis Briedis scored a memorable knockout by drilling former title challenger Manuel Charr. Courtesy Main Events\n\nBriedis, an unbeaten heavyweight, took on his first legitimate opponent in ex-title challenger Charr and absolutely ruined him by spectacular knockout. In the waning seconds of the fifth round, Briedis landed a clean right uppercut on Charr's chin, instantly turning out his lights. But Briedis continued with his combination, crushing Charr with a left hook to the jaw that sent Charr crashing face first. Already unconscious, Charr was unable to break his fall and landed hard on the bottom rope. His limp body was draped over the rope, half inside the ring, half on the apron, with his hands at his side as referee Irakly Malazonia immediately waved off the fight at 2:55. Charr, who never saw the punch, was down for several minutes while receiving medical attention.\n\n3. Krzysztof Glowacki KO11 Marco Huck (Aug. 14 at Newark, N.J.)\n\nKrzysztof Glowacki's dramatic stoppage ruined Marco Huck's attempt at setting the all-time cruiserweight title defense record. Ed Diller/DiBella Entertainment\n\nThe fight was supposed to be a coronation for Huck, who had come to the United States to fight for the first time hoping to set the all-time cruiserweight title defense record at 14. Instead he found himself getting drilled in a fantastic fight that ended with Huck's body limply slithering down the ropes after getting pummeled. Huck had dropped Glowacki in a sensational sixth round and was ahead on all three scorecards as they went to the 11th. But Glowacki rallied to drop Huck for the first time in his career. Huck was badly hurt, and referee David Fields could have stopped the fight, but he allowed Huck to continue. Glowacki hammered Huck with a series of big shots, mainly overhand lefts that finally drove him into the ropes, and Huck slumped between them. Fields waved off the epic fight at 2:39. \"Huck is in major trouble! It's over! It's over! It's over! The streak is over,\" Spike announcer Scott Hanson roared. \"Glowacki with the amazing 11th-round knockout to win the cruiserweight championship!\"\n\n4.

AP Photo/Ivan Sekretarev\n\nAn all-time great a decade removed from his reign as pound-for-pound king, Jones suffered another savage knockout in this cruiserweight match with Maccarinelli, a faded but still heavy-handed former cruiserweight titlist. Jones, 46, looked out of shape, and he paid the price. He got dropped by a right uppercut with 90 seconds left in the fourth round and never recovered. Moments later, Maccarinelli landed several hard punches before finishing Jones with a clean right hand to the head that sent Jones crashing to the mat face first. Jones didn't move, and his legs twitched. Referee Ingo Barrabas immediately stopped it at 1:59 as medical personnel rushed to Jones, who was down for a few minutes before being put on his stool and given oxygen. This was about as bad as it gets and should signal the end of Jones' career.\n\nTied 5.

Dominguez pitched forward, spun around and slammed into the canvas. He was out cold on his back in the center of the ring as referee Earl Brown waved off the fight and summoned medical attention.

Ed Diller/DiBella Entertaiment\n\nBracero came into the fight with 23 wins and only four knockouts. A puncher he is not, but don't tell that to O'Connor, whom he shockingly starched in just 41 seconds. In a welterweight rematch of a 2011 fight Bracero won by decision, Bracero stunningly ended the sequel with a single right hand to the jaw over O'Connor's lazy left.

(1:23)\n\nSAN ANTONIO -- San Antonio Spurs center Boban Marjanovic barely speaks English, yet as an avid fan of rap, he often recites the lyrics of Drake and Future's song \"Big Rings.\"\n\nMaybe he's on to something, because against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday night, Marjanovic made it clear he's capable of contributing to the team's quest for another championship ring.\n\n\"I try to be useful,\" he said.\n\nMarjanovic, who is 7-foot-3, certainly accomplished as much in tying Kawhi Leonard for a team-high 17 points and going 7-for-7 from the field in San Antonio's 101-95 win over a scrappy Timberwolves team. Marjanovic, who played 15 minutes in Saturday's win over the Denver Nuggets, got more playing time in part because of the team's decision to rest Tim Duncan as a precautionary measure due to knee soreness.\n\n\"I think people look at his size and sort of think he's a big stiff,\" forward David West said. \"But Boban's a hell of a player.\"\n\nMinnesota found that out the hard way. The Timberwolves zipped out to a 10-point lead to start the game, and Marjanovic didn't enter until there was 3:31 left in the opening quarter. But 15 seconds later, Marjanovic recorded his lone block of the game. Then in the last 2:09 of that quarter, Marjanovic scored four points and pulled down the first of his four rebounds.\n\nInterestingly, when the Spurs first signed Marjanovic in the summer to add depth and youth to the frontcourt, the initial thought was the team simply acquired a big body with some upside and that there was little chance for him to make a meaningful impact this season. But as the season progressed, so did Marjanovic's development with the help of Spurs assistants Chip Engelland and Chad Forcier, who often work with him before and after practices.\n\nA three-time MVP of the Serbian Super League, Marjanovic averaged nearly 17 points and 11 rebounds in his most recent season playing for Crvena Zvezda before joining the Spurs.\n\n\"We've seen what he can do in practice,\" guard Danny Green said. \"He's getting better and better each day. He's obviously a big guy. He's really a gentle giant, and he's always apologizing. I think he's getting more aggressive now, being more physical, taking the ball from people, moving people out the way, and finishing inside. He's always had good touch. But it was just [a matter of] him catching the ball and being assertive.\n\n\"It's interesting to see him do anything,\" Green said. \"Anytime he's in the game, it still surprises me. I get excited anytime he dunks the ball without jumping, or blocks a shot or how mobile he is. I think it excites the crowd, too. He's a fan favorite already. Anything he does at his size I think is always pretty exciting and interesting.\"\n\nThe crowd on hand at the AT&T Center probably concurs, as evidenced by its reaction every time Marjanovic made a play.\n\nMarjanovic racked up nine points and a steal in the third quarter; his last bucket, on a lob layup from a Boris Diaw assist, gave San Antonio a 76-72 lead with 13.4 seconds remaining.\n\n\"He impacted the game well in both stretches he played,\" said Spurs assistant Ettore Messina, who took over when head coach Gregg Popovich was ejected in the second quarter after a pair of technical fouls. \"I think not only with his game, but also because he got the crowd involved. He got teammates involved. Also psychologically, it helped him. I am very happy. When he started playing at the beginning of the year, he was more of an attraction. Now, people understand that he is a valuable basketball player that of course has a lot to work on, but he also has some upside in his game. He is one more player we can trust and rely on.\"\n\nWest agreed, saying Marjanovic \"gave us a huge boost\" with \"just his IQ and his size.\"\n\nAs for Marjanovic, who is arguably the most engaging and among the most well-liked players inside the locker room, he is still working through the language barrier while also learning the San Antonio Spurs way.\n\nMarjanovic has averaged 13.5 points and 5.5 rebounds his last two games, hitting 80 percent from the field and 91.7 percent at the free throw line.\n\n\"I try to help my teammates, and they help me with the offense,\" Marjanovic said. \"It's good. We play together, and they use my height, and I feel comfortable when I go out on the court. I'm very happy because I'm a part of this team.\"", "Jennings, Ortiz undergoing VADA drug testing": "VERONA, N.Y. -- Heavyweight contender Bryant Jennings will challenge Luis Ortiz for his interim belt and is happy that the fight will be contested on an even playing field with both fighters being subjected to random drug testing -- blood and urine -- by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association.\n\nBryant Jennings-Luis Ortiz Where: Turning Stone Casino Resort, Verona, New York\n\nWhen: Saturday, 10:15 p.m. ET/PT\n\nTV: HBO\n\nPhiladelphia's Jennings, (19-1, 10 KOs), 31, coming off a decision loss to then-heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko in April, will face Ortiz on Saturday night (HBO, 10:15 ET/PT) at the Turning Stone Resort Casino.\n\nThe Jennings camp demanded the high-level drug testing because of Ortiz's past.\n\nIn September 2014, Ortiz (23-0, 20 KOs), 36, a Cuban defector living in Miami, knocked out Lateef Kayode in brutal fashion in the first round to win the same interim title in Las Vegas.

It can rain, and it can be warm. Folks have to be prepared and be sure that their body is adept at managing those kinds of situations. You know that early in the morning it's probably not going to be as warm as when you're finishing. Run with layers and as your body heats up and the sun comes out, you're probably going to start taking some of those off throughout the course.\n\n3. Get your #squad up\n\nMake sure to tell your family and friends so they'll support you and hold you accountable through the process.We have about 60,000 spectators that gather along the entire course of our race to show their support. We have created cheer zones, so it's about 20-plus fan-friendly cheer zones along the course.\n\n4. Avoid \"Taper Madness\"\n\nTwo or three weeks before the marathon, runners go through what I call \"Taper Madness.\" During this period, the runs are shorter (or tapered) and since it is close, one may start to become anxious and feel like they are not well prepared.\n\n5. Prepare your mind too\n\nDuring the \"Taper Madness\" period -- one should start to get into the mindset of the race. Meditating, preferably outside in a quiet place, and seeing yourself complete the course and go through the race helps to ease your mind for marathon day. Hone in on your inner strength. You want to also get rest before the race so that all of your energy will be reserved for your run.\n\n6. Get in character\n\nSome people will choose to dress in a certain costume. People also get their names on their shirts so that people can call their name and cheer them on or be identified if friends will be in the crowd.\n\nMia Hall, a Brooklyn, New York, native, has been working in the sports industry for more than 10 years as a content producer and community advocate with organizations such as the WNBA, Madison Square Garden, Black Enterprise, SLAM and Barclays Center.", "Kara Goucher won the Rock 'n' Roll San Antonio Half Marathon.": "With a 1:11:10 at Sunday\u2019s Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll San Antonio Half Marathon, Kara Goucher achieved her goal of a victory and a time close to 1:11. But she didn\u2019t get the challenge she wanted from Shalane Flanagan and Amy Cragg, who had a more modest agenda on the way to February's U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials in Los Angeles.\n\nFlanagan and Cragg did a controlled run together in 1:12:42. \u201cThe plan was to run a 73:00 or 74:00, so we were a little under,\u201d Flanagan, who was awarded third place ahead of Cragg, told Flotrack. Second place, in 1:12:35, went to Canada\u2019s Sasha Gollish, the 2015 Pan American Games bronze medalist in the 1,500.\n\nFor Goucher, Flanagan and Cragg, the day\u2019s primary concern seemed to be what the San Antonio performances told them about their current fitness and what work remains to be done before Feb. 13. Goucher and Flanagan both made the 2012 Olympic team as marathoners, while Cragg, fourth at the marathon trials, earned her spot on the U.S. squad in the 10,000.\n\nReferring to her post-London Olympic period of doldrums, ailments and surgery, Goucher told Flotrack, \u201cIf I can get in 10 weeks without injury, I\u2019ll be a totally different athlete than I\u2019ve been since 2012.\u201d\n\nWhat a race from @karagoucher, 71:09, taking the win in San Antonio! #RnRSA pic.twitter.com/b3dyW0m8Ic \u2014 Rock n Roll Marathon (@RunRocknRoll) December 6, 2015\n\nLast month, Goucher won the Big Sur Half Marathon in 1:11:13. That race and Sunday\u2019s performance have re-established her as a serious threat to make the Olympic marathon team. Before the two recent half marathons, Goucher\u2019s races of the past two years, including a 2:37:03 at the 2014 New York City Marathon, were well below her usual standard.\n\nFlanagan has been training with Cragg at altitude in Flagstaff, Arizona. Postrace, she tweeted that their effort was a \u201ckey workout to jumpstart our fitness and the hard training the next 10 weeks.\u201d She said the 1:12:42 \u201cwasn\u2019t anything super special, just exactly what Jerry [Schumacher, her coach] wanted us to do.\u201d She also used Sunday\u2019s race to \u201cimagine going at this pace for another half marathon.\u201d\n\nGoucher came away from San Antonio gratified to feel \u201cthere\u2019s more in the tank.\u201d She said she was a little disappointed that she didn\u2019t get more of a race from Flanagan and Cragg after finding \u201cit was pretty clear by the six-mile mark that they weren\u2019t coming.\u201d Goucher indicated that she hadn\u2019t been so far ahead in a race since her days at the University of Colorado.\n\nAaron Braun won the men\u2019s race in 1:04:11, more than 90 seconds ahead of runner-up Jeffrey Eggleston\u2019s 1:05:44. The pair, who\u2019ll also be at the marathon trials in Los Angeles, worked together early in the race but Braun later said, \u201cI think I was feeling better than he was at the hills [Mile 5] and just picked it up a little bit.\u201d\n\nFlanagan\u2019s and Cragg\u2019s run through San Antonio had nothing like the unexpected drama and excitement of the previous Sunday\u2019s training run in Flagstaff. Doing a 10-miler on a dirt road, they encountered a large black bear who ran down a hill and stopped on a road 50 meters in front of them. The bear soon went on its way.\n\nAnd so did Flanagan and Cragg, but a little faster than planned. Their sixth mile had been an 8:52, while the seventh was 5:50.\n\nFlanagan had declared at the beginning of the run \u201cthat if our lives were in danger, there was no way I could move any faster [because I was] so tired.\u201d As Cragg put it, \u201cturns out she was wrong.\u201d", "MVP Watch: Cam Newton leads, but Week 17 could help Carson Palmer": "TEMPE, Ariz. -- Just when it looked like Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton had the NFL MVP on lock this season, he had one of his worst games of the season, which coincided with Carolina's first loss of 2015.\n\nAlthough the Panthers are 14-1, his performance leaves the door open just enough for both Arizona Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to have a chance to steal the MVP. However, Brady didn\u2019t help himself by losing to the New York Jets.\n\nCam Newton failed to throw a TD pass in Carolina's first loss of the season, loosening his grip on the MVP award and giving hope to Arizona's Carson Palmer with one week left in the regular season. AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin\n\nPalmer was the only one of the three primary MVP contenders to win this past weekend. He had another consistent showing, setting a career high for touchdown passes in a season in a 38-8 blowout win over the Green Bay Packers that secured the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye for the Cardinals.\n\nThere is no doubting the award is still Newton\u2019s to lose, but a late-season loss isn\u2019t helping his bid. And there is this to consider: What if the Panthers lose to Tampa Bay in Week 17 and Arizona beats Seattle? The Cardinals will have moved past the Panthers for the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and both teams would finish 14-2.\n\nThen who would be the MVP?\n\nDo Newton\u2019s 14-0 start and gaudy stats earn him the honor? Or would Palmer\u2019s 10-game winning streak (if the Cardinals win Sunday) be enough to sway the minds of undecided voters?\n\nHere is a look at how the top three MVP candidates stack up with one game left in the regular season:\n\nCarson Palmer, QB, Arizona: The only MVP candidate to win this week, Palmer threw for 265 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in a blowout of the Packers. He\u2019s still leading the league in QBR, yards per attempt and yards per dropback, which shows his consistency. His lowest QBR in a game this season is 51.9, and he didn\u2019t fall below a QBR of 67 in any other game, according to ESPN Stats & Information. The only quarterback to have a QBR of higher than 50 (which is average) in all 16 games of a season was Brady in 2007.\n\nAnalysis: With a win Sunday and a dominating performance, Palmer might earn his first MVP. But he will need some help. If Newton gets corralled again by Tampa Bay, as he did in Week 4, and the Bucs pull off the upset, Palmer could slide into the lead.\n\nCam Newton, QB, Carolina: After throwing five touchdown passes in two of his previous three games, he was held without a TD pass in a 20-13 loss at Atlanta. For the first time in his career, Newton didn\u2019t complete a third- or fourth-down pass, going 0-for-7 on Sunday. Newton did add a rushing touchdown to his already impressive stats. He\u2019s the first quarterback in NFL history with 30 passing and eight rushing touchdowns. He also leads all quarterbacks in rushes, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns.\n\nAnalysis: The Panthers\u2019 offense clearly goes through Newton. It has scored 50 touchdowns this season, and 41 have been run in or thrown by Newton. It is illogical to rule Newton out of the MVP race after one loss, but if Carolina falls again Sunday, his case for MVP will be seriously questioned.\n\nTom Brady, QB, New England: Brady has slowly been dropping toward the back of the pack. He lost his third game in his past five on Sunday, throwing for 231 yards, a touchdown and an interception in a 26-20 defeat to the Jets. He\u2019s done the most with the least, leading the NFL in passing yards and passing touchdowns. And he\u2019s done it with his top five receivers missing a combined 22 games. Only 13 Pats have played in all 15 games this season, the fewest in the NFL. What is more impressive is Brady has played behind an offensive line that has used 13 players in 35 different lineups.\n\nAnalysis: None of the other primary MVP candidates has faced as much adversity on the field this season, but Brady has been slipping lately. He\u2019s having as great a season as anyone and should be commended for playing that well considering the injuries that have hit the Patriots. Brady is in the MVP hunt because he\u2019s been the constant among all the personnel turmoil in Foxborough. But his success this season doesn\u2019t stand out like Newton\u2019s or Palmer\u2019s.", "Bubba Watson overcomes himself in Hero World Challenge triumph": "NASSAU, Bahamas -- There is good Bubba and there is bad Bubba, and the avenues to both sides can often be misleading.\n\nFor example, it appeared a bit odd when Bubba Watson was not on the list of players committed to play in the 2015 Hero World Challenge. He has competed in the tournament every year since 2010. It's an easy trip from one of his homes in Orlando to the Bahamas -- which would make it look like a curious decision to skip it -- and he's playing an event next week in Thailand.\n\nOf course, there was a story -- a good one. Bubba didn't want to be away from home for two weeks; he and his family just adopted a daughter, Dakota. Fearing her adoption paperwork and passport troubles would not allow a trip to the Bahamas, he declined the invitation.\n\nEditor's Picks Hero World Challenge leaderboard Rickie Fowler opened in 30 on his front nine Sunday at the Hero World Challenge and made a charge into contention. See where he and the rest of the field finished on the leaderboard.\n\nBubba Watson sails to Hero World Challenge win Watson made four birdies in seven holes and was never seriously challenged as he sailed to a 6-under 66 and a 3-shot victory at Albany Golf Club in the Hero World Challenge.\n\nHarig: Jordan Spieth caps banner year with fourth-place finish World No. 1 Jordan Spieth didn't repeat as champion at the Hero World Challenge, but his 18th top-10 finish of the year ended his season on a high note. 2 Related\n\n\"I said no, but call me,'' Watson said. \"If somebody does back out, let me know and then I would let you know where we're at in our paperwork, right?''\n\nRight.\n\nSomebody did back out, and that was Jason Day, whose wife, Ellie, just had the couple's second child, leading to a decision to spend more time at home.\n\nAnd so Bubba was in the Bahamas, and there he was shooting 63-66 over the weekend at Albany Golf Club to win the tournament that benefits the Tiger Woods Foundation.\n\n\"I guess I've got to thank Jason Day for backing out,'' said Watson, who won $1 million from the $3.5 million purse and will remain ranked fourth in the world behind Jordan Spieth, Day and Rory McIlroy. \"I have to thank the U.S. government and passport office for getting Dakota a passport so we could be here. For us, it's a good ride, a fun ride.\n\n\"My wife joked on the green there. She said I guess she's off the team since she's the one that was putting the pressure on about we can't go if Dakota can't go. She felt bad, but it worked out in the end.''\n\nYes it did. Watson, often a tormented soul who lets golf courses get in his head -- bad Bubba -- overcame his concerns about this one to shoot 25 under par and beat Patrick Reed by 3 strokes.\n\n\"I'm probably the wimpiest guy on tour,'' said Watson, who routinely bombs 330-yard drives.\n\nThe victory was Watson's sixth top-10 finish in his past nine worldwide events dating to the Canadian Open, where he finished runner-up to Day. That followed a missed cut at The Open. Watson also missed the cut at the U.S. Open, making for a sour summer taste despite a victory at the Travelers Championship.\n\nWatson let those major venue layouts get to him. He has been brutally honest so many times about courses that don't fit his eye. Apparently, Chambers Bay and St. Andrews were part of that mix, a somewhat dubious negative that would seemingly be so far removed from a player who possesses so many skills.\n\n\"I don't have a mental coach, I've never had a swing coach, so I don't know right from wrong,'' Watson said. \"I just know, I'm just telling you the truth. ... I have fears, I have issues and I'm not afraid to admit it, and I'm going to have good days and bad days. So I guess I've had nine good weeks out of all my years.''\n\nWatson was referring to his nine worldwide victories. He once said he would retire if he reached 10 wins, but he backtracked from that on Sunday, saying wins outside of the United States don't count. He meant domestic only, and that total stands at seven -- including two Masters.\n\n\"I will give you this though: If I ever become No. 1 in the world, ever somehow, I'm walking away. I'm going to walk away on top. But let's be honest, nobody here's voting on that, right? Everyone thinks I'm not going to do that.''\n\nIt's possible, but the person who probably gives himself the least chance to do it is Bubba himself. Bad Bubba.\n\n\"It was my week,'' he said. \"I just made some putts, pulled off some shots. Next week it could be another guy. We play this same tournament next week. It's me coming in 15th or 18th and somebody else winning.''\n\nAh, Bubba.\n\nIn golf, good breaks are seemingly a prerequisite for winning. For 2015 Hero World Challenge champion Bubba Watson, he got his share -- and that was before he even teed it up. Scott Halleran/Getty Images\n\n\"When Bubba's driving it, hitting the ball as well as he is, there's not many courses that aren't very good for him,'' Rickie Fowler said. \"With him being able to work it both ways, and when he's controlling his distances as well as he has this week, I know there's some courses he may not like. I know that he wasn't a big fan after seeing the course here for the first time. But obviously, I think he's OK with it now. If he's playing well, he's going to make a lot of birdies.''\n\nSomehow, he found a way to wrap his mind around a golf course that he figured would give him fits. \"I think it's just practice, mental focus,'' Watson said. \"That's what I have to do is play smarter when I get in trouble.''\n\nWatson was headed out Sunday night for a flight to New York, followed by a trip to Thailand for the Thailand Golf Championship, an Asian Tour event. He must like the course, because Watson is going back for the fourth time.\n\nBut there were no plans to reward Day with any sort of gift for pulling out of this one in the Bahamas.\n\n\"No, he's good,'' Watson said. \"I had my best year on tour, and he lapped me. And then there was another guy [Spieth] who lapped him, so they're good.''\n\nSo is Bubba -- better than the credit he gives himself.", "Roger Federer adds to Olympic workload with Martina Hingis": "Roger Federer's decision to play mixed doubles with Martina Hingis at the Rio Olympic Games demonstrates that there's no end to his Olympic spirit. But will the all-time Grand Slam singles champ's love of the game and Olympic pageantry torpedo his chance to fill the last outstanding hole in his dazzling resume?\n\n\"I'm very excited about [playing with Hingis] because I haven't played with her I guess in 15 years,\" Federer told reporters at a press conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"I looked up to her when I was younger. I thought she was the most unbelievable talent.\n\n\"Every Olympic Games has been super ... amazing experience, an eye-opener, a great learning curve for me, seeing other athletes, getting inspired and motivated, carrying the flag is such a proud moment in my career and my life.\"\n\nFederer has played singles in all four Olympic meetings since the 2000 Sydney Games, but he's never won a singles gold medal. In fact, he's won just two medals, which is a relatively modest haul given his status. Federer won doubles gold with Stan Wawrinka in Beijing in 2008, and silver in singles at Wimbledon in London in 2012. The latter, a runner-up finish to Andy Murray, who rolled through Federer in straight sets, may be relevant.\n\nFederer was 31 years old at the time, but fatigue played a role in that loss. Olympic tennis features daily play, and Federer had been extended to 19-17 in the final set of his three-set semifinal win against Juan Martin del Potro. Federer didn't play mixed in London, and he and Wawrinka had lost early in the doubles. Yet he was still feeling somewhat rubbery-legged in the gold-medal match on that familiar Wimbledon grass.\n\n\"If I were still his coach, I would have just asked him what his priorities were.\" Paul Annacone, Federer's former coach\n\nSince then, the Olympic committee has adopted the third-set tiebreak. That will help Federer's cause. But will it compensate for four years of age and, potentially, a much heavier workload? The organizing committee's website has already worked out that Federer might have to play as many as 15 matches in eight days in Rio -- all that at 35.\n\nTennis in Rio will be played in nine consecutive days on hard courts in temperatures that are generally in the 70s. The men's final will be best-of-five; all other matches will be best-of-three. The mixed doubles will be decided by match tiebreak if the teams split sets. Sure, it could be worse. But still -- anyone entering all three events will be biting off a lot in Rio.\n\nFederer is well aware of all that, which raises the question: Is he more interested in savoring the Olympic experience one last time than in plugging the last hole in his resume with gold?\n\n\"If I were still his coach, I would have just asked him what his priorities were,\" Paul Annacone, Federer's former coach, told ESPN.com. \"Are you in Rio for the experience, to enjoy it all and take any medal you can get and not think too long-term, about the singles gold or about the US Open? If so, then go ahead, play all three. But if your priority is to win the singles I would advise against playing all three. Pick just two.\"\n\nFederer's decision to do it all may have been shaped somewhat by the fact that the Swiss have the makings of an exceptionally strong tennis team, one that the Swiss newspaper Le Matin has already rather unoriginally dubbed a \"Dream Team.\"\n\nEditor's Picks Federer to partner with Hingis in Rio 2016 doubles Roger Federer says he'll partner with Martina Hingis for Switzerland in mixed doubles at the Rio Olympics.\n\nFederer splits with Edberg, brings on Ljubicic Roger Federer has parted ways with coach Stefan Edberg, who will be replaced by former world No. 3 Ivan Ljubicic. 1 Related\n\nEven Severin Luthi, the Swiss Davis Cup captain and perhaps Roger Federer's most-trusted adviser and coach, got caught up in the hype. Not ordinarily a man given to bombast, he told the Swiss newspaper, Le Matin, \"The goal for the 2016 summer games is to win all the gold medals. Why not? We can always dream.\"\n\nPerhaps Federer just got swept up in the vibe. Let's go with the flow. Dream team. Cool.\n\nIt isn't idle hyperbole, either. Not in the wake of Federer's decision. Federer and Wawrinka both are legitimate contenders for gold in singles and as a doubles team. Hingis is a doubles/mixed genius. Rapidly developing Belinda Bencic is a potential Grand Slam singles champ -- and a more than adequate doubles partner for Hingis or Wawrinka. And the Swiss also have Timea Bacsinszky waiting in the wings.\n\nAs for that elusive gold, maybe Federer really meant it when he told reporters in Dubai:\n\n\"Winning the gold with Stan, meeting [my wife] Mirka in Sydney 2000, getting the silver in London, it felt like I won gold, but I was still very happy and it was incredible the combination to win the Olympics at Wimbledon, it was just ... maybe [it will] never happen again in my lifetime, so I really cherish that moment.\"\n\nIf Federer really feels like he already has singles gold and has won the Olympics, Rio will be more like a career victory lap. The real question becomes: What happens next, Mr. Federer?", "Alex Rodriguez, Madison Holleran stories among best of the year": "The Instagram account of Madison Holleran seemed to show a successful and happy college freshman.

They also said the plaintiffs cannot show they were harmed if the surveillance did happen.\n\nThe agencies filed court documents last week asking a federal judge in Utah to dismiss the case. A judge has not yet made a decision.\n\nAttorney Rocky Anderson, who was Salt Lake City's mayor at the time of the games, said Thursday that warrantless surveillance is harmful and the federal government needs to be held accountable.\n\n\"If these incursions on our rights of privacy and federal felonies are allowed to continue to go unchallenged, then we are further paving the road toward a more totalitarian and closed government,\" he said.\n\nAnderson said he learned about the program from a 2013 report in the Wall Street Journal and has since confirmed it with an unnamed source who worked for the NSA during the Olympics. The games in and around the Salt Lake City area took place less than six months after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nHis lawsuit was filed in August and names six plaintiffs, including Republican Utah Sen. Howard Stephenson and Utah historian William Bagley.\n\nAnderson said he has identified nearly 200 other people who could make similar claims that the agency violated their constitutional rights as well as several laws.\n\nIn their response to the lawsuit, the NSA and FBI said the plaintiffs have not shown they have legal standing to seek damages or how they were harmed by \"the claimed surveillance.\"\n\nAgency lawyers also cited federal laws that make federal government immune from a lawsuit. Attorneys said an exception under the federal Privacy Act does not apply.\n\nAnderson's lawsuit alleges the NSA and FBI collected the contents of text messages and emails and data on every phone call in the area without probable cause.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages of at least $10,000 per plaintiff. Anderson has said it could be expanded to hundreds of thousands of people -- everyone who was in Salt Lake City during that time as well as anyone who communicated with someone there.\n\nAnderson said Thursday that he plans to file a response to the government's claims and have at least one NSA source testify in the case.\n\nAnderson served as a Democratic mayor of Utah's capital city from 2000 to 2008. He was an outspoken leader who led a protest of the Iraq War during President George W. Bush's 2007 visit to Salt Lake City. In 2011, he mounted a presidential campaign under his newly formed Justice Party.", "Mikaela Shiffrin uncertain how long she will be out with knee injury": "Over the next few weeks, Mikaela Shiffrin will slalom between rest and rehab.\n\nUsually so fast on a race course, the Olympic and world slalom champion is taking things at a much slower pace as she recovers from a torn knee ligament and painful bone bruise. There's no timetable for her return to skiing, either.\n\nBut there is some promising news: She won't need surgery. Just rest. Lots and lots of rest after tearing the medial collateral ligament in her right knee during a wipeout while preparing for a giant slalom last Saturday in Are, Sweden.\n\n\"I know lots of people are anxious to predict when I might return to skiing and then racing, but we just don't have any crystal balls,\" Shiffrin posted Tuesday on Instagram. \"I will work as hard as possible, take it week by week.\"\n\nDon't write off her return this season just yet.

But unfortunately all of the tech races are now, which is not good as she will for sure miss a lot of the races.\"\n\nShiffrin was hurt when she crashed during a free skiing session on the competition hill. Albrecht said she basically flipped over and into the net. She flew back to Colorado for more tests on her knee. Shiffrin announced Tuesday on her social media sites: \"Good news from physician visit yesterday -- no additional injury from what we already knew.\"\n\nShe was considered the top contender to teammate Lindsey Vonn in the World Cup overall race, especially with Tina Maze taking the season off and defending champ Anna Fenninger sidelined with a knee injury.\n\nThat's all but vanished for Shiffrin, who won the slalom at the 2014 Sochi Olympics and at the last two world championships.\n\nShiffrin was in the midst of a stellar start, too, winning the opening two slaloms this season in Aspen by staggering margins, including one by 3.07 seconds, the largest margin of victory for the women's discipline in World Cup history. She also made her speed debut in Lake Louise, Alberta, this month and finished a respectable 15th during a super-G race won by Vonn.\n\n\"Thank you for the incredible support -- I feel the love,\" Shiffrin said.", "Kernels: A review of the most unusual MLB stats in 2015": "The 2015 season will most likely be remembered for its World Series, with the Kansas City Royals winning their first title in 30 years, and the New York Mets securing their first pennant since 2000. But before we turn the calendar, let's take a few minutes for some of the other memorable \"feats\" of 2015.\n\nThe Year of the Triple\n\nHannah Foslien/Getty Images\n\nThe 2015 campaign featured 939 three-baggers, the most since 2009. Eddie Rosario of the Twins led the majors with 15 despite not having enough plate appearances (474) to qualify for the batting title. Rosario was the first player since Hall-of-Famer Earle Combs of the 1933 Yankees to record that many triples in as few chances.\n\nThe Elias Sports Bureau noted that Paulo Orlando made triples history in April, becoming the first player since 1900 to record three-baggers for each of his first three major-league hits. He went on to have five in his first seven games for yet another record. However, we went until August without a walk-off triple, and even then it wasn't until the 15th inning. Pedro Florimon's hit was, by inning, the latest walk-off triple since Rob Natal of the newly-created Florida Marlins had one in 1993.\n\nAll's Well That Ends Well\n\nAP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast\n\nSpeaking of walk-offs, there were 207 of them this year; if you were in Chicago you got to see plenty. The Cubs (13) and White Sox (12) led the majors, and for the North Siders, it was their most since their pennant-winning 1932 season. The Sox, meanwhile, got four walk-offs from Avisail Garcia (tied for the major-league lead); not only did he receive the season's only \"plunk-off\" (game-ending hit-by-pitch), but was also issued ball four with the bases loaded to end a game. He is the first player to do both in the same season since Rodney Scott of the Expos in 1979.\n\nBut as for wacky ways to end a game, why not have a baserunner get hit by a batted ball? Taylor Featherston had that happen to him on May 2... and just a few hours later, so did Jordan Pacheco! While some occurrences have probably been lost to history, it's the first time in the known collection of play-by-play accounts that two games have ended like that on the same day. For more fun, Andrelton Simmons was also hit by a batted ball on May 2, the first time three runners have been pegged in one day since Sept. 9, 2011.\n\nThose were jonly three of the 19 runners this year to get hit with a batted ball and called out, the most in a season since it happened 20 times in 2000. Xander Bogaerts of the Red Sox took home this year's award (Matt Holliday won it last year) for being the only player to both hit a teammate and get hit by a teammate.\n\nThey Come In Bunches\n\nThe Blue Jays pounded teams throughout 2015. Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images\n\nA lot was made of the Blue Jays' run differential of plus-221, the highest since the 116-win Mariners finished 2001 at plus-300. The Blue Jays ended up with 28 five-run innings, plus one in the ALCS. That's the most five-run frames in a season since the 2008 Rangers also had 29 (yet still finished four games under .500). The Athletics had 21 five-run innings this year, and the Royals ended up with 19, including three of the five during the postseason. The last team with three such innings in one postseason also took home the World Series trophy-- it was the 2007 Red Sox.\n\nAs for high-scoring games, four teams cracked the 20-run barrier this year, as many as the previous three seasons combined. The Yankees did it twice, both times on the road, something no AL team had done since... the World Champion Yankees of 1939.\n\nOne of those games ended with a 21-5 score, a count that was exactly matched on the season's final weekend. It's the first time in major-league history that there have been a pair of 21-5 scores in the same season.\n\nPitchers Who Rake\n\nMadison Bumgarner is the game's premier power-hitting pitcher. Jose Luis Villegas/Sacramento Bee/TNS/Getty Images\n\nAlthough his two grand slams in 2014 were memorable enough, Madison Bumgarner cranked five more round-trippers this season, the most by any pitcher since Carlos Zambrano in 2006, and the most by a Giants hurler since Hal Schumaker (six) in 1934. Bumgarner had the Giants' first five pitcher home runs of the season, he got some help in September when four other pitchers each hit one. The Giants thus tied the major-league record with five different pitchers going yard (last done by the 2002 Dodgers).\n\nOne of those others was Mike Leake, who also hit the Reds' only pitcher home run of the season before being traded. He became the first pitcher to homer for two different NL clubs in the same season since Jason Schmidt in 2001. Though Leake didn't hit a triple, three other Reds pitchers (Michael Lorenzen, Raisel Iglesias, Josh Smith) did-- the first time Cincinnati's done that since 1970.\n\nSo if they're going to rake, why not move them up in the order? Sparked by Joe Maddon's leap to the National League, 13 teams had a starting pitcher bat in the eight-hole at least once this season. Maddon did it for 140 of the Cubs' 162 games, the second-most ever (behind Tony La Russa's 2008 Cardinals). Those 13 teams also included three from the American League; Jered Weaver and Trevor May became, respectively, the first starting pitchers in Angels or Twins history to bat eighth. The Minnesota franchise hadn't had anyone do it since Gene Bearden of the Senators in 1950.\n\nThanks to all this lineup-shuffling, there were also 14 games this year in which both starting pitchers hit eighth, more than doubling the number of previous such games in major-league history.\n\nMore Oddities We Follow\n\nSteven Souza (twice), Brandon Guyer: Three of six players to go for 0-for-0 while playing entire game; Rays are first to have two players do it since the 1970 Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nDavid Murphy: One of a modern-record 23 position players to pitch this season, the first to give up a grand slam since Paul Janish in 2009.\n\nIan Desmond: Second player in live-ball era to have six games with four strikeouts, joining Richie Allen of the Phillies in 1968.\n\nA.J.

Given this commitment, we are moving forward with holding the 2016 event at the Blue Monster.\n\nDonald Trump's National Doral Golf Course has a long relationship with the PGA Tour. AP Photo/Patrick Semansky\n\n\"Immediately after the completion of the 2016 tournament, we will explore all options regarding the event's future.\"\n\nTrump purchased Doral's Blue Monster Course and the resort surrounding it in June 2012. The Blue Monster course, which has hosted a PGA Tour event since 1962, has been a World Golf Championship event since 2007 with a total purse of $9.25 million in 2015, including $1.57 million going to the winner.\n\nIn 2013, the PGA Tour signed a 10-year deal to keep the event at Doral through 2023.\n\nTrump's relationship to the golf community has come under fire around the globe. An online petition urging the PGA Tour to cancel or move the WGC-Cadillac Championship has garnered almost 40,000 signatures. Also, a member of the Scottish Parliament, Patrick Harvie, has introduced a motion to the governing body proposing a boycott of two Trump courses in Scotland. And this week, Trump's branding on a billboard at a Dubai golf course and housing development was torn down.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump's public statements have upset golfing organizations. In June, the LPGA Tour, PGA of America, PGA Tour and USGA made a joint statement when Trump made inflammatory comments about Mexicans.\n\nThe PGA of America later decided to move the Grand Slam of Golf from the billionaire businessman's Los Angeles course. Trump and the PGA said it was a mutually agreed-upon decision. The 2015 staging of the tournament was eventually canceled.\n\nESPN moved its ESPY Celebrity Golf Classic from Trump's course in Los Angeles to nearby Pelican Hill in July 2015. NASCAR also pulled its season-ending awards ceremony at Trump National Doral.\n\nTrump's relationship with golf goes beyond the PGA of America, which also has its PGA Championship scheduled for Trump National in New Jersey in 2022 and the Senior PGA Championship at Trump National outside Washington in 2017. The U.S. Women's Open, run by the USGA, is to be played at his New Jersey course in 2017.\n\nInformation from ESPN.com's Bob Harig and The Associated Press was used in this report.", "Many top players choose extended season": "Novak Djokovic bailed out on his commitment to take part in the lucrative International Premier Tennis League as a Singapore Slammer last week, conceding: \"It's been a long year for me and my body needs some extra time to recover. I wish the team the very best and will join them next year.\"\n\nIn so doing, he chose much-needed rest over a spectacular payday that few of his elite peers have been able to resist.\n\nIt would seem a crushing blow to the hopes of the Slammers, one of five IPTL franchises. But before the red clay of Ghent, Belgium, had even dried in Andy Murray's socks, the Scot had stepped in as a replacement for Djokovic, and with a wingman no less -- fellow two-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka.\n\nIt's ironic. The WTA lost talent left and right to injury and fatigue this fall, despite having cut back its season to 10 months in 2009. The men still play deep into November, but both groups eschew maximum rest and recovery to spend their ephemeral offseason globetrotting after money.\n\nEditor's Picks Bodo: Davis Cup boosts Olympic tennis prestige Thanks to a successful and intriguing Davis Cup, national team tennis competition is on a high heading into next year's Rio Olympics.\n\nTrue or false: Early 2016 tennis predictions With both tennis tours on holiday, our experts gaze into their crystal balls and make five predictions about the upcoming 2016 season.\n\nCaple: Is long schedule taking its toll on players? LeBron? MLB stars? They've got nothing on tennis players' grueling schedules. But while a shorter calendar is likely not in the cards, some wonder what can be done to help stars manage the grind. 2 Related\n\nWell, it is lots of money.\n\nUpon launch last year, the league set a $10 million-per-team salary cap. Subsequently, it was widely reported that the league spent in the vicinity of $25 million on talent, with top singles players like Roger Federer (who was a replacement for an injured Rafael Nadal) earning $1 million per night. The workload: a one-set singles match featuring no-ad scoring and a 13-point \"shootout\" tiebreaker at 5-all (Federer also played in the doubles and mixed sets).\n\nIt may seem like crazy money, but it isn't out of line on the low-stress exhibition circuit, where a million-dollar payday per appearance is a reality. But with a five-city, three-week season, the IPTL takes the familiar exhibition to another level.\n\nIn its second year, the lineup includes (for some if not all matches) Serena Williams, Nadal, Federer, Maria Sharapova, Murray, Wawrinka, Kei Nishikori, Ana Ivanovic and others. The question arises: Is this league a good thing, offering elite players a chance to play a little casual tennis, pick up a bunch of cash and remain limber -- or are the players unwisely risking their longevity in order to fatten their bank accounts?\n\nIf you were struck by the frequency of injuries reported by players in September and October, it may seem like the latter. Williams, Sharapova, Nishikori and Marin Cilic were among the IPTL chosen who struggled with or mentioned injuries in 2015. Federer, 34, is no spring chicken. Nadal is trying to regroup for 2016.\n\nTennis players often cite the grind of life on the road as one of the chief factors in late-season burnout. Yet here are some of the most nomadic of the road warriors in sports, spending up to three weeks of December on what is essentially a second Asian swing. Only a handful of the stars -- Nishikori, Leander Paes, Nick Kyrgios, Samantha Stosur -- are from the region.\n\nOne side effect is that tennis no longer goes dark. The only players resting are the journeymen who have less need for rest than for earning opportunities -- the precise opposite of the elites. Like golf, tennis is becoming a \"wraparound\" sport with no real offseason. But tennis certainly is more physically grueling, so the wrap is more dangerous.\n\nThere's another problem here. As in golf, the lack of an offseason means that fans don't get a chance to miss their sport and build up enthusiasm and interest in the new year.\n\nOf course, nobody is going to confuse the IPTL with tournament tennis. It's essentially modeled after Billie Jean King's brainchild and lifelong pet project, World Team Tennis. Like WTT, which flourished for a period in the mid-1970s, the IPTL puts an emphasis on entertainment rather than competitive credibility. Both exhibition leagues do bring the game to people and places (in the case of the IPTL, Asia) the ATP or WTA may not reach.\n\n\"I'm going to five cities in three weeks,\" IPTL rookie Milos Raonic said in an interview on the IPTL website. \"That's five cities I've never played in, so that's pretty special.\"\n\nThe funny thing is, Raonic sounded like he meant it. Or maybe he's just happy that Djokovic has stepped aside, meaning that someone else will get a chance to win something this year.", "2016 Tour de France route features imposing climbs, early nod to history": "Editor's note: This story originally appeared at VeloNews.com\n\nPARIS (AFP) -- Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in western Europe, will take a starring role in the 2016 edition of the Tour de France, whose complete route was unveiled in Paris on Tuesday.\n\nNext July, Great Britain\u2019s Chris Froome will spend three days staring at the Alpine behemoth, which rises to more than 4,800 meters above sea level, as the two-time winner attempts to defend the most prestigious title in cycling.\n\nThe race departure from the world-famous Mont Saint-Michel in Normandy on July 2 has been known for a year, but that first 188-kilometer stage will also doff its cap to history with a finish at Utah Beach, one of the D-Day landing sites during the Allied invasion of Europe in World War II.\n\nIt\u2019s a Tour described as \u201ca sporting challenge in beautiful surroundings\u201d by Tour director Christian Prudhomme.\n\nThe opening stage will pass the Bay of Mont Saint-Michel, which former U.S. President Dwight D.

I figured I'd get as many matches behind me as possible and use the second one in Paris.\n\n\"I could have asked for a wild card but, at this point, I think it's better for me to get as many matches as I can in, get my ranking up to where I can get into tournaments by myself and not worry about asking for wild cards and using my protected.\n\n\"I think I have seven tournaments left including one slam, so there's plenty of time.\"", "Adrien Theaux wins World Cup downhill": "SANTA CATERINA VALFURVA, Italy -- Adrien Theaux won a wild World Cup downhill by a large margin Tuesday while Christof Innerhofer grabbed most of the attention by finishing fourth after skiing halfway down the course with a gate attached to him.\n\nTheaux won in 1 minute, 47.29 seconds on the dark and steep Deborah Compagnoni course for a 1.04-second advantage over Hannes Reichelt of Austria. It was the Frenchman's third career win.\n\nDavid Poisson of France came third, 1.15 behind -- the first podium result in the 33-year-old's World Cup career.\n\nInnerhofer missed the podium by just 0.07. About a minute into his run, the Italian got his left arm wrapped around a gate and the bright fluorescent orange panel and long pole caught onto his equipment.\n\nAfter about 30 seconds, Innerhofer rid himself of the pole but he carried the panel to the finish at speeds of about 120 kph (75 mph) -- earning the Italian loud cheers from the home crowd.\n\n\"Bode Miller's no longer around so there needs to be another crazy guy,\" Innerhofer said. \"It was really at the limit and very dangerous. I couldn't see and I was carrying the pole and the panel. ... It felt like a parachute behind me.\"\n\nAksel Lund Svindal finished seventh, ending his run of three straight downhill wins.\n\nStill, the Norwegian reclaimed the overall World Cup lead from Marcel Hirscher, who doesn't race downhill. Svindal moved 15 points ahead of his Austrian rival in the overall and maintained his lead in the downhill standings.\n\nTen of the 56 starters didn't make it to the finish, including several racers who lost a ski on the challenging course. Of the first six racers, only three completed their runs.\n\n\"It's really difficult and you had to have the legs,\" Theaux said. \"I just tried to ski relaxed. If you push too much you go off line and break your legs. I like this kind of course where it's difficult and there are a lot of turns. The difficult part is you don't see anything.\"\n\nPoisson took the bronze medal in downhill at the 2013 world championships but had never had success on the regular World Cup circuit.\n\n\"This is a big result for me,\" he said. \"It was a long time.\"\n\nPoisson was among those voicing criticism when the annual race in Bormio was moved up the road to Santa Caterina starting last year.\n\n\"I have to apologize,\" he said. \"This is a great course, and just as challenging as Bormio and even Kitzbuhel when it's rough there. You have to ski it with a lot of heart and dedication.\"\n\nThose attributes are certainly not lacking in Innerhofer, who has battled back problems throughout his career but took a medal of each color at the 2011 worlds and silver in downhill and bronze in super-combined at last year's Sochi Olympics.\n\n\"I feel like I'm starting a second career now,\" Innerhofer said. \"I don't fear anything and nothing can stop me, as you saw today.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Innerhofer announced he hopes to continue skiing through the 2022 Olympics in Beijing -- when he'll be 37.\n\n\"Skiing is my passion,\" the outgoing Italian said. \"Why think about quitting?\"\n\nNursing a big bruise on his arm and a slight cut on his nose from his escapades, Innerhofer didn't want to speculate over whether he would have won if he hadn't gotten the gate attached to him.\n\n\"I had a big lead near the end of both training sessions,\" he said. \"So make up your own mind.\"", "Botched snap past AJ McCarron burns Bengals in overtime defeat": "DENVER -- It was a moment AJ McCarron had felt prepared for.\n\nA two-time national champion in college, the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback had been in pressure situations before -- particularly those in which a close game was on the line -- based upon how he could rally his offense and lead it downfield for a key score.\n\nThis time, unlike all those games at Alabama before, he wouldn't engineer a game-winning touchdown drive.\n\nIn overtime against the Denver Broncos on Monday night, McCarron watched helplessly as a snap sailed past him and onto the ground for a fumble that was recovered in the sudden-death scenario by the victorious Broncos. It appeared McCarron wasn't ready for the football to be fired his way and could only flail after it as the ball hit the ground. When it did, the turnover preserved a 20-17 Broncos win.\n\nDeMarcus Ware's recovery of AJ McCarron's fumble in overtime ended the Bengals' hopes of earning the top seed in the AFC playoffs. Dustin Bradford/Getty Images\n\nWhat it means: The Bengals' prime-time loss pushed them down to the AFC's No. 3 seed. Their hopes of earning the conference's top seed are now completely gone, although they still have an outside shot at reclaiming the AFC's No. 2 seed with help next week. The Bengals not only have to beat Baltimore, but the Broncos also have to lose to the visiting Chargers.\n\nWhat were they thinking? After operating in sync for much of the game, McCarron and A.J. Green got out of step at perhaps the most inopportune time. With about seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, there was a moment when McCarron and Green failed to hook up on a deep third-down pass into the end zone. Just before McCarron let go of the football, Green stopped what appeared to be an intermediate route into the middle of the field. It was unclear what he was thinking at the moment or what he saw to stop his momentum. A split second after his hesitation, though, Green got going again and sprinted toward the end zone, where McCarron lobbed a pass into the back of the end zone. Although Green ultimately got in the neighborhood of the ball, he didn't quite recover enough to track it all the way into his hands. The incomplete pass led to Mike Nugent's game-tying 52-yard field goal a play later. What exactly was Green thinking?\n\nOne reason to be excited: After a finish as deflating as that one, it's hard for Bengals fans to have anything to be excited about. But remember this: The Bengals were playing a game on the road against the No. 1 pass defense, No. 1 run defense and No. 2 scoring defense. And they were doing so with a second-year backup quarterback who was making only his second career start. There were plenty of reasons for the Bengals to have been blown out on Monday, but they started fast and stayed in the game, even into overtime.\n\nOne reason to panic: For some still-unknown reason, the Bengals under McCarron continue to have trouble in the second half sustaining the momentum they had established in the first half. Last week at San Francisco, the offense went stale after posting 21 points in the second quarter. The Bengals could only muster a third-quarter field goal as they held on for a 24-14 win. Much the same thing happened on Monday night, as the offense couldn't get into the end zone. It couldn't even capitalize on a timely Denver turnover in the fourth quarter. As the Bengals start getting closer to the postseason, they need to figure out ways to play more complete games offensively.\n\nFantasy watch: Coming into Monday night's game, there weren't many compelling reasons for fantasy players to start any of the Bengals' offensive players in their championship-round matchups. Quite frankly, the combination of the Broncos' defense -- at No. 1 overall -- and the fact the Bengals were being led in prime time and on the road by a young backup quarterback didn't bode well for their playmakers to have very productive performances. In spite of all of that, though, it was Cincinnati's second-year signal-caller who actually had a solid enough outing. Although the Bengals' offense went stale in the second half, McCarron still racked up 12 points for his fantasy owners.\n\nOuch: It was supposed to be a homecoming for Ryan Hewitt to remember. Instead, the H-back will do everything he can to forget this trip to his native Denver. A former undrafted player, the expectation was that he might have a slightly bigger role in the offense with tight end Tyler Eifert out for the game due to a concussion. A knee injury on the Bengals' opening possession changed any plans Cincinnati had for using Hewitt. His night ended not long after it began. The Bengals otherwise came out of the game healthy.", "Top players cash in at the Hero World Challenge, rack up the world ranking points too": "NASSAU, Bahamas -- A week in the Bahamas is a pretty nice way to earn some easy holiday spending cash if you are a professional golfer both qualified and willing to play in the Hero World Challenge.\n\nThere are the obvious benefits to warm weather and ocean breezes.

His victory at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas was no different.\n\nHarig: Jordan Spieth caps banner year with fourth-place finish World No. 1 Jordan Spieth didn't repeat as champion at the Hero World Challenge, but his 18th top-10 finish of the year ended his season on a high note. 2 Related\n\nThere is the prize money of $3.5 million, with $1 million going to the winner and the last-place finisher assured of $100,000.\n\nAnd don't sleep on those world ranking points, where the rich truly do get richer.\n\n\"It has a lot of value,'' said Paul Casey, who has made several appearances in the tournament over the years and tied for fifth this time around, 6 shots behind winner Bubba Watson. \"This is Tiger's event, and it's an honor and a pleasure to play, and I played in it a bunch of times at Sherwood (Country Club, the tournament's former home in California.)\n\n\"What he does with his foundation is amazing, and if I can be here and contribute to that ... that's genuine, that's the main thing. That's an honor, and I love that part of it. Then it's a ton of world ranking points and a ton of money, and I haven't yet done my Christmas shopping.''\n\nCasey was only partially kidding about the latter; these guys play for million-dollar paydays every week.\n\nBut there is no scoffing at the world ranking points that were offered over the weekend to a bunch of guys who are already high in the rankings. Watson received 46 points, surpassed this fall only by the WGC-HSBC Champions event in China. The Hero World Challenge was on par with the CIMB Classic in Malaysia and the Frys.com Open, which began the 2015-16 season.\n\nAnd only the HSBC matched the Hero World Challenge with six of the top-10 players in the world competing.\n\nThose ranking points might not be that important to Watson, who began the week ranked fourth in the world behind Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and Rory McIlroy, yet still did not move up. But he did solidify his spot there. Patrick Reed landed at No. 10 with his second-place finish.\n\nThose points do mean quite a bit for India's Anirban Lahiri, a sponsor's invite who began the week ranked 39th in the world and moved up a few spots despite tying for last with Hideki Matsuyama. Both players made $102,500.\n\nThey mean a lot to Bill Haas, who was ranked 44th in the world and all but assured himself of remaining in the top 50 through the end of the year -- and a spot in the Masters if not already eligible -- after a tie for fifth.\n\nEven Casey, who began the week 24th, is in search of ranking points. Among the reasons? The Olympics.\n\n\"Some guys are unsure about the whole thing, but I'm all in,'' Casey said. \"I think it would be fantastic. Amazing. But first of all, I have to get myself in the team. It would be awesome. Get in the top 15 so you're guaranteed. I think it would be great. Just to go, just to have competed would be great.''\n\nWith the world ranking points Paul Casey earned this week at the Hero World Challenge in a non-official PGA Tour event, he's inching closer to a top-15 spot -- which would all but assure the Englishman of a place in next summer's Olympic Games. Scott Halleran/Getty Images\n\nCasey would assure himself of a spot on Team Great Britain if he is among the top 15 next July -- so long as there are not four countrymen ahead of him. Presently, Justin Rose is inside the top 15, with Danny Willet next on the outside at 19th. Casey's finish at Albany Golf Club helped in that regard moved him up to 22nd.\n\nThere might not be a better example of how much this tournament helped a player than Graeme McDowell during the first year ranking points were given in 2009. He was a last-minute invitee, although he had slipped outside of the top 50 in the world after the cutoff for entry. Players are required to be among the top 50 at the time of invitation for a limited field event that offers ranking points.\n\nMcDowell finished second that year, then moved into the top 50 to earn a spot in the Masters, which helped him get a spot in the U.S. Open -- which he won.\n\nFour years ago, tournament host Woods had slipped out of the top 50, but his victory in the tourney moved him into the top 25 and he eventually climbed back to No. 1 in the world.\n\n\"It's definitely nice to have ranking points,'' said Rickie Fowler, who finished third here. \"But you can look at it either way, as if you want it to just be a relaxing week and not have them, or to have a chance here, you have to play well to get a good finish and you still have to work your butt off to earn those points. Everyone's earned their spot here; everyone deserves to be here.\n\n\"It's a fun event, [but] you still have to play some good golf.''", "Rev3 Reveals 2016 Pro Prize Purse Structure": "Rev3 Reveals 2016 Pro Prize Purse Structure By Triathlete.com\n\nPublished Dec 16, 2015\n\nRev3 Quassy.

The 35-year-old London native who lives in Harlem had many reasons to smile -- not only because he'd just been released from the Central Park mayhem after finishing the New York City Marathon, but also because of the big, sweaty hug he received after crossing the finish line.\n\n\"I didn't even know the guy,\" England said. \"But it was really satisfying.\"\n\nIt was a grateful expression from someone who'd just lowered his personal best by five minutes. The man had England to thank for it. England served as a pacer for those aiming to run the marathon in 3 hours, 30 minutes.\n\nFresh off the course, England talked about the experience of being a pacer -- a role filled with pressure, he said, but also responsibilities he'd willingly assume any day.\n\nWhy did you want to pace the New York City marathon instead of run for yourself?\n\n\"I love being able to give back. My health is good, and I'm physically able to do it. I like that I can help other people around me run a personal best time or potentially qualify for the Boston Marathon or simply pull them through their first marathon. It's a powerful feeling to know you've helped hundreds of people run from Staten Island to Central Park.\"\n\nHow is the experience different running as a pacer as opposed to for yourself?\n\n\"It's the same experience, but I'm doing it as a volunteer. I literally do everything every other runner does. I ride a bus to the start, though it's a bus for pacers; I wear a race bib; and I run the marathon through the finish and receive a medal. It's very cool.\"\n\nWhat's most crucial for being a pacer?\n\n\"The knowledge of the course is huge. I know the course really well because I've lived in New York City for about 10 years. I feel as though I could run the last 10 miles blindfolded.\"\n\nToday you paced for 3 hours and 30 minutes, which averages 8-minute miles. If you were running for yourself, what do you suspect your pace would have been?\n\n\"I would have averaged about 6:18 minute miles.\"\n\nEditor's Picks Competitor: Kenyans take the elites to school Stanley Biwott and Mary Keitany faced plenty of challengers at the New York City Marathon, but the Kenyans used impeccable strategy and impressive fitness to pull away for convincing victories.\n\nHow challenging was it to slow your typical pace by almost two minutes?\n\n\"I'm a hybrid runner. I run just about every distance -- from a mile up to 200 miles -- and on roads and trails. My speed varies from a 5-minute mile to a 20-minute mile if I'm doing a really technical trail race, in which I'm basically hiking. So because I have a huge range of speed, I'm able to pace well.\"\n\nHow did you get assigned to be a 3:30 pacer?\n\n\"I applied to the New York Road Runners [NYRR], which organizes the New York City Marathon. It sounds kind of nerdy, but you have to have a running r\u00e9sum\u00e9 noting what marathons you've completed or how many times you've paced races. I have been running for 25 years and have completed more than 20 marathons.\n\n\"The rule is whatever you pace, you have to be able to run 20 minutes faster. My personal best marathon time is 2:45, so I'd be permitted to pace as fast as a 3:05. It's too risky to pace for a faster goal time because you might not complete the job. It's happened before when pacers don't hit their mile time or finish time.\"\n\nHas it ever happened to you?\n\n\"I've paced about six times for various distances for the New York Road Runners. I've never run a second over my time. NYRR prefers that pacers run about 30 seconds under the goal pace.\"\n\nHow did you ensure you were on your target pace today?\n\n\"I wore a Fenix 3 Garmin, which has about 50 hours of GPS. I actually didn't get GPS during the first two miles because I was on the bottom level of the first bridge. I ran about an 8:40-minute mile, which was 10 seconds off my goal. Then I ran a 7:40-minute mile for the second mile. By the time I got a GPS signal, my watch displayed a different pace than what I was actually running. I had to rely on my pace bracelet, and I also wore an elevation bracelet, which specifies what miles to go slower or faster. So at every mile I'm looking at the overall time on my watch and the information on both bracelets.\"\n\nA GPS watch and a pace bracelet were just two of the tools Stephen England carried with him during the New York City Marathon. Courtesy Sarah Gearhart\n\nDo you feel pressure because people are relying on you?\n\n\"Yeah, all of these people are looking to me. Two years ago when I paced the marathon for the first time, I thought, 'What am I doing here? I cannot screw this up.' Today I didn't feel as nervous. But around mile 8, I looked back and there were about 70 people behind me. When you start to think about the people, you do think about the pressure. But I know I can't be in my head like that.\"\n\nWhat was your communication strategy to the runners that followed you?\n\n\"Some pacers like to tell stories about New York City, but that's not really who I am as a runner. At every mile I shout crucial information, like the number of seconds over or under the pace and information about the forthcoming mile, such as if it's uphill or downhill and if we should run slower or faster. And then I stop talking.\"\n\nWhat are you pre-instructed to do if you cramp up and don't feel like you can maintain the projected pace?\n\n\"The rule is you're supposed to go the sideline and put your sign down -- no one else can carry it. You're allowed to finish the race if you want to. But, basically, if you cramp up, there's no pacer anymore. Today, though, we had five pacers in the 3:30 group because it's a really popular goal time, especially for women who are trying to qualify for the Boston Marathon.\n\nWhat, if anything, happened today that you didn't expect?\n\n\"I had to pee at mile 2. I thought about holding it, but I really couldn't for 24 more miles. So I ran off to the side to a bunch of trees. My name was on a bib on the back on my shirt, and as I was peeing I heard a lot of people shouting my name. Then I had to relocate my group so I ran a 6-minute mile to get back, and as I did so the crowd starting cheering for me again. It was comedic.\"\n\nThough the pace sign you carried was relatively light, it's still a bit unnatural to run while holding something.\n\n\"You don't train for it. I received the sign the day before at the expo. When I was a novice pacer, I was super nice and would hold the stick high in the air. Now, I hold it a little lower. It's more comfortable that way, and people can still see it. Also, I have to hold the sign in the hand opposite of the one I wear my watch on. Changing hands doesn't work because I have to look at my watch so often. I had to run down the middle of the course as I held the pace sign. I couldn't go right or left otherwise people follow that direction. So a friend that ran with me retrieved Gatorade and water the entire way.\"\n\nWhat if someone attempts to run with you the entire way but falls short of the goal time?\n\n\"I feel responsible. I feel like I've failed them. I take this role seriously. As much fun as I have doing it, I still want everyone to have a success story. But it's not always possible. I can motivate people. I can tell them about the next hill, where the Gatorade and water stops are. I can mentally help them, but I can't physically carry them.\"\n\nIt's challenging to run a marathon as a pacer. You have a lot to be aware of the entire race.\n\n\"Yeah, you're like team captain for many people. It's really satisfying. That's why I pace.\"", "Manchester City Leicester missed chances rule day in draw": "The duel at King Power Stadium ended all square as both Leicester and Manchester City keep clean sheets in their 0-0 draw.\n\nLeicester City's Wes Morgan and Kasper Schmeichel discuss their team's performance and expectations after playing Man City.\n\nManchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart feel his side should have left the King Power Stadium with three points.\n\nManchester City's Raheem Sterling says his side controlled the game against Leicester and only lacked the finishing touch.\n\nLEICESTER, England -- Here are three quick thoughts after Leicester City and Manchester City played to a disappointing, goalless draw for both teams.\n\nLeicester City Leicester City Manchester City Manchester City 0 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\n1. Missed chances rule the day for both clubs\n\nAnother day, another disappointing big game in the Premier League. Leicester and Manchester City played uninspiring football after Manchester United and Chelsea played out a 0-0 draw on Monday.\n\nThe visitors had the majority of possession and had long spells of dominance, but despite their incredibly talented and expensively assembled forward line, Man City could not break down a largely excellent Leicester defence. If ever a game was to sum up the Premier League this season, this was it. It was fast, frantic, involved a great deal of pressing and closing down, but also featured a large number of mistakes, moments of low quality and an alarming lack of poise in either penalty area.\n\nIt seemed impossible that Sergio Aguero managed to knock this chance over the crossbar.\n\nPlayers of high standing, large transfer fees and otherwise fine form seemed to line up to miss chances, from Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling, to Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. This was an encounter of much bluster, but little end-product. Both goalkeepers were required to make saves, but most would have featured on blooper reels had they not been kept out. That one of the most notable elements of the fixture was Sterling's haircut should speak volumes.\n\nThat's not to say it wasn't entertaining in spells (because incompetence often is), and that there weren't moments of quality and good performances: Wes Morgan was excellent at the back for Leicester, N'Golo Kante continued to prove he was one of the shrewdest pieces of business last summer, while Kevin De Bruyne was always threatening for Manchester City.\n\nIt also represented something of an achievement for Manuel Pellegrini's men, as it was their first clean sheet of the season without Vincent Kompany, again absent after his aborted comeback on Boxing Day. As achievements go, one shutout for a central defensive partnership -- Eliaquim Mangala and Nicolas Otamendi -- that cost in the region of \u00a380 million is not exactly mind-blowing, but it's a start.\n\n2. The curious case of Yaya Toure\n\nYaya Toure is a rather curious player these days. In his better moments, he resembles the force of nature he was a few years ago, an unstoppable and marauding midfielder who could plough his way through defences and had a much more delicate touch than he was given credit. He was a couple of midfielders in one, allowing Roberto Mancini to play a 4-4-2 formation because he was everywhere. Mancini could push forward to create a Toure-shaped juggernaut in attack.\n\nThese days, at 32, Toure is a slightly less fearsome proposition. Or at least he is for the majority of games. He can still turn it on, and still does so, but only tends to in short spells. This was most evident against Arsenal when the Toure of 2015 turned into the Toure of 2012 in the last 15 minutes of the game, scoring a beautiful goal in the process. Of course, by that point, the game was more or less lost and the sudden finding of his mojo was virtually moot.\n\nThose 15 or so minutes in which he makes a difference can obviously be game-changing for City, but it would be entirely preferable for him to, well, offer a little more than a quarter of an hour for every 90 minutes. Still, 15 minutes was more than they got against Leicester, as Toure was largely anonymous throughout, outshone by Kante and Danny Drinkwater in the home midfield.\n\nToure wasn't spectacularly bad, but he also didn't contribute enough, and in games such as this, City need more from him. Indeed, if they are to win the title in this most open of seasons, they certainly need more from him.\n\nVardy had one or two good chances, but spent most of the day isolated up front.\n\n3. Vardy isolated, as Ranieri's formation ineffective\n\nLeicester changed formation slightly to incorporate an extra midfielder, specifically semi-forgotten man Gokhan Inler, into their side, presumably to try and deal with the waspish threat of David Silva. The formation was roughly 4-1-4-1, with Inler sitting deep and Danny Drinkwater and Kante in front of him -- not the most attacking of central midfield trios.\n\nThe theory was fine, but it was executed slightly strangely, because they seemed to spend the majority of the first half bypassing that midfield and hoofing the ball over their heads in the general direction of Vardy, who was ploughing the loneliest of furrows up front on his own. Vardy was remarkably isolated, and although he did his best to unsettle Mangala and Otamendi (not always the most onerous of tasks), his effectiveness was stymied by a lack of support.\n\nMark Albrighton and Mahrez did their best from wide positions, but in general, their threat came from their own efforts, rather than trying to supply Vardy. Leonardo Ulloa came on in the second half, in theory to lend Vardy a hand, but in the end, he contributed relatively little, frequently finding himself on the left wing for reasons unclear.\n\nIt seemed like a performance designed to get a point, rather than go for a win, which was rather curious given how Leicester have played to get themselves in this position. They have been a counter-attacking team all season but have relied on their forwards' thrilling pace to slice and dice opponents, making them very effective and highly entertaining.\n\nThis was a game against the most dangerous attacking quartet in the Premier League, so an element of caution is understandable.

She placed second at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials in Houston, but was forced to drop out of the Olympic marathon later that year in London because of an injury.\n\nWith more than two strong years of running under her belt -- including solid efforts in Boston in 2014 (10th, 2:23:54) and 2015 (4th, 2:25:39) and a sixth-place showing (32:53.50) in the 10,000 meters at the U.S. outdoor track championships in June -- she's ready for 2016. We caught up with her recently to talk about her pre-Olympic trials training buildup and her expectations for the race.\n\nWhen did you start preparing for this Olympic trials?\n\nTo be honest, I think we sat down in 2012 when I was still injured and thought, \"OK, how do I get back on the team in 2016?\" So we've been thinking about Rio 2016 as far back as 2012. The last three years have been geared for heading back to the trials, so it's certainly something I've thought about a lot.\n\nI think the biggest thing about Boston was that I felt like I was moving like myself again. I had a glimpse of that in New York [at the NYC half in mid-March] after having some bumps along the way.\n\nHow did your effort in the 2015 Boston Marathon play into the grand scheme of things?\n\nThe training went right and I was able to perform at a very high level. I think that's a great thing to use as a stepping stone for the next one. Being able to make the team and start focusing on the next one would be a really nice progression.\n\nWhat will your pre-Olympic trials buildup look like?\n\n[We started] in mid-November and a 10 to 12 week buildup is pretty normal. The first two weeks is just about building mileage. I'll start in the 85-90 mile range and then slowly work up to about 115 over a few weeks, and then top out at 120 to 125 miles. We'll start getting into marathon-paced workouts not too far into the buildup.\n\nA few weeks after that, we'll switch up to faster-than-marathon pace with the same types of workouts -- like 5x2 miles and 3x3 miles at 10 to 15 seconds faster than marathon pace -- and we'll start hitting peak mileage about then, maybe 120 to 125 miles per week.\n\nYou're obviously running twice a day most days, right?\n\nYeah, I run double sessions on most days. If it's not a day in which I'm doing something of substance -- long run or a workout -- I'm probably running twice. We'll start small -- 8 miles in the morning, 4 miles in the afternoon, then to 10 and 4, and build up from there.\n\nHow long is your weekly long run during a marathon buildup?\n\nI'll only go up to 20 miles. In fact, I've only gone over that twice. Once during my Olympic buildup in 2012, I went up to 22 and apparently that's a little too much. I'll probably run 20 miles five times during my buildup to the Olympic trials between early December and mid-to-late January. Those are run a lot on feel, so once you start getting into it and you're building your mileage, sometimes you just want to go out and cover the distance or get \"time on feet,\" but we do a lot of progression runs where the final 3 or 4 miles you're running at marathon pace at the end of a 20-mile long run. And some days you just don't have it, so you just cover the distance.\n\nWhich workouts do you do that start to give you an indication of your marathon fitness?\n\nOur last big workouts are almost a month out from the race. About 4-5 weeks out, we'll do the Hanson's Marathon Simulator 26.2K at marathon pace, and 2x6 miles about 5 seconds faster than marathon pace, and an 8-mile tempo run. Those workouts are all smashed together in close proximity to each other over a week or so. From there, we mostly do lighter workouts where you're touching on marathon pace after that.\n\nThe 2x6-mile workout is always a very big indicator. It's the first time you step back from going 10 minutes faster than marathon pace and you feel pretty relaxed on that first one, and then if you can hit that second one at the right pace and sense that it's comfortably hard, it's always a good indicator that you're ready, because it really comes on top of a lot of mileage. You're tired and you're beat up and if you can hit that, it's a good sign. But really, there's no one workout that if you hit or don't hit you melt down.\n\nFor Boston this year, I was shooting for 5:20 pace for those 2x6 workouts. But when there are days where it's super windy, you just go by effort and just roll with it.\n\nDesiree Linden (then Davila) finished second at the 2012 Olympic trials, and is confident she can make the team again this year. Thomas B. Shea/Getty Images\n\nDo you do most of your workouts on the roads or do you ever get on the track?\n\nWe do a couple of things on the track, usually any workout that's shorter than mile repeats we'll do on the track. So we might do 10x800 at 15 seconds per mile faster than marathon pace. Later on, we'll do 6 or 8x mile repeats at 5:10 or so. We'll just do two of those workouts, just to feel fast, even though you're not really going that fast. It's all about cadence and rhythm and changing it up and turning your legs over a little bit.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the Hansons-Brooks team training camp in Florida?\n\nWe'll go down to Florida on about Dec. 28 and basically [will] be training down there all the way through the time we travel to Los Angeles about four or five days before the Olympic trials. It's really a good way to get footing. Running in the cold doesn't really bother anyone in our group in Michigan -- it's about finding good footing and not having to worry about slipping on ice or getting dinged up from something like that. It's a good way to remove that elements and go down to Florida to get good quality work and know where your fitness is at.\n\nI've been going to Kenya the last several years and it's sort of the same mentality to that. You're going down there to train and you have a block of time just to do the task at hand. You're not distracted by things at home -- whatever mundane, stupid things that get in the way at home that get in the way of getting rest or not eating right. That might mean going out with your friends for a beer instead of taking a nap or whatever. It will be good to go down to Florida and be with the team -- runners who are like-minded individuals who have the same goals and same schedules.\n\nAt what point will you start looking forward to the race with some real excitement?\n\nI think anytime I really hit a workout that's comfortably hard and feel good coming out of it -- you finish and you think you could have done two or three more reps -- that's when you start to get excited and you start looking forward to the next workout. As you get more fit, that happens more frequently, but then you also have to balance that with the days you feel flat and awful. But that's OK, that's part of the process. By the time you do those big indicator workouts four to five weeks out, you're usually pretty excited about the race.\n\nYou're hunkering down for 10 to 12 weeks and nobody knows what you're doing, logging a lot of miles and workouts. It's fun to think about that race because that's your opportunity to say, \"OK, this is what I've been up to.\" That's kind of how I look at it.\n\nHow long will your taper be?\n\nOur taper is only about two weeks, maybe a week-and-a-half. We keep running super-late into the buildup. I'll run a 12-miler the week of the race. It's just trying to maintain that normal balance and routine of what you're doing and not changing things too drastically so you wind up feeling lethargic and flat on race day. But it's also about freshening up too. You slowly dial the mileage down and do some short bouts of quicker running.\n\nThe biggest thing is that I try to stay super relaxed about it and not overthink anything. We'll have the travel to L.A. and the press conference once we get there, and those things sort of distract you. That's a good thing at that point because you have way more time on your hands than you have had in previous weeks. I just try to stay as normal as possible. I think you have to focus on getting more rest during that time. When you dial back the mileage, you have more energy, you're more excited and you're feeling fresher.\n\nWhat's your outlook for the U.S. Olympic trials race?\n\nIt's awesome going into the Olympic trials with so much experience. In 2008, that was my second marathon and I was super fit and ready to go and felt like I had a shot to be on the team. But a lack of experience really did me in. That was the moment where I really felt like I wanted to figure out the marathon and find out how I could do well at it. So it's kind of fun to go back for a third time and know how I've progressed since then. It's a super high-pressure situation but I feel confident going in based on my experience.\n\nI would love to win the race. I've never won a marathon and I've never won a U.S. championship race of any kind, so that would be fantastic if it unfolds that way. But it is a unique race in which if you're third, it's just like winning. You don't get a first-class ticket to Rio if you win the trials, you get the same thing as the second- and third-place finishers.\n\nDo you pay attention to the chatter about what other athletes have been doing this fall?\n\nI pay attention to it. I'm a fan of the sport and I want to know how everyone else is doing. I'm going to cheer for runners and am excited for them when they do well. When it comes to racing and preparation, the No. 1 goal is to focus on me and get myself prepared as possible. I think I'm capable of making the team, regardless of who does what in the meantime. I know that my main focus is to work on myself and get fit and if I do that, I know I have a great shot.", "Organizers pull Tour de France from 2017 WorldTour": "Editor's note: This originally appeared at VeloNews.com\n\nCycling's behind-the-scenes war blasted into clear view Friday when Amaury Sports Organization (A.S.O) announced it would pull the Tour de France and its other racing properties out of the UCI WorldTour starting in 2017.\n\nIn what's a clear rejection of proposed reforms spelled out for 2017, the Paris-based A.S.O dropped a bombshell Friday, announcing it's yanking its races out of the WorldTour calendar and slotting them into the European calendar instead.\n\nThat will give A.S.O much more flexibility and power to decide which teams will be allowed to race in its events. The 18 teams in the WorldTour are guaranteed a start in every event that is part of the season-long elite calendar. The European-calendar designation would give A.S.O almost all power in deciding which teams would start its stable of racing properties.\n\n\"We refuse the closed system,\" Tour director Christian Prudhomme told Agence France-Presse. \"This will not affect the sporting level of our races. The champions will always want to participate in the best races.\"\n\nIn addition to the Tour, A.S.O's other WorldTour properties include the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, Paris-Nice, Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, Fl\u00e8che Wallonne, Paris-Roubaix, and Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge.\n\nFollowing meetings in Barcelona last week, the UCI announced what appeared to be a compromise outline of what are largely watered-down reforms that assured 18 WorldTeams' teams three-year racing licenses starting in 2017 as well as an expansion of the international WorldTour calendar.\n\nA.S.O was oddly quiet in the wake of the UCI announcement, and Friday it decided to play its hand. With two grand tours and a large share of the French calendar, A.S.O decided to wield its power in dramatic fashion. In an interview with VeloNews earlier this month, Prudhomme confirmed his doubts about the reforms and outlined his idea of reducing the size of teams for grand tours and other major races.\n\n\"The absolute priority must be given to sporting criteria to determine the composition to the elite,\" Prudhomme told AFP. \"The principal of the 'pyramid of cycling' is fundamental. When a rider like Vincenzo Nibali wins a race like Coppa Bernocchi [ed. note: not part of the WorldTour], it's great for the public and the emotion it can arouse.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen if this latest play is a ploy to alter the ongoing reform negotiations or if it marks a permanent departure. In 2007, A.S.O similarly threatened to pull Paris-Nice out of an earlier version of the WorldTour, only to reach a final-hour compromise with the UCI to save the racing calendar that season. There is plenty of time for compromise, but A.S.O is clearly saying it does not believe in the current form of the UCI's plan.\n\nThe impact of Friday's decision cannot be underestimated. A place in the WorldTour is paramount to teams' financial underpinning, especially securing a spot in the Tour de France, the only cycling event that truly engages the general public worldwide. Without an assured spot in the Tour, teams will be completely at the mercy of A.S.O, a reality that teams have been trying to alter for the better part of the past two decades.\n\nThere was no immediate response from the UCI. Here is the full text of A.S.O's announcement:\n\n\"Amaury Sport Organisation has informed this day Union Cycliste Internationale it has opted for the registration of its events on the Hors Classe calendar for season 2017.\n\nUCI has actually recently adopted, from season 2017, a Reform of the World Tour calendar characterized by a closed sport system.\n\nMore than ever, A.S.O. remains committed to the European model and cannot compromise the values it represents: an open system giving first priority to the sporting criterion.\n\nIt is therefore in this new context and within its historical events that A.S.O. will continue to keep these values alive.\"", "Miko Grimes, wife of Miami Dolphins CB Brent Grimes, criticizes QB Ryan Tannehill": "Tim Hasselbeck weighs in on Brent Grimes' wife Miko criticizing the play of Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill on social media. (1:42)\n\nMiko Grimes, the wife of Miami Dolphins cornerback Brent Grimes, is no stranger to controversy.\n\nIn the past, Miko Grimes has used Twitter to rant about things including her husband not winning MVP honors at the Pro Bowl, his alleged mistreatment by the Atlanta Falcons, what she sees as the NFL's greed and sexism, and her unhappiness with the New England Patriots for parting company with Vince Wilfork.\n\nShe has also been a harsh critic of her husband's teammate, Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill, on her local radio show.\n\nMiko Grimes has taken aim at Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill, posting on Twitter that \"I knew this qb stunk the minute we signed to this team but I tried to keep quiet so I didn't discourage bae from believing in his team.\" Joe Robbins/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this season, Miko Grimes was arrested on charges of battery on a police officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct outside of Sun Life Stadium before a Bills-Dolphins game. The charges were later dropped.\n\nGrimes was back at it Sunday, tweeting harsh criticism of Tannehill after the Dolphins lost 18-12 to the Colts. Her Twitter account has since been protected, but not before a number of media outlets had captured her tweets.\n\n\"I knew this qb stunk the minute we signed to this team but I tried to keep quiet so I didn't discourage bae from believing in his team,\" she tweeted.\n\nOf Tannehill she also tweeted: \"I should've known we were gonna lose when I heard we didn't complete a single pass in two minute drills this week against the practice squad defense.\" She added: \"My Column: how many people does Ryan Tannehill have to get fired before you realize he's the problem.\"\n\nMiko Grimes also continued her criticism of three local sportswriters, tweeting profane comments about the Miami Herald's Adam Beasley and Armando Salguero, and Andrew Abramson of the Palm Beach Post.

Destroy the defense and make everything look like Tannehill is not the problem. #GotIt.\"\n\nThe Miami Herald reports that Dolphins officials have met with Grimes and his wife at least five times to express concern over her behavior on social media and how it reflects poorly on the team.

(16:50)\n\nHot or not\n\nJake Allen, St. Louis Blues\n\nAllen made 32 saves in a 2-0 shutout of the Boston Bruins as the Blues headed to the holiday break, and has now won three of his past four starts.\n\nMichael Hutchinson, Winnipeg Jets\n\nHutchinson made 29 saves against the Calgary Flames earlier this week, but the 4-1 loss marked five straight losses for Hutchinson.\n\nWho is the NHL's MVP at the holiday break?\n\n@Real_ESPNLeBrun: So, gang, who's your Hart Trophy pick as NHL MVP at the Christmas break? A year ago, Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price became the front-runner around this time and never looked back, and I wonder if that won't be the case again this season with Chicago Blackhawks forward Patrick Kane. The NHL's leading scorer is making offense look easy at a time when scoring is back down to pre-2005 lockout levels. He's certainly my pick at this point. But I bring you a couple of other candidates: Ottawa Senators defenseman Erik Karlsson and St. Louis Blues forward Vladimir Tarasenko. The latter is self-explanatory, with the Blues' scoring ace continuing to blossom as a superstar and helping to carry the Blues. But what about Karlsson? Since the days of the great Bobby Orr, only Chris Pronger has won the Hart Trophy as a defenseman. Why are blueliners always overlooked? I mean, where would Ottawa be without their leading scorer, Karlsson, who also is among the overall scoring leaders regardless of position. The funny thing is, I could see myself wanting to vote Los Angeles Kings defenseman Drew Doughty for the Norris Trophy at this point, with Karlsson on my Hart ballot behind Kane. Odd, I know, but I think Doughty, as a complete defenseman, is having a Norris-worthy year so far. Also funny is how the Dallas Stars and Washington Capitals don't really figure into this conversation. The Stars' Jamie Benn has been all-world, but so has linemate Tyler Seguin. How do you pick one over the other? Ditto in Washington, where Braden Holtby would seem to be the MVP, but where a balanced team effort makes it hard to pick out a single guy for Hart consideration. Thoughts?\n\n@CraigCustance: I'm leaning slightly toward Karlsson for a couple of reasons. To Scott's point, some of the best teams in the league have had a balanced attack and it's hard to pin their success on only one player. One of the things I always do when considering the Hart is try to imagine the team without that player. For instance, can you imagine last season's Canadiens without Price? It would have been ugly. The Senators would be equally as bad without Karlsson this season. Seguin has Benn. Kane has Jonathan Toews. Alex Ovechkin has Nicklas Backstrom in Washington. I don't want to undersell Bobby Ryan's rejuvenation, because that has been overlooked at times, but the Senators would be a draft-lottery team without Karlsson. He's a complete game-changer and has as many points as Tarasenko. Karlsson has more points than both Sedin twins, more than Nicklas Backstrom and Evgeni Malkin. And he's doing it as a defenseman. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone more valuable to his team right now than Karlsson.\n\n@ESPNJoeyMac: I can't remember a season in which there were so many worthy candidates by Christmas. Off the top, I would have to go with Kane 26 times, not only for his recent point streak, but for an incredible all-around season. At this point, I don't know how anyone would disagree he's the front-runner for the Hart. Along with Kane, Benn and Seguin, you also mentioned Tarasenko, Pierre. Wow, can that kid play. You see the numbers, but when you watch him in person it's clear he's a tremendous player. If the Hart was based on heart alone, Karlsson would win it. The ice time he's logging is mind-blowing. No one should be able to keep up that pace for an 82-game season and have success in the playoffs, but maybe he can prove me wrong. And as much as I believe Price deserved the Hart last season for his heroics, I'm not sure Holtby is in the same category this season. He has been beyond outstanding, but the Capitals as a whole have been, too. But if were had to pick right now, no doubt Kane gets my vote.\n\n@ESPN_Burnside: I think it's interesting there really isn't a clear-cut Hart favorite from the teams that are head-and-shoulders above the crowd in each conference, Dallas and Washington. Yes, Seguin and Benn will get some consideration, but they are not where Kane is. I agree with Joey Mac on Holtby, and I'm not sure I'll even have Doughty at the top of my Norris list, let alone in Hart consideration. And that's not a shot at Doughty, even though he has carped mildly about not winning the Norris. For me, this season is shaping up very much like season, when it seemed from a very early juncture in the season that Price was going to win the award provided he stayed healthy. He did remain healthy, and so the question then became who else would earn a spot on the final ballot. I think Kane, if he stays healthy, will follow a similar path as Price to his first Hart victory. Who else on my holiday Hart ballot? Right now I'd go Benn and Karlsson.\n\nAround the league", "The Road To The Beer Mile World Record": "The Road To The Beer Mile World Record\n\nKirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports Last December in Austin, Herndon won the inaugural Flotrack Beer Mile World Championships with a time of 6 minutes 17.76 seconds.\n\nElizabeth Herndon is an assistant professor in the Department of Geology at Kent State University. She's also the women's world record holder of the beer mile.\n\nLast December in Austin, Herndon won the inaugural Flotrack Beer Mile World Championships with a time of 6 minutes 17.76 seconds. (She's also a competitive marathoner -- sans beer -- and, safe to say, she's likely the coolest college professor you could hope to have.)\n\nA test of speed and chugging ability, the beer mile requires competitors to drink a 12-ounce can of beer, run a lap around a 400-meter track, drink, run, drink, run, drink, run. Runners must finish the entirety of their brews. Purging -- voluntarily or involuntarily -- will get you disqualified.\n\nThis year's race will be held Tuesday night in Austin. While Herndon, 30, won't be defending her crown, we sat down with her to learn a little about her unlikely road to an unlikely world championship.\n\nespnW: How did you discover you had a talent for the beer mile?\n\nHerndon: The ability to drink large volumes of liquid very quickly is somewhat of a natural talent. At restaurants, I'm the person who drinks their glass of water before the waitress can even leave the table. I also used to drink a lot of Diet Coke, so I had some experience with the carbonation. I didn't specifically try the beer mile until a few years ago, but I did pretty well the first time (7:24). Running with the beer in my stomach didn't seem to bother me too much, which is a key component of the beer mile.\n\nespnW: Do your skills mostly lie in chugging beer, running fast, or some of both?\n\nHerndon: It's definitely a mix of chugging and running fast, but certainly a big component is being able to tolerate the beer sloshing around inside your stomach. I certainly wasn't the fastest person there, but I did have the fastest running splits. Interestingly, I was able to run about as fast as I can without drinking beer!\n\nespnW: What made you settle on drinking the Belgian-style Fat Tire for the Beer Mile World Championships? What other beers did you test out?\n\nHerndon: My husband and I practiced chugging with a couple different beers, and I found that Fat Tire was pretty smooth and pleasant to drink. We also tried Sierra Nevada (too flavorful) and PBR (too foamy), and I used Molson, Blue Moon and Yuengling in past beer miles. Fat Tire was a clear winner.\n\nespnW: How did you prepare for the race, in terms of run training and beer drinking?\n\nHerndon: I didn't adjust my running at all, but thankfully I was training for a 5k when the beer mile came around. Normally I'm a marathoner, so the 5k speed workouts were definitely helpful. I was doing track workouts once a week with my team (Cleveland Elite Development). For beer mile-specific training, I tried chugging a few different beers over the course of a few weeks before the race. I wanted to find the right beer and practice the proper technique.\n\nespnW: Can you describe the physical sensation of chugging a beer and then running a fast lap -- and repeating that four times?\n\nHerndon: The hardest part was trying to breathe and drink beer at the same time. I ended up taking many very short sips of beer just so I could breathe also. The beer itself gets pretty painful by the end. There's some definite side-cramp issues.\n\nespnW: Did you go into the race thinking you had a good chance of winning?\n\nHerndon: Definitely! I knew there would be a lot of competition, but I felt strongly that I was a contender for the win. My friends love that the announcers called me \"the one no one talked about!\" as I came into the finish. My strategy was to keep the running controlled so that I could handle the chug.\n\nespnW: What is the appeal of doing this kind of event?\n\nHerndon: I think we often take life much too seriously. The beer mile is a great opportunity to be a little ridiculous and challenge yourself in a unique and fun way.\n\nespnW: What else are you training for right now?\n\nHerndon: Right now I'm training for some local road races, and then I'm focused on the Olympic marathon trials in February in L.A. I have a great team that I'm fortunate to run with a couple times a week, and they make the process a total joy.\n\nFrom first-time yogis to veteran triathletes, each body in motion is a successful one.

(1:22)\n\nDENVER -- Given the intense way he plays, Vontaze Burfict believes NFL referees have put a target on his back. He thinks anything he does from here on out -- no matter how seemingly minute -- will be under the refs' microscope.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals linebacker said Monday after his team's 20-17 overtime loss to the Denver Broncos that a key call that went against him in the overtime period occurred because an official happened to see his number. With so much riding on the then-tied game, Burfict said it was the wrong time for a flag to come out.\n\n\"The refs, they obviously have it out for me, but you can't call a bulls--- flag like that at the end of the game,\" Burfict said. \"He looked at my number and then threw it.\"\n\nVontaze Burfict said he pleaded his case to head referee Ed Hochuli -- to no avail. Gregory Shamus/Getty Images\n\nBarely a minute into overtime, with the Broncos driving on their side of the 50, Burfict made contact with tight end Virgil Green along Denver's sideline. As soon as the players collided, Burfict started trying to strip the ball. He continued doing so until it became clear he would have to make the tackle, but by the time Burfict tackled Green, the pass-catcher was on the Broncos' sideline and going out of the field of play.\n\nThe official who flagged Burfict called it unnecessary roughness, and the linebacker was penalized 15 yards. After the play, the Broncos had a first down with the ball on the Bengals' 41. Nine plays later, Denver kicked a 37-yard field goal to take an early overtime lead. Two plays after that, the Bengals were unable to match the score, as they fumbled on a shotgun exchange to end the game.\n\n\"The refs were late to blow whistles all night, and they threw the flag late,\" Burfict said. \"Once the dude [Green] flopped, the ref looked at me and seen it was my number and then threw the flag. I can't control that. Just keep playing football.\"\n\nBurfict said he tried to figure out why the flag was thrown and pleaded his case to head referee Ed Hochuli.\n\n\"I said, 'Ed, what happened? No whistles were blown?'\" Burfict said. \"He was like, 'Yeah, no whistles were blown, but he said you hit him late.' I said, 'What?' and just went on about it.\"\n\nCoach Marvin Lewis couldn't tell what happened because the play occurred on the opposite sideline.\n\n\"He's trying to tackle a guy, and they are struggling. A lot of those things don't get called, and they let it go,\" Lewis said. \"Both sides are pushing. I don't think he does anything besides push the guy as he goes out of bounds. It happens all the time.\"\n\nBurfict has a growing negative reputation around the league, thanks to opponents' criticizing his post-whistle play. Panthers tight end Greg Olsen called Burfict out last season for twisting his and Cam Newton's ankles after tackling them. Steelers players took exception earlier this season to the way Burfict appeared to celebrate after tackling running back Le'Veon Bell on a play that ended Bell's season in Week 8.\n\nBurfict was fined nearly $70,000 for three incidents that occurred in the Bengals' Week 14 game against Pittsburgh: roughing the passer, a face mask pull and unnecessary roughness. One of the plays that resulted in a fine came when Burfict dove low into Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's feet.

Oklahoma also owns elite status with seven national titles since 1950, 861 wins and 45 conference crowns. The Sooners haven't won a national championship since 2000, but they've played for the title three times since and posted four top-10 finishes since 2007.\n\nEditor's Picks Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic: No. 3 Michigan State vs. No. 2 Alabama Check out ESPN's coverage of the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic, which will be aired live on ESPN on Dec. 31.\n\nCapital One Orange Bowl: No. 4 Oklahoma vs. No. 1 Clemson Check out ESPN's coverage of the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Capital One Orange Bowl, which will be aired live on ESPN on Dec. 31.\n\nTop 25 players in the CFP: Watson is No. 1 The CFP bracket is littered with the very best talent. But who are the 25 best players, in order? Start with Clemson QB Deshaun Watson, and then things get very interesting. 2 Related\n\nThe other playoff participants, Clemson and Michigan State, are tougher to label elite. Both programs own national titles, but not recently (Clemson's last was in 1981, Michigan State's in 1966). Both regularly record 10-win seasons and, recently, victories against the unquestioned elite. Urban Meyer has lost four games in four seasons as Ohio State's coach; three came against Michigan State or Clemson.\n\nBut few would categorize Clemson and Michigan State in the same way as Alabama and Oklahoma. If they did, they would have to think about it first.\n\n\"I don't think they're elites yet, but they're both headed in the right direction,\" said Tommy Bowden, who coached Clemson from 1999-2008 and now serves as an ACC Network analyst. \"Clemson and Michigan State can both be there. If there's seven steps, they've got five-and-a-half or six of them done.\"\n\nWhat defines elite status, and how close are Clemson and Michigan State to achieving it? Here's how the programs measure up in four key categories.\n\nRecruiting\n\nElite programs are built on the ability to attract top recruits annually. Star ratings and class rankings don't guarantee championships, as blue-chippers bust and talent slips through the cracks. But the top programs have to compete and win on the trail.\n\n\"It's the most important thing,\" Bowden said.\n\nClemson: Although the Tigers haven't competed for national titles on Mondays in January, they have regularly been in the national discussion on the first Wednesday in February. Coach Dabo Swinney's past five recruiting classes have ranked fourth, 12th, 13th, 10th and eighth nationally by ESPN Recruiting. The 2016 class currently ranks 17th and should rise in the coming weeks.\n\n\"When I was at Clemson, the first three years we had one guy drafted,\" Bowden said. \"They have eight or nine a year now. They've definitely elevated the level of talent. You can check that box for them.\"\n\nThe Tigers' talent propelled them this season. They lost seven players from the 2014 defense that opened this season on NFL rosters. They have started five first-year starters along the offensive line for much of the season.\n\n\"Clemson's different today than when I was first at Wake,\" said Jim Grobe, who coached Wake Forest from 2001 to 2013. \"Their depth has improved so much that they're able to overcome injuries.\"\n\nDabo Swinney and Clemson have been winning big on the field as well as big on the recruiting trail with five straight top 15 classes. AP Photo/Richard Shiro\n\nMichigan State: The Spartans are known as an elite player development program but not an elite recruiting operation. MSU has shown you can win big without necessarily winning signing day. Coach Mark Dantonio has taken lightly recruited prospects, such as cornerbacks Darqueze Dennard and Trae Waynes, and turned them into first-round draft picks. Big Ten Network analyst Gerry DiNardo, the former coach at Indiana, LSU and Vanderbilt, remembers an early Dantonio recruiting class consisting almost entirely of players from Michigan. The reason: Dantonio wanted as much in-person scouting as possible.\n\nNone of Michigan State's past five recruiting classes finished in ESPN Recruiting's Top 25. The past two classes ranked No. 29. The 2016 class currents stands at No. 18 and could vault into the top 15 by signing day. After 36 wins, two Big Ten titles and two major bowl victories in the past three seasons, MSU is attracting a higher-caliber recruit.\n\n\"They found their niche to get it going,\" DiNardo said. \"Now their niche to continue to be in the elite conversation is to show up high in the [rankings] the first Wednesday in February.\"\n\nAdministrative support\n\nGreat coaching and historical success aren't enough to sustain or obtain elite status. Programs need administrative support, especially strong athletic directors, as well as outside support to keep pace in facilities, coach salaries and other areas.\n\n\"It's a great marriage between certainly the coach, the athletic director and maybe most importantly the president,\" said Rick Neuheisel, the former coach at UCLA, Washington and Colorado. \"We all have a clear understanding of what we want and how to achieve it, and then are willing to go out and finance the expectations we've created for ourselves. That doesn't guarantee success, but it gives you your best possible chance for success.\"\n\nClemson: Bowden remembers the metal lockers at Clemson when he arrived. He soon pushed the university for facilities upgrades. Clemson built new locker rooms and offices in 2007, renovated them last year, and built a $10 million indoor practice facility that opened in 2012. Last month, Clemson broke ground on a $55 million complex that will complement football necessities with a miniature golf course, bowling lanes and laser tag, among other luxuries. Athletic director Dan Radakovich, a member of the playoff selection committee, is considered one of the best in the industry.\n\nClemson recently had the nation's highest-paid assistant coach on staff in former offensive coordinator Chad Morris. Defensive coordinator Brent Venables, who earned just more than $1.4 million this season, is the nation's fifth-highest paid assistant. According to USA Today, Clemson ranks sixth in total staff pay, one spot ahead of Florida State.\n\n\"I think Dabo's slogan is, 'All in,'\" Grobe said. \"That's not just the coaches and the players. That's the university adopting an all-in mentality with everybody committed to winning. All those player-driven facilities help in recruiting. Clemson and Florida State are probably talking about the same things. That gives [Clemson] a chance to be an elite program.\"\n\nMichigan State: Few university leadership teams are as aligned as Michigan State's, and Dantonio often credits the support he receives from athletic director Mark Hollis and the university's administration. Hollis is considered one of the nation's most innovative and accomplished ADs.\n\nIn 2008, before Dantonio's second season, MSU opened the Skandalaris Football Center, an addition to the old football building with new offices and meeting rooms. Michigan State also has expanded its weight room and last year completed a $24 million renovation of Spartan Stadium that included new locker rooms.\n\nMSU doesn't spend nearly as much on its coaching staff as Clemson, but it briefly made Dantonio the nation's second highest-paid coach in 2014. Former defensive coordinator Pat Narduzzi was among the 10 highest-paid assistants before leaving to become Pitt's head coach last December.\n\n\"The resources at Michigan State have to be close to the resources of any school we are calling elite,\" DiNardo said. \"They don't have to be as good, but they have to be close. So Michigan State has rebuilt their football building. They have built their facilities. Are they the best in the country or the conference? No. But they're in the conversation. That goes to salaries, too.\"\n\nRecent big-game success\n\nSome historical powers are considered elite because of what they were, not what they are. But any new program seeking admission to college football's elite fraternity must provide recent evidence of winning at the highest level.\n\n\"Nick Saban has been the benchmark for every football program out there because he's been able to be in the hunt year in and year out,\" Neuheisel said. \"Winning one [title] is proof that you're among the elite, but competing for them on a regular basis definitely gets you there.\"\n\nClemson: Although Swinney won or shared the ACC Atlantic Division title three times in his first four full seasons; he struggled against rivals Florida State and South Carolina. Swinney secured notable bowl wins against Ohio State (2014 Orange) and LSU (2012 Chick-fil-A), but he truly broke through this fall with wins against Notre Dame, Florida State and North Carolina. Clemsoning is dead, and Clemson is starting to show it's a big-game program.\n\nSwinney has seven wins against top-eight teams, including two this season, but No. 4 Oklahoma is the highest-ranked opponent Clemson has faced in a bowl since the 1982 Orange, when it beat Nebraska to secure the national title.\n\n\"My father [legendary Florida State coach Bobby Bowden] was good for a long time, but he didn't win [a national title] for 20 some years, and then he did,\" Bowden said. \"He was the guy who couldn't win the big one. Mack Brown was a guy who couldn't win the big one until they won it. Tom Osborne might have been the same.\"\n\nMichigan State: While Swinney recently has improved his big-game reputation, Dantonio's is infallible. He is 7-1 in his past eight games against top-10 opponents (6-1 since 2013). Dantonio is the first coach in Big Ten history to record five 11-win seasons in a six-year span. His 65 wins since 2010 are third-most nationally behind Saban and Fisher. His teams have recorded 16 fourth-quarter comebacks, including three this season.\n\nMichigan State went from not winning major bowl games or Big Ten titles to doing both in recent years. The Spartans have thrived as underdogs, which they are again against Alabama in Thursday's semifinal.\n\n\"A national championship could be one thing that closes the argument,\" DiNardo said. \"We can argue about Michigan State [being elite], but if they win the national championship this year, is the argument over? It might be.\"\n\nMark Dantonio and the Spartans are 7-1 in their past eight games against top 10 opponents and Dantonio's 65 wins since 2010 are third- most nationally behind Alabama's Nick Saban and FSU's Jimbo Fisher. Mike Carter/USA TODAY Sports\n\nLong-term sustainability\n\nThis is the toughest category to assess because it's truly a projection: Could Michigan State and Clemson sustain success without Dantonio and Swinney? Even the established elite programs can backslide with the wrong coaches. The key for those striving for elite status is establishing a strong enough foundation where multiple coaches can win big.\n\n\"It's one of the true measures of being elite,\" DiNardo said.\n\nClemson: A favorable recruiting location, strong administrative support and improved facilities have Clemson well positioned for the future. But Swinney has become the smiling, dancing, garrulous, pizza party-throwing face of the program this year. There's a fun, familial feeling around the program that isn't easy to foster in big-time college football.\n\nFive Clemson coaches have won ACC titles, and Swinney's successor will step into a more ready-to-win environment than he did. But life after Dabo will be challenging in Death Valley.\n\n\"Florida State would be a good indication,\" Bowden said. \"When my father left, Jimbo Fisher came in and won the national championship. If you get the right guy, then the schools that have all the bells and whistles, the support of the administration, finances and all those things, you can keep on going.\"\n\nMichigan State: In recent weeks, Saban has repeatedly praised Dantonio for doing what he could not at Michigan State, the program he led from 1995-99. Dantonio has systematically built MSU into a Big Ten power, first asserting dominance against in-state rival Michigan, and then taking aim at league bully Ohio State. Although Duffy Daugherty recorded two great seasons in the mid-1960s, Dantonio has ushered MSU into its greatest sustained period of success.\n\nMichigan State is a much better job than when Dantonio arrived, and top coaches would be interested in it. But there would be significant doubt about sustaining this performance without him, at least initially.\n\n\"Can someone else come in and do it because the tools clearly are already on those respective campuses? The answer's yes,\" Neuheisel said. \"But ultimately, it's about marrying the concept of championship-caliber performance but also financing that expectation.\"\n\nThe verdict?\n\nNeuheisel says both Clemson and Michigan State are on the cusp of elite status. \"They're new to the party,\" he said. Both have the mix of coaching, support and recent track record. But there's a next step, one that can be made in the next two weeks.\n\n\"Ten-win seasons, championships, New Year's Day bowls, there's similar ingredients involved,\" Bowden said. \"To have elite status, there's several pieces to the puzzle, but the crowing jewel is the national championship.\n\n\"That's what separates you from the rest.\"", "Walters looking for the knockout against Sosa": "VERONA, N.Y. -- As he prepared to defend his featherweight world title in June, Nicholas Walters was in an enviable position.\n\nEight months earlier, Walters, an exciting puncher who goes by the nickname \"Axe Man,\" made a name for himself by scoring a sensational sixth-round upset knockout of Nonito Donaire to seize his title. That victory got people talking and Top Rank promoter Bob Arum was looking to line him up for a title unification fight against Vasyl Lomachenko for the end of this year provided Walters could get past Miguel Marriaga, who had handed him an amateur loss.\n\nNicholas Walters-Jason Sosa Where: Turning Stone Casino Resort, Verona, New York\n\nWhen: Saturday\n\nTV: HBO, 10:15 p.m. ET/PT\n\nWalters did get past Marriaga, although by easily outboxing him for a unanimous decision win rather than it being the kind of action fight most expected from the big punchers. But although Walters kept his perfect record intact against Marriaga, the fight with Lomachenko had gone down the drain the day before because Walters was overweight and stripped of his 126-pound title.\n\nWithout the carrot of another title belt to win, Lomachenko and his team were not interested in the fight. So Walters will carry on without his title and without Lomachenko, having moved up to the 130-pound junior lightweight division to take on hard-punching Jason Sosa with a chance to make another big impression.\n\nSosa is also looking to make a name for himself when he and Walters meet in a scheduled 10-round fight on Saturday night (HBO, 10:15 ET/PT) on the undercard of Cuban defector Luis Ortiz (23-0, 20 KOs) making the first defense of his interim heavyweight belt against Philadelphia contender Bryant Jennings (19-1, 10 KOs) at the Turning Stone Resort Casino.\n\nWalters (26-0, 21 KOs), 29, of Jamaica, said he took responsibility for being nearly a pound overweight for the fight with Marriaga and is not dwelling on what happened.\n\n\"We have moved on from last June, but it always plays in the back of your mind what we could have done -- or should have done -- to not lose the title on the scale,\" Walters told ESPN.com on Thursday. \"But we have to get over that. We lost the title. That was in the past.\n\n\"Now we're fighting a good fighter, Jason Sosa. He's coming off 13 knockouts in his last 13 fights. It's a big fight. We have to think about what we have in front of us in Jason Sosa and take care of that business.\"\n\nDespite being stripped of his title on the scales, Nicholas Walters easily outpointed Miguel Marriaga in June at New York's Madison Square Garden. Mikey Williams/Top Rank\n\nWalters harbors thoughts about returning to featherweight and still would like to fight Lomachenko. He says he believes he can still make that weight.\n\n\"We have to think if we are going to stay at 130 or go back to 126,\" Walters said. \"I can go to 126. In the Marriaga fight I was 126.6. There were a few things that cost us the title, but we can make 126 if the price is right, if the opponent is right. But we would like to win the 130 title. All the great fighters win a title, move up and win another title. I'm no different, same thinking.\"\n\nWalters, a standout amateur whose chances of making the Olympics were dashed by Marriaga at a qualifying tournament, is much more experienced against better professional opponents than Sosa (18-1-3, 14 KOs), 27, of Camden, New Jersey, who had only three amateur fights and went 1-2. But Sosa has looked strong in recent fights.\n\nHe has won 14 bouts in a row, including the 13 straight knockouts and has not lost since a first-round knockout in his fifth pro fight in 2010. When the fight with Walters was offered he jumped at the chance to fight him.\n\n\"We're here for one reason and that's to become world champion,\" Sosa told ESPN.com. \"And in order to become a world champion you have to fight best and I believe he's one of the best. And I'm ready to show the world that I'm also one of the best. It's a big step but at the end of the day this is boxing. You got to fight. You can't expect to be a champion through loopholes.\n\n\"You look at my background, it's three amateur fights. I had to fight every like it's my last. I'm learning in the pros. He got the background with the amateurs but that's amateurs, this is the pros. He do got more experience, but boxing is boxing and it only takes one punch.\"\n\nRafael's Boxing Blog Get the latest scoop and analysis on the world of boxing from ESPN.com's Dan Rafael in his blog. Read \u00bb\n\nSosa has landed a lot of them to fashion his knockout streak and expects to find Walters with one as well.\n\n\"Somebody is getting knocked out and I don't think it's gonna be me,\" Sosa said. \"Pretty sure it's not going to be me.\n\n\"I have been working extremely hard on speed and angles because we know that Walters is flat-footed and I want to make sure I have an advantage with movement on fight night. We know that Walters is a tough fighter with an impressive record. He has beat Donaire and [Vic] Darchinyan, which are both strong opponents. But we also believe that we are the bigger fighter being that this is his first fight at 130. He has never felt power like mine and I believe that will be my biggest advantage.\"\n\nSizing up the two fighters a few feet apart from each other Thursday, Walters appeared to be the physically bigger man. He said Sosa's supposed size advantage does not mean anything.\n\n\"I know most definitely his game plan. We think he wants to turn this into a fight,\" Walters said. \"I'm supposed to be the smaller guy, but I'm not the smaller guy. Don't even think that I'm gonna run from this guy. I'm gonna fight my fight [and] give my people a good fight, a tough, strong fight. I'm looking for the knockout, most definitely I'm looking for the knockout. But let's see what happens on Saturday night.\n\n\"We have done our work and we are hoping to give the people a great Christmas gift of fireworks.\"", "College Football Playoff Preview: Alabama\u2019s Dominant Run Attack vs. A Lucky Michigan State Team": "Alabama and Michigan State face each other in a late New Year\u2019s Eve game that could stretch into 2016 (depending on your time zone). Alabama is the favorite, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model, as the Tide have the nation\u2019s top defense and a dominant running back in Derrick Henry. The Heisman winner is quite the workhorse, rushing 90 times in his previous two games. Michigan State, on the other hand, is lucky to be in the playoff at all. Although they\u2019ve managed an impressive record en route to a Big Ten championship, the Spartans have often won \u2014 as against Michigan \u2014 by the skin of their teeth.\n\nAlabama: Is Derrick Henry being run into the ground?\n\nDerrick Henry has had a magnificent season, racking up 1,986 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns, earning him the Heisman Trophy. He has also had a tremendous workload, carrying 339 times in 13 games, with at least one and possibly two left to play. This came to a head in Henry\u2019s final two games before the playoff, with him carrying 46 times against Auburn and another 44 against Florida. The questions here are obvious: Is Derrick Henry being run into the ground? Might his workload negatively affect his pro career? Probably not, at least as far as we can tell.\n\nIf Henry were an NFL running back, we might point to the fabled \u201cCurse of 370.\u201d The curse is an idea popularized by Aaron Schatz at Football Outsiders; when Schatz singled out running backs who had 370 or more carries in an NFL season, he noticed that they subsequently performed poorly. There\u2019s considerable dispute over the specifics of such an effect, but workload concerns take on added meaning for college running backs, who have not yet begun their pro careers, and who, one might worry, are coughing up earning power one 40-carry game at a time.\n\nIf the \u201ccurse\u201d exists at the college level, then Henry\u2019s season is a red flag. Henry is averaging 26.1 rushes per game \u2014 the 25th-highest per-game workload of any FBS player over the past 12 seasons. The carries have clustered in the back half of the season, as well: Over the first six games of the season, Henry averaged 20 carries per game; in the last seven, he has averaged 31.3. In total, Henry has carried the ball 339 times this season \u2014 17th most in FBS play over the past 12 seasons \u2014 with more football left to play. Given his workload in the last two games, he might careen right past the infamous 370 mark in just 14 games.\n\nNow for the good news: Based on the available stats, a heavy college workload has no relationship to a shorter shelf life in the pros. Of 97 running backs who have played at least four NFL seasons since 2005, there\u2019s no statistical relationship between college rushing attempts (either total or per game) and whether the RB suffered a drop-off in NFL production between his first two years and years three and four.\n\nOf course, some NFL backs peak early and fade quickly. One can think of Alfred Morris, Knowshon Moreno, Cadillac Williams and LeGarrette Blount. In some cases that\u2019s because of injury, but often it\u2019s just a decline in production. Take Kevin Smith: Smith carried the ball more than 900 (!) times while at the University of Central Florida; in one particularly cruel year, he had 450 rushes. And, sure enough, Smith peaked early in the NFL. He rushed 455 times for more than 1,700 yards in his first two seasons. But that trailed off to just 106 total carries in years three and four. It\u2019s cases like this that make it tempting to draw a link between a running back\u2019s college workload and his pro decline. \u201cHe was just run into the ground,\u201d you could say.\n\nBut there are plenty of counterexamples. DeAngelo Williams, DeMarco Murray and Ahmad Bradshaw, for instance, all had more than 500 college rushing attempts \u2014 which is where Henry, with 547 carries, is now. Yet these backs got better as their pro careers progressed into the third and fourth years. A regression analysis between college rushing attempts (both total and per game) and the change in NFL production (whether in yards or total carries) found no relationship at all.\n\nOf course, this analysis looks only at the first four years of a back\u2019s pro career; this was done to give us a sufficient sample (97 backs) and to avoid plaguing the analysis with a survivorship bias, as better backs have longer careers, and running backs in general have short tenures in the league.\n\nSo if Derrick Henry goes for 40 or more carries for a third straight game, we\u2019ll likely hear that he\u2019s being used up and his best pro years are being shortened. Several years down the line, that may turn out to be true. But the argument against overuse has always been that performance takes a hit in the next few years after a heavy-workload season, and with college rushers, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case \u2014 at least for now.\n\nMichigan State: Lucky or good?\n\nIt\u2019s the play of the year: Michigan State was down 23-21 at The Big House, 10 seconds on the clock, Michigan punting on what would surely be the final play of the game. It was \u2014 just not the final play anyone could have imagined: Michigan State blocking a Michigan punt and returning it for a touchdown as time expired. What was likely the most exciting moment of the college football season also perfectly represents Michigan State\u2019s run \u2014 a year of close calls and near-failures, but success in the end.\n\nThe Spartans are 12-1 heading into the College Football Playoff vs. Alabama on Thursday. They got there not by dominance, but by the skin of their teeth. Are they lucky, or are they good? They\u2019re both.\n\nStart with the obvious: Michigan State has a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9. It ended the season ranked No. 4 according to ESPN\u2019s Strength of Record, a statistical measure of how impressive a team\u2019s wins and losses are. Just ahead of Michigan State are \u2014 no surprise \u2014 the other playoff contenders: Clemson, Alabama and Oklahoma.\n\nTEAM RECORD CHANCE A \u201cGOOD\u201d TEAM MATCHES THIS RECORD AVG. WIN PROBABILITY STRENGTH OF RECORD GAME CONTROL Clemson 13-0 2% 77% 1 1 Alabama 12-1 2 73 2 2 Oklahoma 11-1 7 71 3 3 Michigan St. 12-1 14 67 4 14 Source: ESPN\n\nUnderpinning this ranking is the probability that an average top-25 team \u2014 specifically, a team rated in the 90th percentile according to ESPN\u2019s Football Power Index \u2014 would have this team\u2019s record or better after playing this team\u2019s schedule. So the typical \u201cgood\u201d team had only a 14 percent shot at matching the Spartans\u2019 12-1 record. That\u2019s impressive, but it lags far behind the top three; Clemson and Alabama have accomplished what a typical top-25 team would have only a 2 percent probability of matching.\n\nAlthough Michigan State has earned a strong record, it has been awfully lucky en route. For instance, in the two weeks before that miracle win against Michigan, the Spartans had close calls against Purdue and Rutgers. Their habit of cutting it close caught up with them when Nebraska delivered their only loss in a thrilling and controversial 39-38 upset.\n\nThe Spartans recovered from that loss with big wins against Ohio State and, in the Big Ten title game, versus Iowa. But both games were extremely close. Michigan State never led until the final play of the game against the Buckeyes, and it took an epic 22-play drive in the conference championship\u2019s final minutes to beat Iowa.\n\nLuckily there\u2019s a stat to illuminate how dominantly a team wins: ESPN\u2019s Game Control rating, which is a reflection of a team\u2019s average in-game win probability, adjusted for opponent strength and aggregated throughout the season. Think of it as a metric that determines how early big powerhouse schools put the game out of reach and thus avoid the coin-flip finishes Michigan State hazarded coming down the stretch.\n\nAlthough the familiar trio of Clemson, Alabama and Oklahoma rank No. 1 through No. 3 in Game Control, the Spartans are No. 14. That\u2019s because their average in-game win probability was just 67 percent. By contrast, Clemson won in far more dominant fashion \u2014 on average, the Tigers had a 77 percent in-game probability of winning. (And the Tigers won all their games, after all.)\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to look at Michigan State\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and thumb the scale on the side of luck; success in close (and especially flukey) games has never been very replicable in football, college or pro, and the Spartans had more than their fair share. But this dim view misses the fun parts of MSU\u2019s season: It\u2019s the only team to arrive in the playoff having played a full slate of thrilling games, instead of the more typical championship route, which involves a few competitive conference games sprinkled into an otherwise sleepy march to inevitability.\n\nAlok Pattani contributed database research to this article.\n\nRead more: Clemson\u2019s One-Man Offense vs. The Balanced Sooners", "MLB's Strange But True Postseason Feats of 2015": "Don't blame Daniel Murphy -- he didn't know he could look forward to an October reincarnation as Babe Ruth. AP Photo/John Bazemore\n\nCrazy stuff happens in October. Ever noticed that? For instance:\n\nThe team that lost the World Series was the team that always seemed to be winning. ... Whereas the team that won the World Series was the team that apparently decided holding a lead before the eighth inning was overrated. ... Not to mention ...\n\nThe most dominant slugger of the 2015 postseason was a man who headed into October with approximately the same career home run ratio as (we kid you not) Freddy Galvis. ... And, lest we forget, even a catcher tossing a baseball back to the pitcher suddenly ceased to be routine in this particular nuttiness-laden postseason.\n\nSo this is where we get to relive all that nuttiness -- via the Strange But True Postseason Feats of 2015.\n\nStrangest But Truest Champions of the Year\n\nThe Royals congratulate themselves on one of the Strangest But Truest World Series wins. Peter Morgan / AP\n\nYou'd think that in order to win the World Series, it would be helpful to hold a lead once in a while. But the team that actually did win the World Series, those lovable Kansas City Royals, clearly seemed to think that was optional. So how'd they wind up riding on those parade floats? Here's the Strangest But Truest part of their story:\n\n\" The Royals played 53 innings in this World Series. They held a lead after only 13 of them. That sounds like a recipe for getting swept. So instead, naturally, the Royals won in five. But here's our advice if they have any ideas about doing this again next year: Don't try that at home! Want to guess how many teams had ever won a five-game World Series while holding a lead for that few innings? NONE, of course, according to our friends at the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\n\" But even if the Royals were thinking about winning in six or seven next year, it's still not a good idea. You know how many other teams have won a World Series of any length despite leading after that few innings? Elias could only find one -- Jeff Conine's 1997 Marlins. That team also led for a mere 13 innings. Then again, it had to go to extra innings in Game 7 to get there.\n\n\" Can we have a moment of sympathy for that team K.C. was playing, those New York Mets? Based on sheer arithmetic, the Mets should have been the ones jumping up and down. After all, they led in every game of this World Series. They even led in the eighth inning or later in four of them. If all World Series games were seven innings instead of nine, they'd have been the team that won in five. Unfortunately, they were required by the rules to keep playing. And that didn't work out so well.\n\n\" So the Royals rampaged back to win three different games in which they trailed in the eighth inning or later. And how many teams have ever done that in the same World Series? Right you are. Zero.\n\n\" Or maybe this would put that late-inning magic in better perspective: The Royals won as many games after trailing in the eighth or later of this World Series as the 10 teams that played in the previous five World Series combined! In those five World Series, the clubs that led in the eighth or later went 24-3. Uh, not this year.\n\n\" By the way, we should probably mention that no team had lost even TWO games it led, in the eighth inning or later, in the same World Series since Byung-Hyun Kim started serving up late-night gopherballs for those Arizona Diamondbacks in Yankee Stadium in 2001. But mostly, we just mentioned that because we felt like typing the name, \"Byung-Hyun Kim.\"\n\n\" And in case Byung-Hyun is still reading, he might be interested to know that the Mets led after almost twice as many innings (24) in the World Series as the Royals -- and lost. Well, friends, that's just about impossible. Before this year, Elias says, the most innings any team had ever led on its way to losing a five-game (or four-game) World Series was 15 (by Placido Polanco's 2006 Tigers). And the Mets managed to lose despite leading after 24. My goodness. How the heck did that happen?\n\n\" Well, it happened because all the Royals did in this postseason was set their alarms for the sixth inning -- and then wreak havoc. Think about this: They won 11 games in this postseason. They trailed in the sixth inning (or later) in six of them!\n\n\" But, of course, they did that sort of thing all year, right? Wrong! The Royals' winning percentage in the postseason, when they entered the sixth inning trailing, was a ridiculous .545 (6-5). The Royals' winning percentage when they entered the sixth inning trailing during the season: .172 (11-53). That's just nuts. Don't you think?\n\nRoyals 2015 postseason scoring What was Kansas City's motto in October? \"Better late than never.\" Frames Runs Scored Runs Allowed Run Differential First 6 innings 39 55 -16 7th inning on 51 11 +40\n\n\" Have we mentioned that the Royals seemed to have some sort of fondness for those late innings? Heck, they considered the first six innings to be pretty much irrelevant, apparently. Check out that spread of runs scored by innings!\n\nWow. No wonder those teams they played kept asking themselves: \"What just happened?\"\n\n\" And you know that expression, \"no deficit was too large?\" That one applied, too. Seven times in this postseason, the Royals won games in which they trailed by AT LEAST two runs. Seven times. The old record was five, by the 1996 Yankees. Does this stuff blow your mind, too, or is it just us?\n\n\" Now here come two final things you have to remember: First off, the Royals did this the hard way -- one humongous hit at a time. How many balls did they hit in the entire World Series that left the park? Exactly one, by Alex Gordon, in the ninth inning of Game 1 of the World Series. And that's it. But we should add: excellent timing!\n\n\" And here's the other thing you have to remember: Besides this juggernaut, only two other teams in history had ever won a World Series the way the Royals did in Game 5 -- by finding themselves at least two runs behind in the ninth inning or later of a clinching game and then roaring back to win. Hopefully, your great-grandfather filled you in on those two, since they happened in 1929 (A's) and 1939 (Yankees).\n\nSo that's how they did it. We witnessed it with our own eyeballs. We're still not sure how it was possible. But we're pretty sure it had something to do with the fact that, along the way, they unfurled their . . .\n\nFive Strangest But Truest Royals Magic Tricks\n\nUnlikely hero Christian Colon celebrates giving the Royals their World Series-winning lead in Game 5. AP Photo/David J. Phillip\n\n\" Remember the Strange But True ninth inning of the final game of the World Series? Remember Eric Hosmer making his fabled, crazed dash for home to score the tying run on a \"routine\" ground ball to third? It's not like you see THAT every October (or November). The last time a team scored the tying run, in the ninth inning or later of a World Series game, on an infield out was Game 7, 1960. Yogi Berra hit the ground ball. Mickey Mantle scored the run. How cool was that?\n\n\" Remember the guy who singled in the Strange But True winning run in the 12th inning of that final game? He's going to make an awesome Mike and Mike trivia answer some day. It was -- who else? -- backup infielder Christian Colon. And naturally, before that hit, he hadn't even made it into the batter's box, let alone recorded a life-changing World Season hit, in FOUR WEEKS. He drove in zero runs in the ninth inning or later all season. And he'd never had an extra-inning RBI in any regular-season game in his career. But he has now had two postseason at-bats in his life. One was a game-tying, 12th-inning hit in the 2014 wild-card game. The other was a game-winning, 12th-inning hit in the 2015 World Series. Is he the ultimate Strange But True Royal, or what?\n\n\" Remember the Strange But True way this World Series started? With Alcides Escobar chugging out an inside-the-park homer on the first pitch the Royals saw in the entire World Series? Well, holy schmoly. It was the first inside-the-park homer in a World Series game since 1929. It was the first inside-the-parker to lead off the first inning of a World Series game since the second Series game ever played, in 1903. And then there's this: This game later ended on an Eric Hosmer walk-off sac fly. It was the 7,547th game in Royals franchise history -- regular-season and postseason. Guess how many began with their leadoff hitter slashing an inside-the-park homer and their last hitter of the day turning into a walk-off hero? Yep. The correct answer would be none.\n\n\" Remember the Strange But True way the Royals even got to the World Series? With Lorenzo Cain firing up his turbines in the eighth inning of American League Championship Series Game 6 and motoring all the way home from FIRST base. On a single. To score the winning run. Wow. As breathtaking as that was, though, it wasn't even the first time Cain had scored from first on a single in this postseason. He also did it in the last game of the Division Series. Now wrap your brain around this: Only three times in the entire regular season did any team score the way Cain scored the run that clinched the ALCS. No outs. Man on first. Comes all the way around to score on a single. But it felt like just another day in the life of those Strange But True Royals. Unbelievable.\n\n\" And, finally, remember the Royals' greatest Strange But True October comeback of them all? Down four in the eighth in Houston, in Game 4 of the ALDS. Then put up five in the eighth and two in the ninth to force a Game 5? Well, if that one looked kinda familiar, do you have any recollection of that 2014 AL wild-card game? Right. The one in which the Royals trailed by four runs in the eighth inning of another postseason elimination game and found a way to win? So how many other teams have ever had a comeback like that in a postseason game that would have sent them home for the winter? Zero. And, as loyal tweeter Matt McMullen reminds us, the Royals have now had two of them. In back-to-back postseasons. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the stuff that Strange But True Feats of the Year columns are made of. Oh, that and also ... World Series rings.\n\nStrangest But Truest Postseason Paths of the Year\n\nThe journey to October begins on crisp February mornings. But when teams dream those October dreams on those spring training mornings, we have a hunch they don't envision trying to make it into the postseason by doing stuff like this . . .\n\n\" The Blue Jays went 35 games in a row without a save -- and still made the playoffs.\n\n\" The Blue Jays also had a losing record as late as July 28 -- and still made the playoffs.\n\n\" The Rangers had a minus-42 run differential (and a losing record) as late as Aug. 13 -- and still made the playoffs.\n\n\" Even more amazing, the Rangers were the last team in baseball to win two games in a row (took them all the way until May 5) -- and still made the playoffs.\n\n\" Possibly even more amazing than that, on Oct. 3, the Rangers blew a four-run lead in the ninth when they had a chance to clinch their division -- and still made the playoffs.\n\n\" The Astros went 22 games in a row in August and September without winning two in a row -- and still made the playoffs.\n\n\" The Dodgers went 42 consecutive innings without scoring a run on the road -- and still made the playoffs.\n\n\" The Pirates had a losing record against every team in their division -- and still made the playoffs.\n\n\" The Mets scored fewer runs, from Opening Day through July, than any team in baseball -- and still made the World Series.\n\n\" The Royals, who obviously didn't want to break out their late-inning domination too early in the year, were the last team in baseball with a walkoff win (finally did that on July 3) -- and still won the World Series.\n\n\" The Mets and Dodgers both got no-hit twice this year -- and still made the playoffs. But at least they had company. There were six no-hitters thrown against National League teams this year. And how many of them were against teams that made the playoffs? Every stinking one of them. Of course!\n\nStrangest But Truest October Bombardier of the Year\n\nTake a curtain call, Daniel Murphy -- your postseason power display will forever be Strange But True! Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n\nFor eight years, we could see that Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy had a highly useful talent for the always invaluable bat-meets-ball portion of baseball. But one thing we never figured we'd see was this same Daniel Murphy spending the first couple of weeks of October reminding us of George H. Bambino Ruth.\n\nDon't ask us how this stuff happens. If baseball made more sense than that, you'd never get to read columns like this. So just kick back and remind yourself that this man did all this stuff in his actual life. Not that it would be any easier on an Xbox.\n\n\" Have you seen this guy play much? He'd never hit five home runs in any calendar month of any regular season. He then hit SEVEN home runs in October. Hey, of course he did.\n\n\" More than 900 regular-season games into Daniel Murphy's career, he'd only homered in back-to-back regular-season games once. And then, in October, he hit a home run in back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back POSTSEASON games. Right.\n\n\" Now would be a perfect time to mention that Hank Aaron hit six postseason home runs in his whole career (over 17 games and 74 plate appearances). And Daniel Murphy hit postseason home runs in six games IN A ROW. Baseball.\n\n\" No player had ever homered in six straight games in any of the Mets' 54 regular seasons. So it made perfect sense that Daniel Murphy would then homer in six games in a row in this postseason. Wait -- what?\n\n\" Here's just an abbreviated list of players who have never, ever hit a home run in six games in a row in the regular season: Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, David Ortiz, Miguel Cabrera, Jose Bautista, Prince Fielder and Ryan Howard. But Daniel Murphy did it in the POSTSEASON. Seriously.\n\n\" Regular-season home runs this year by Daniel Murphy against humans who throw left-handed: one. Postseason home runs by Daniel Murphy against humans who throw left-handed: three. Two off Clayton Kershaw. One off Jon Lester. Crazy.\n\n\" Want to take a wild stab at how many regular-season home runs Daniel Murphy had ever hit against Kershaw, Zack Greinke, Jake Arrieta and Lester? That would be zero. But he homered against all of them in this postseason. Naturally.\n\n\" Finally, imagine how hard it would be to homer against three pitchers like this in the same postseason -- the pitcher who led the major leagues in strikeouts, the pitcher who led the major leagues in ERA and the pitcher who led the major leagues in wins. Well, it must be kinda challenging, because no one had ever done it. Or, at least, no one had ever done it until this October, when Daniel Murphy homered off Kershaw, Greinke and Arrieta. Un-be-lieve-able.\n\nTen More strange But True October Classics\n\nJose Bautista's mother of all bat flips was the signature moment in one of the Strangest But Truest innings of October. Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images\n\n\" The Cardinals should have known they were in trouble this October when they scored six runs in an National League Division Series game started by Jake Arrieta -- and still lost. Before that, they'd won their previous 54 games in a row when they scored six runs or more -- off anybody.\n\n\" Where were you during what might have seen the Strangest But Truest Postseason Inning Ever? Seventh inning. ALDS Game 5. Rangers-Blue Jays. Featuring all of this . . . What could have been the series-deciding run scoring when Russell Martin made what he thought was about his 1 billionth run-of-the-mill toss back to the pitcher, only to watch it somehow deflect off the bat of the hitter, Shin-Soo Choo, and dribble up the third-base line. ... The Rangers making suicidal errors on three consecutive hitters to kick off the bottom of the inning. ... Two bench-clearing screaming matches erupting over one epic Jose Bautista bat flip. . . . And the whole thing unfolding over 53 minutes of unforgettable Strange But True Madness. Whew!\n\n\" The Mets' Strangest But Truest October feat? They beat the top three finishers in the NL Cy Young election (Arrieta, Greinke, Kershaw) in the same postseason. And how many teams before them had ever beaten the top three in any Cy Young election in any Octoberfest? None. Of course.\n\n\" Did you know that Ken Griffey Jr. played 2,671 big league games and never played in a World Series? So we're guessing Raul A. Mondesi isn't his favorite active player then -- because he showed up in a real, live World Series box score this year (Game 3) after playing in NO regular-season big league games. Mondesi's father played in 1,525 games, by the way -- and he never played in a World Series, either. Bizarre.\n\n\" While we're on this Strange But True Rookie roll, how 'bout Kyle Schwarber? As loyal tweeter Michael Adamo reported, he hit home runs in Double-A, Triple-A, the big leagues, the wild-card game, the Division Series and the LCS all in the same year. ... And not only that. Schwarber also became the first player ever to hit a postseason home run and win the MVP of the Futures Game in the same year. ... And not only that; for his finest Strange But True trick, he hit a majestic NLDS home run that landed on top of the right-field video board at Wrigley Field -- and stayed there. Let's see Jordan Spieth stick that lob wedge some time.\n\n\" More Cubs Strange But Trueness: In Game 3 of the Division Series, their 1-2-3-4-5-6 hitters all homered. In one day. According to Elias, there have only been two REGULAR-SEASON season games in history in which any team's 1-2-3-4-5-6 hitters homered. But one of those came this year, when the Mets got homers from their 1-2-3-4-5-6-7 hitters in an August game in Philadelphia. So in other words, this happened once in 139 seasons -- and then happened twice in two months. Because the universe is a big fan of Strange But Trueness, it turns out.\n\n\" Bet you never thought you'd hear the name Keone Kela in the same breath as two all-time baseball legends. But here goes: In Game 2 of the ALDS, the Rangers won a 14-inning game, and that made Kela the third pitcher in history to win a postseason game of 14 innings or longer on Oct. 9. So who were the others? Oh, just Roger Clemens and Babe Ruth. Whoever they are.\n\n\" Digest these two facts: One, that Wade Davis hadn't picked a runner off any base in two years. And two, no pitcher had picked off any runner in the ninth inning of a one-run postseason win in over 40 years (since Mike Marshall ambushed Herb Washington in the 1974 World Series). So you know where this is leading. Ninth inning. ALDS Game 2. Carlos Gomez gets picked off first by -- you've got it -- Wade Davis. Never saw that coming.\n\n\" Other stuff you probably never saw coming: Jake Arrieta stole as many postseason bases (one) as the guy who led his team in steals this season, Dexter Fowler. ... Sean Rodriguez started at first for the Pirates in the wild-card game -- and got pinch-hit for before he ever made it to the plate. ... After waiting 12 years to play in a World Series game in his home park, David Wright hit the amazing Strange But True home run in his very first at-bat at Citi Field in Game 3 of the World Series. ... On the other hand, Ben Zobrist hit more doubles in the postseason (eight) than Wright hit during the season (seven). ... David Price made three postseason starts, and the Blue Jays lost all three of them. During the season, naturally, Price made 11 starts for the Blue Jays -- and they lost only two of them. ... Cliff Pennington had more postseason pitching appearances (one) than hits (none). Which is notable because Cliff Pennington isn't a pitcher. ... And in the first nine postseason plate appearances of his life, Jorge Soler reached base in (gasp) all nine of them. Which figured, since he reached base five times in the entire month of September.\n\n\" But all that just set the stage for the No. 1 Strangest But Truest Postseason Feat of the year: Remember the Rangers' aforementioned 14-inning ALDS game? Well, you'll never guess who knocked in the game-winning run. It was a fellow named Hanser Alberto, whose claim to fame was this: He tallied zero hits for them after Sept. 1. And now the cool part: Only one other man before him had ever delivered a game-winning postseason hit in the ninth inning or later after going 0-for-September/October. And it was -- wait for it -- Willie Mays, for the Mets in Game 2 of the 1973 World Series. So how about that? The Say Hey Kid meets the Say Who's That Kid. It could only have happened in the Strange But True Postseason of 2015.", "Dana White On UFC 193 'This Event Changed Everything'": "Dana White On UFC 193: 'This Event Changed Everything'\n\nZuffa LLC via Getty Images \"Ronda Rousey and Holly Holm broke all our records,\" says UFC president Dana White of UFC 193. \"This thing was off the charts.\"\n\nHolly Holm wants to punch you in the face. And that's OK.\n\nHolm is the newly minted UFC women's bantamweight champion, so excuse her for wanting to do her job. But as the best female boxer, kickboxer and now mixed martial artist in the world, Holm loves what she does for a living. And there's a legion of young women who now have the same idea.\n\n\"When I fight, I never want it to be close,\" Holm says. \"If it's close, that means I didn't do enough. But that's why I love what I do -- to keep pushing myself to be better.\"\n\nHolm and the woman she knocked out, the previously undefeated Ronda Rousey, are now the pied pipers of women's MMA. If the sport had momentum before UFC 193, it strapped on a jet pack after Holm and Rousey got done.\n\n\"This event changed everything,\" says UFC president Dana White. \"Ronda Rousey and Holly Holm broke all our records. This thing was off the charts.\"\n\nAccording to White, UFC 193 drew 57,240, with a gate take of more than $9 million. He estimates the pay-per-view figures, when finalized, will mark that fight as either the second- or third-largest pay-per-view event the UFC has ever put on.\n\n\"Women in the main event and co-main event,\" says White, who famously once claimed he'd never see women's MMA in the UFC. \"No fight card has ever done that in the history of combat sports. So, to me it was a great decision.\"\n\nHe says the vast improvement of women's skills and athleticism has been key to that success.\n\n\"There was a day and a time -- and it wasn't just me -- that nobody thought the women would be so technically sound,\" White says. \"The fact is, a lot of women's sports are adjusted for women. Like in golf, women hit from short tees.\n\n\"Not MMA. It's still five 5-minute rounds for title bouts, and three 5-minute rounds for regular fights,\" White adds. \"It's the same as watching two men fight.\"\n\nNext-gen fighters\n\nAt a time when the UFC was starving for a superstar -- male or female -- it was Rousey who came along and became the promotion's most bankable star. And now we can add Holm to that.\n\nHowever, Rousey and Holm will not fight forever. And to ensure the sport's long-term success, the UFC has been diligently scouting and cultivating women's MMA talent.\n\nTo most UFC fans, the names Sean Shelby and Joe Silva are familiar -- they are two of the UFC's primary talent evaluators and match makers. Shelby oversees all men's weight classes below 155 pounds, as well as the women's bantam and strawweight divisions. Silva is responsible for all men's weight classes 155 and above.\n\nBut two people alone can't scout the entire world, so UFC relies on a large global network of current fighters, managers, agents and local promoters to keep them apprised of emerging talent.\n\nSome areas of the world have been particularly fruitful.\n\n\"Brazil and Mexico have been regions of focus lately, along with UK, Ireland and Poland,\" says Dave Sholler, UFC director of media relations. \"Additionally, our team works hard to identify talent in places like Canada, Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, India and more. As UFC and the sport of mixed martial arts have grown globally, so too have our efforts in talent identification.\"\n\nWomen are consuming our product via live events, on pay-per-view, on television and via UFC Fight Pass more than ever before. Dave Sholler, UFC director of media relations.\n\nLikewise, Shannon Knapp, president and founder of the all-women's promotion Invicta, says she and matchmaker Julie Kedzie also rely on a large network of MMA contacts to keep tabs on up-and-coming talent.\n\n(For the all-female cast of the \"Ultimate Fighter 20,\" UFC acquired 11 strawweight fighters from Invicta.)\n\nBut male or female, Knapp and Kedzie are looking for the same thing: elite athletes.\n\n\"The scouting process for women is no different than for men,\" Knapp says. \"The approach and what we want is exactly the same -- elite athletes. I'd say some of the best talent we've found thus far has been in Brazil.\"\n\nAdditionally, UFC keeps abreast of individual combat sport communities, such as jiu jitsu, Muay Thai, boxing and taekwondo. And the Olympics also continue to be a source of elite athletes, and as Rousey has illustrated, one elite Olympic skill (say, judo) can help a fighter not only survive, but dominate opposition that simply has no counter to that level of skill. Until, that is, she meets up with another fighter like Holm with a comparable Olympic-caliber skill (say, boxing).\n\nBut elite athlete or not, male or female, not everyone likes getting punched in the face -- often the deal breaker for many trying to make the leap to MMA.\n\n\"It takes a special kind of person to accomplish -- compete -- at the level Ronda and Holly have,\" White says. \"Think of all the people who have competed in judo, but Ronda's the only one who made the successful jump. Normally in judo and wrestling, you don't like getting hit in the face. It's a tough transition.\"\n\nEmpowering fans, and the future\n\nThe old archetype that fighting is \"unladylike\" has officially been replaced by \"badass,\" empowering a new generation of women to embrace combat sports. Women's MMA has gone from undercard curiosity to bona fide headliner.\n\nIndeed, more and more women are turning to MMA as participants, for training and fitness, and as spectators. Women now make up 30 percent of the UFC's fan base.\n\nMitch Viquez/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images Ultimate Fighter 19: Michelle Waterson punches Angela Magana in their women's strawweight bout during the Ultimate Fighter Finale on July 12, 2015, in Las Vegas.\n\n\"There are a lot more female UFC fans than you would think. I think my fan base is about 50/50, to be honest,\" Rousey says. \"Fighting isn't a men's thing or women's thing. It's the same thing.\"\n\nOf course, Rousey's impact has been indelible on the sport itself.\n\nLeading up to UFC 193, UFC promoted a series of videos branded \"The Rousey Revolution,\" showcasing just some of a new generation of female fighters.", "Holly Holm finishes Ronda Rousey": "Whether you want to chalk it up to Holly Holm's perfect game plan, a mismatch of styles, Ronda Rousey's lack of preparation or all of the above, Holm's head-kick highlight will live on in MMA history.\n\nA former world champion boxer, Holm (10-0) knocked out Rousey with a high left head kick in the second round of a UFC female bantamweight title fight on Nov. 14.

Good thing she didn't.\n\n\"It's hard to put yourself out there sometimes,\" Holm said, following the victory. \"I know a lot of people thought it was early. I didn't expect the phone call to come this early, but I always look at it as, 'If you don't take the opportunities that are in front of you, how are you ever expected to get somewhere?'

AP Photo/John Locher\n\nIf this beats out Holm's head kick on your 2015 list, fair enough. Aldo has been the most dominant featherweight in the sport's history, and no one saw him going out like this. McGregor said before the fight that the Brazilian champion would be stiff and overcommit on the right hand. It took just 13 seconds for him to be proved right. It's the fastest finish in UFC title fight history.\n\n3. Paul Felder, KO2/2:09 at UFC 182 on Jan. 3 vs. Danny Castillo\n\nPaul Felder's spinning backfist to put Danny Castillo down in January was one of the best finishes of the year. Rod Mar for ESPN\n\nThis fact wasn't as well known at the time, but the spinning backfist Felder used to put Castillo down in January is actually one of his favorite punches. The Philadelphia native has impeccable timing and instincts on that particular strike despite the fact he rarely throws it in the gym (too much of a hazard for his sparring partners).\n\n4.

The punch came, however, amidst a flurry of punches from Weichel, who had Freire badly hurt. The featherweight title fight nearly ended in the first round, when Weichel dropped Freire with punches and the Brazilian had to be saved by the bell. This perfectly placed counterpunch kept the belt around Freire's waist that night.\n\n5. Makwan Amirkhani, KO1/0:08 at UFC on Fox on Jan. 24 vs. Andy Ogle\n\nMakwan Amirkhani scored one of the fastest KOs in UFC history against Andy Ogle in January 2015. Martin McNeil for ESPN\n\nFrom time to time, you'll see fighters take flight into a knee strike the moment a contest starts. Sometimes it works, often it doesn't. It worked for Amirkhani against Ogle in Sweden. The Finnish featherweight had the courage to throw it in his UFC debut, and it led to an 8-second finish. Had Ogle gone out from the shot (Amirkhani landed a few follow punches for the knockout), it might have been the fastest KO in UFC history.", "Chicago Bulls bench comes up big against Toronto Raptors": "CHICAGO -- Tony Snell scored 16 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter in Monday night's 104-97 win over the Toronto Raptors. Aaron Brooks and Bobby Portis combined to score 29 points, grab 12 rebounds and dish out seven assists. On a night in which Jimmy Butler scored just five points and Nikola Mirotic and Taj Gibson mustered only six points combined, the fact that the Bulls were able to win against one of the Eastern Conference's better teams serves as another sign that up and down this lineup, Chicago might finally be heading in the right direction.\n\n\"They played great basketball, man,\" Bulls point guard Derrick Rose said of a bench group that outscored the Raptors' second unit 51-27. \"That was, I think, the difference in the game, the way that they came out and played. It seemed like they knew where the ball was going, who was going to have the ball, and it looked more organized.\"\n\nTony Snell tied for the team lead in scoring after posting 22 points coming off the bench. AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast\n\nFirst-year head coach Fred Hoiberg rode Snell, Brooks, Portis and Gibson down the stretch, as the Bulls did something they haven't done much of all year: close down the game. The most impressive part of the final 12 minutes was that Snell played the entire time and hit big shot after big shot. Snell has struggled all year to find his rhythm and was benched last week in favor of Mirotic. But Snell played arguably the best game of his three-year career on Monday as teammates continued to find him in key moments.\n\n\"Just trying to read the game,\" Snell said. \"I was feeling it really, really early, so I was just trying to make plays out there.\"\n\nTo understand how out of nowhere Snell's performance was, consider that he came into the game having scored just 15 points over his past six games. Hoiberg praised Snell's attitude of late, and his teammates seemed genuinely happy for his success.\n\n\"Just played aggressive, man,\" Rose said of Snell. \"Making the right move, attacking, not thinking that much and you could tell the offense made him shoot so we was just happy that he took the shots that he took and he hit a majority of them.\"\n\nWhile Snell has been hesitant to shoot at times this season, the same cannot be said for rookie Portis. The Arkansas alum has taken his chance at rotation minutes and has run with it. Portis plays with no fear and is always looking for his shot. His 12 points and nine rebounds were just more signs that he deserves to be in the rotation for good. Even when Joakim Noah (shoulder) comes back on the floor, Hoiberg must find a way to keep Portis out there because his teammates respond to his energy.\n\n\"I just let the game come to me,\" Portis said. \"It's not about scoring, rebounding or anything; I just want to win.\"\n\nThe Bulls need these kind of performances from the entire roster, and they could use several more from Brooks as the streaky shooter tries to show that he can play more consistent minutes night to night. Brooks is always good for a few of these games each season, but it will be up to him to show that Monday's 17 points were more than just a flash in the pan.\n\n\"We have a bunch of looks,\" Brooks said with a laugh. \"We have a bunch of looks on this team, and you never know on any given day. Tony stepped up [tonight]. There's a lot of talent of this team. Guys just got to step up when their name is called.\"", "2015 Fighter of the year": "In 2013, Canelo Alvarez, Mexico's biggest boxing star, turned back a stiff challenge from Austin Trout to win a decision and unify two junior middleweight belts but then lost them, along with his undefeated record, by decision to Floyd Mayweather in a fight that generated more money than any boxing match in history, other than Mayweather's fight against Manny Pacquiao in May.\n\nDespite the loss, Alvarez had arrived as a money-making machine. The fight with Trout had drawn a crowd of some 40,000 to the Alamodome in San Antonio and Alvarez's presence in the fight with Mayweather was the major reason it generated around $150 million.\n\nRafael's Fighters of the Year 2015: Canelo Alvarez\n\n2014: Terence Crawford\n\n2013: Floyd Mayweather\n\n2012: Nonito Donaire\n\n2011: Andre Ward\n\n2010: Sergio Martinez\n\n2009: Manny Pacquiao\n\n2008: Manny Pacquiao\n\n2007: Floyd Mayweather\n\n2006: Manny Pacquiao\n\n2005: Ricky Hatton\n\n2004: Glen Johnson\n\n2003: James Toney\n\n2002: Vernon Forrest\n\n2001: Bernard Hopkins\n\n2000: Felix Trinidad\n\nAlvarez would go on to headline smaller pay-per-views in 2014 against Alfredo Angulo and Erislandy Lara, doing solid business in the 300,000-plus buy range as he won both fights.\n\nBut in 2015, the 25-year-old Alvarez (46-1-1, 32 KOs), who signed an exclusive contract with HBO in late 2014, really came into his own both in terms of his ability as a fighter and as the face of boxing in the post Mayweather-Pacquiao era.\n\nAlvarez not only showed he was one of the best fighters in the ring -- he won the lineal middleweight championship from a future Hall of Famer -- but also continued to show he is a financial rainmaker outside of it, the fulcrum on which so much boxing business rests, and that is why he is the 2015 ESPN.com fighter of the year.\n\n\"Canelo has been fighting for 10 years now, but he's still only 25 years old,\" Golden Boy promoter Oscar De La Hoya said of his company's most important fighter. \"I think the best is yet to come with him. He has grown as a fighter every year, learning from victories and his losses. Legacy is important to him, and when all is said and done, I know he will be remembered as one of the best in the sport.\"\n\nCanelo Alvarez, left, won the middleweight championship from Miguel Cotto to finish an excellent year. AP Photo/John Locher\n\nAlvarez, who won both of his 2015 bouts, opened his campaign on May 9 against power brawler James Kirkland at Minute Maid Park in Houston, where a raucous crowd of 31,588 watched as they engaged in a thrilling shootout, one Alvarez won by monstrous third-round knockout in a terrific performance.\n\nThen Alvarez got a shot at middleweight champion Miguel Cotto, one of the best fighters of his time. They met on Nov. 21 at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas in a heavily hyped fight that delivered action and excitement and took its rightful place in the pantheon of the great Mexico versus Puerto Rico rivalry.\n\nIn the end, Alvarez, the first ESPN.com prospect of the year (2010) to also win fighter of the year honors, won a unanimous decision in another strong performance -- in the ring as well as at the box office, where it generated 900,000 pay-per-view buys, the first time a fight had done that much business without the presence of Mayweather, Pacquiao or De La Hoya since 2002.\n\nAnd this could be just the beginning. Alvarez's fan base is as big as ever, so he could earn millions against lesser opponents but that's not who he is. He wants to please the fans and also test himself against the best. He has proven his willingness to do that by already facing Cotto, Mayweather and Lara, and 2016 promises more with an expected fall unification showdown against Gennady Golovkin.\n\n\"It's very important for me to fight the best because I want to cement my legacy,\" Alvarez said. \"I came to this sport to fight the very best out there and that's a goal of mine.\n\n\"You'll get recognition by the fans, the media and the fighters themselves. Everybody knows my style of fighting and everyone knows that I love to please the fans in the arena and the viewers watching me on television.\"\n\nThat is what Alvarez did in 2015.\n\nOther contenders\n\n2.

AP Photo/Rich Schultz\n\nIn 2015, GGG (34-0, 31 KOs) made three dominant middleweight title defenses (including unifying two belts) as he extended his knockout streak to 21 and moved to 15 consecutive defenses to pass Hall of Famer Carlos Monzon into second place for most in division history, only five away from tying the great Bernard Hopkins' record of 20 in a row. In February, boxing's good boy took apart longtime contender Martin Murray for an 11th-round knockout in a one-sided fight. In May, he took on tricky southpaw Willie Monroe Jr. and blasted him out in six dominant rounds. Golovkin culminated the year in October when he brutalized David Lemieux in an eighth-round KO to unify two belts and set the stage for a 2016 showdown with champion Canelo Alvarez.\n\n3.

John GursinskiAFP/Getty Images\n\nMayweather (49-0, 26 KOs), the longtime pound-for-pound king retired from boxing (for now) with a perfect record having scored his biggest victory in 2015. After years of will-they-or-won't-they, he and Manny Pacquiao finally squared off in May in the richest fight in boxing history and one of the most hyped fights ever. It didn't come close to living up to expectations, but Mayweather did what he always does -- thoroughly outbox Pacquiao to win a decision as he unified welterweight titles. In his career coda, Mayweather took the path of least resistance and ran roughshod over Andre Berto for the completely expected easy decision in what he said was his career finale.\n\n4. Tyson Fury\n\nTyson Fury won the heavyweight championship by outpointing Wladimir Klitschko in a big upset. Lars Baron/Getty Images\n\nIn February, British big man Fury (25-0, 18 KOs) scored an eighth-round knockout of Christian Hammer in a tune-up fight for his mandatory shot at heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko in November. Forget the Hammer fight though. Fury makes the list because despite it being a dreadful fight in which neither man looked good, he won the heavyweight championship from Klitschko by unanimous decision in the upset of the year. Fury's victory ended Klitschko's 9\u00bd-year title reign (second-best all time) and stopped his defense streak of 18 successful defenses in a row (third-best all time).\n\n5. Roman Gonzalez\n\nRoman Gonzalez demolished veteran Brian Viloria in October at Madison Square Garden in New York. Ed Mulholland/K2 Promotions\n\nReigning flyweight champion Gonzalez (44-0, 38 KOs), a former strawweight and junior flyweight titleholder, enjoyed a breakout 2015 in which the all-around talented \"Chocolatito\" went from hidden treasure known in his home country of Nicaragua, Japan (where his promoter Teiken is based) and to the most ardent fans to the universally recognized pound-for-pound king following Floyd Mayweather's retirement. That recognition was due in large part to Gonzalez's first wide U.S. exposure on HBO, where he appeared on two Gennady Golovkin undercards in sensational performances. In February, in a nontitle fight in Nicaragua, Gonzalez crushed journeyman Valentin Leon in three rounds. Then he scored two impressive wins in title defenses, in his HBO debut against former junior flyweight titlist Edgar Sosa, whom he obliterated in two rounds in May, followed by a one-sided ninth-round thrashing of former unified titleholder Brian Viloria.", "NHL -- Los Angeles Kings back to leading the pack out West": "Barry Melrose and Scott Burnside discuss why the L.A. Kings are such a force in the Pacific Division all of a sudden. (5:10)\n\nTORONTO -- When I last visited with the Los Angeles Kings, it was training camp in September, about as surreal a camp as there was around the NHL.\n\nThe Kings, at the time, were turning the page on a season from hell, both on and off the ice. And the organization introduced some major off-ice initiatives to educate its player on drug abuse and domestic violence.\n\nOn the ice, they were embarrassed by having missed the playoffs last season after winning two Cups in the previous three seasons and were looking to prove they were still among the elite clubs in the NHL.\n\nIn short, there were a lot of questions surrounding this team at camp, and we're beginning to see the early answers.\n\nThe Kings look to be on the road back. Their 20-10-2 record is giving them an eight-point lead in the Pacific Division and making them look very much like a team with the potential to go far this spring.\n\n\"I think a lot of guys learned a lot from last year,\" captain Dustin Brown said over the weekend at Air Canada Centre before his team capped a six-game Eastern swing (3-2-1) with a 5-0 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs. \"We started off 0-3 and since then we haven't lost more than two games in a row. I think that [was] a big issue for us last year, we had two or three stretches where we didn't win a game for four-, five- or six-game stretches. I think we've done better this year catching it before it slides into a streak. If you can do that over the course of 82 games, that goes a long way putting us where we need to be.\"\n\nThe Kings stuck together to put last season's problems behind them. Debora Robinson/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nIndeed, when the Kings started 0-3-0 this season, people wondered if this was last season all over again. But they've since gone 20-7-2, their top players absolutely being their top players when it comes to Drew Doughty, Jonathan Quick, Jeff Carter and Anze Kopitar.\n\nOne of the many questions at camp was the issue of leadership. Who would fill that void created when Robyn Regehr, Justin Williams, Mike Richards and Jarret Stoll exited, one season after Willie Mitchell also left?\n\nThat's a lot of leadership out of the dressing room door. The onus from management was on Doughty, Kopitar and Quick, in particular, to take greater ownership in this area and transition the team's leadership into their hands.\n\n\"Obviously you miss those guys, but it's an opportunity for others,\" Brown said of all the veterans no longer on the team. \"I think Drew has just been itching to take on more of a leadership role and he has done that. With some big voices leaving, you saw a collective push, and that's how it's always been for us, it's never been one guy. It's always been a group of guys and that's part of what makes us able to get through some stretches where we're not on top of our game. We have a group mentality, we're in this together.\"\n\nThe leadership void is no more, Doughty said.\n\n\"That's not an issue,\" he said. \"We've had some of the young guys step up in that category. Our leadership on this team, I think is phenomenal. We have so many guys that could be wearing letters or whatever it may be. No matter who in the room is speaking up, everybody is listening. This group is so tight together.\"\n\nNo question Doughty has been relishing this opportunity to become a bigger voice on this team. The outspoken 26-year-old is such a breath of fresh air in a league where so many players carefully filter their thoughts so as not to bring attention on themselves or rock the boat.\n\n\"I'm one of the most competitive guys I think ever,\" Doughty said Saturday. \"I don't want to lose games. It's not always about winning games. I love winning, obviously, but I absolutely hate losing. When big games come and it's a do-or-die situation, I know I need to raise my level of play and play my best game, and usually I'm able to do that.\"\n\nBelieve me when I say he's not bragging, he's just stating plain as fact how he feels.\n\nDrew Doughty and Jonathan Quick have been asked to take on bigger leadership roles this season. Harry How/Getty Images\n\nAnother example of Doughty not being shy about walking into a minefield was last Monday in Ottawa when the conversation with media revolved around his comparison to two-time Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson of the Ottawa Senators. Doughty -- who has never won a Norris -- was asked if he thought he was getting enough love when it came to the voting for the award for the top defenseman.\n\n\"I don't know. It's hard to say,\" Doughty said. \"I guess last year some guys just left me off their ballot completely, so I don't see how that's possible. I don't know. I think if I was playing in the East, I would have had a little more love. What can you do?\"\n\nDoughty was runner-up to Karlsson for the Norris last season and, while I think the all-world Karlsson certainly deserves the hardware he's collected, it is a bit puzzling that Doughty has yet to win the Norris (it's worth noting that Karlsson helped carry the Sens into the playoffs with a late-season push last season while the Kings just missed out on the postseason).\n\nI asked Leafs head coach Mike Babcock, who coached Doughty on two Olympic teams, whether playing on the West Coast hurt Doughty's profile.\n\n\"I don't know the answer to that, he's doing alright out West, isn't he?\" responded Babcock. \"He's got two Cups, doesn't he? I think he's got a couple of gold medals, doesn't he? He's doing OK.\"\n\nBabcock has been enamored with Doughty ever since as a 21-year-old Doughty shined on the Olympic stage at the 2010 Vancouver Games.\n\n\"He's a really, really, really good player,\" said Babcock. \"He's a good kid, he knows how to play right. The bigger the game, the better he plays. He can stickhandle in a phone booth ... he doesn't mind drilling you the odd time, he's a real hockey player. He likes it and has fun with it.\"\n\nThe love affair is reciprocal.\n\n\"I love Babs as a coach, he's very demanding as a coach, he tells you exactly what he wants,\" Doughty said. \"If you do exactly what he wants, your team is going to be successful. He's a great coach. He can turn [Toronto] around.\"\n\nDrew Doughty is setting the example for his young defensive partner, Brayden McNabb. Harry How/Getty Images\n\nPerhaps most impressive by Doughty is that he's been paired this season with 24-year-old Brayden McNabb, who is playing in his second full NHL season, which puts the onus on the Kings' No. 1 blueliner to help shield McNabb as he goes through the ups and downs of learning to be a top-four blueliner.\n\nDoughty's former partner, Jake Muzzin, has been terrific while paired with Alec Martinez.\n\nWhile McNabb has mostly been fine, there are enough dips in his game that I think the Kings know it would be a huge boost in their quest to contend to get another top-four blueliner for insurance before the Feb. 29 trade deadline.\n\nIn particular, I would suggest a right-handed shot, so that the lefty-lefty Muzzin-Martinez pair could be broken up and the Kings could go lefty-righty in their top four.\n\nAnd I tell you, the guy that would be a perfect fit is Dustin Byfuglien, if the Winnipeg Jets can't re-sign him and put him on the trade market. One of the problems for the Kings, though, is that it doesn't have a first-round pick (which would be more enticing to the Jets) for the June draft -- that pick belongs to the Carolina Hurricanes from last season's Andrej Sekera trade. So if and when Byfuglien becomes available, the Kings would have to be more creative in going after him, if indeed they do at all pursue him.\n\nUntil then, there's no reason they won't keep humming above the rest of the Pacific Division. Life is good again in L.A.", "Players keep in playing, Serena keeps on winning": "The tennis season might be over, but that's not stopping players from competing on the court. That's one of a handful of topics we discuss in this week's Racket Response.\n\nWhen is enough enough?\n\nSajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPeter Bodo, ESPN.com: Tennis players have historically complained, often bitterly, about their sport's lack of an offseason. Their response lately has been the somewhat puzzling decision to ... play more tennis in the paltry few weeks that once passed for their fleeting winter break.\n\nTake the WTA. The tour theoretically goes dark when the folks in Singapore (or wherever the WTA Championships are decided) flick off the stadium lights after the final match. But did you notice Venus Williams was among the stars who won a tournament AFTER the conclusion of the nominal \"year-end championships?\"\n\nFurthermore, the WTA also staged a four-tournament series following the Singapore shootout, and it wasn't for struggling youngsters testing the pro waters, either. Among the winners: veterans Yaroslava Shvedova and Yanina Wickmayer. That run extended the WTA season by a month -- to the end of November -- which put the women right where the ATP men ended up (the Davis Cup final wrapped on Nov. 29).\n\nThe extension brought men and women to parity, and right up to the start of year two of International Premier Tennis League play.\n\nYou can laugh and ask yourself what the harm is. After all, the IPTL is just an exhibition; the players are in no danger of overexertion and they collect massive paychecks for doing very little. But it's still travel, and it's still swinging a racket, doing press, fulfilling obligations.\n\nHere's what that traditionalist Roger Federer, who plays for the UAE Royals of the IPTL, somewhat surprisingly said about the league in a news conference the other day.\n\n\"The question is what is an exhibition? There is a kids' day exhibition in Australia -- Nickelodeon-style, obviously, where you hit and giggle with Scooby Doo, you know. This is not Scooby Doo, so clearly we are playing serious tennis. You have 15,000 people [here] who are serious about tennis.\"\n\nFederer has demonstrated he has the resources, physical ability and circumstances to juggle an 11\u00bd-month tennis schedule despite being 34 years old. But perhaps he, like the others, is also tempting fate by ignoring the benefits to be had from a significant offseason.\n\nExhibition matters\n\nKarim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCarl Bialik, FiveThirtyEight.com: Roger Federer says that despite no rankings points and with no official hardware at stake, the IPTL, the annual tennis exhibition series spread throughout various parts of Asia, matters to him.\n\nBut really, he has many more meaningful things to play for. It's the retirees who should be taking this event seriously.\n\nTake, for instance, Fabrice Santoro, who has a good opportunity to settle scores from his tour days. The 5-foot-10 Frenchman with the two-handed forehand slice and just about any other quirky shot, was a crowd favorite in his playing days. He was aptly nicknamed \"The Magician\" before he retired in 2010. Santoro had more doubles success than singles, where he peaked at No. 17 in the world. He had losing records against most fellow retirees in the IPTL. But Santoro's skills haven't eroded, which has paid off for his IPTL team, the first-place Indian Aces.\n\nSo far, Santoro is 6-2 and has won nearly two-thirds of games, which is important for the format that is decided by the team that wins more games. He bageled 1999 Australian Open finalist Thomas Enqvist on Monday and won 6-2 two weeks ago against Marat Safin, the only legend in the league who has won more than one Grand Slam title.\n\nSafin looks like he has spent more time in the Russian parliament lately than the court, despite the occasional seniors tour appearances. But he hasn't lost his competitive fire or anger. However, we can't say the same of his playing level -- or so his 0-4 record would indicate.\n\nOn the flip side, Mark Philippoussis, who reached two Grand Slam finals, has looked as sharp as ever.\n\nThe players are showcasing their net play and, for some, one-handed backhands that have declined in popularity from their tour days. Let's hope the IPTL -- and competitor Champions Tennis League, which featured ex-pros such as Thomas Muster and Alex Corretja -- adds women legends to their formats next year.\n\nSerena grabs top honors\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nCarl Bialik, FiveThirtyEight.com: This year, Sports Illustrated changed the name of its annual award from Sportsman to Sportsperson of the Year. Nine women and one women's team -- the 1999 U.S. women's World Cup winners -- have won the award since its inception in 1954.\n\nBut although no basketball, hockey, softball or soccer player has won the award, tennis players have three, including two solo winners: Billie Jean King (with John Wooden) in 1972, Chris Evert in 1976 and Serena Williams, who was named the 2015 winner Monday.\n\nThose three women are American, as is every Sportswoman of the Year from other sports (track and field is second to tennis with two awards). As a matter of fact, only nine previous winners haven't been American. Some non-Americans have come close, though: Martina Navratilova went 86-1 in 1983, and Steffi Graf came up short after her Golden Slam -- all four majors and Olympic gold -- in 1988.\n\nFor a men's tennis player to win, it's also helped to be an American -- but it's been far from sufficient. Not only have Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic been shut out, but American greats John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras never won. The only man in tennis to win the award was Arthur Ashe, who is a Hall of Famer, but never had a season comparable to Federer et al.\n\nAshe won the award in 1992, 11 years after he retired, and was cited largely for his off-court humanitarian work.", "Denver Broncos, Brock Osweiler block out the noise in overtime win": "Brock Osweiler talks to Lisa Salters after the Broncos find a way to defeat the Bengals and reach the playoffs. (1:00)\n\nDENVER -- There is also the long-held belief that nothing shreds a team\u2019s hopes and dreams like uncertainty at quarterback.\n\nThe Broncos have lived with uncertainty at that position from the moment Peyton Manning limped to the sideline in the third quarter of the Broncos\u2019 Nov. 15 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nBrock Osweiler made his sixth consecutive start in Manning\u2019s place Monday night and got his fourth win, 20-17, over the Cincinnati Bengals in overtime. Osweiler showed plenty of old-school composure to help the team recover from a fourth-quarter fumble by running back C.J. Anderson and a missed field goal by Brandon McManus on the last play of regulation. He led the Broncos to their fifth consecutive playoff bid.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear it, I don\u2019t read the newspaper, I don\u2019t turn on ESPN, I don\u2019t turn on the NFL Network,\" Osweiler said. \u201cA coach once told me, no offense to anybody, close your ears and focus on your job ... This isn\u2019t about Peyton, this isn\u2019t about myself, this is about this football team.\"\n\nIt wasn't pretty at times, but Brock Osweiler and the Broncos blocked everything out and gutted out another big victory. AP Photo/Jack Dempsey\n\nBroncos coach Gary Kubiak said: \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that\u2019s part of growing up. If you\u2019re going to be a good player in this league, you have to be able to block out noise and play. That\u2019s just part of it, I think he\u2019s done a great job of that, the team had done a great job of that.\"\n\nThe Broncos have won three overtime games this season, including over the Patriots and Bengals -- both in the AFC playoff field -- with Osweiler behind center. It is the fourth consecutive season they have won at least 11 games, and with a win in the regular-season finale Sunday against the San Diego Chargers, the Broncos will win their fifth consecutive AFC West title.\n\nStill, they entered Monday\u2019s game not having scored a point in the second half of three consecutive games. Manning hasn\u2019t played in six weeks and still leads the league in interceptions with 17.\n\nIn their first-half work against the Pittsburgh Steelers and in wins over the Green Bay Packers and the Patriots, the Broncos look like a championship-caliber team. In the second half against the Steelers, the first half Monday night or in any part of their loss to the Oakland Raiders, Denver looked like it'd be watching the playoffs from their couch instead of participating.\n\nDown 14-3 at halftime and in danger losing their ability to control their playoff positioning, Kubiak treated Osweiler like the starting quarterback. Looking to kick-start the offense, Kubiak spread out the formation, put three wide receivers in the game much of the time and put the game in Osweiler\u2019s hands.\n\nAnd the 25-year-old, who waited 43 months to start first NFL game, was up to the task.\n\n\u201cWe have to do something so I said, \u2018Let\u2019s just go to two-minute, Brock will handle the team',\" Kubiak said.\n\n\u201cOnce we got into it, let\u2019s stay with it ... just impressed how Brock handled the group.\"\n\nManning continues to work feverishly to try to get back on the field -- he hinted in a Sunday interview with ESPN he might be ready to play Sunday \u201cif needed\" and is expected to be back in practice this week. Manning is Manning, a Mount Rushmore-type player who has earned piles of respect in a Hall of Fame career. Osweiler is an up-and-comer who\u2019s had a taste of playing and wants to keep on playing.\n\nHe\u2019s also a guy who has earned his teammates\u2019 respect. Or as wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders put it Monday: \u201cBrock\u2019s not a backup quarterback. Obviously this whole quarterback controversy, I try to keep my hands out of it, keep my mouth out of it, my job is to show up and catch touchdowns and make plays.\"\n\nManning still has not shown he\u2019s healthy enough to play. When he does, what happens next is the elephant-sized question that looms for the Broncos.\n\n\u201cWe just play, man,\" cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. \u201cThis team will go play anywhere, everybody in this locker room, we just want to win and I don\u2019t think anything can stop that. This team can handle what comes.\"\n\nThat point is hard to argue against.", "Heavyweights Luis Ortiz and Bryant Jennings looking to make a statement": "VERONA, N.Y. -- Tyson Fury's massive upset of long-reigning heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko on Nov. 28 turned boxing's glamour division on its ear as he wrested control of it after a decade in Klitschko's iron grip.\n\nFury is now the champ -- although he is headed to a rematch with Klitschko next -- while others look to make the case that they are the best.\n\nLuis Ortiz-Bryant Jennings TV lineup for Golden Boy's card Saturday on HBO (10:15 p.m. ET/PT) and HBO Latino (approximately 12:15 a.m. ET/PT) from the Turning Stone Resort Casino in Verona, N.Y.: Heavyweights: Luis Ortiz (23-0, 20 KOs) vs. Bryant Jennings (19-1, 10 KOs), 12 rounds, for Ortiz's interim title Junior lightweights: Nicholas Walters (26-0, 21 KOs) vs. Jason Sosa (18-1-3, 14 KOs), 10 rounds *Light heavyweights: Yunieski Gonzalez (16-1, 12 KOs) vs. Vyacheslav Shabranskyy (14-0, 12 KOs), 10 rounds *Middleweights: Gabriel Rosado (21-9, 13 KOs) vs. Joshua Clottey (39-4, 22 KOs), 10 rounds *Lightweights: Yuriorkis Gamboa (24-1, 17 KOs) vs. Hylon Williams Jr. (16-1-1, 3 KOs), 10 rounds *HBO Latino fight on slight tape delay\n\nThere is titleholder Deontay Wilder, who defends his belt against Artur Szpilka next month.

I'm winning this fight.\"\n\nJennings (19-1, 10 KOs), 31, of Philadelphia, who comes into the fight having parted ways with trainer Fred Jenkins and moving his training camp to Florida to work with John David Jackson, watched Klitschko-Fury. He was entirely unimpressed like most who saw it.\n\n\"I watched the fight live and I was throwing up,\" Jennings said. \"It was, 'Oh my God, it was the worst fight in the heavyweight history.' I swear to God it was the worst fight in heavyweight championship history.\"\n\nIt was a difficult fight to watch and Gary Shaw, Jennings' promoter, said Saturday's fight will be far more crowd-pleasing.\n\n\"It's going to definitely be more entertaining,\" Shaw said. \"I believe Bryant's going to win this fight, but even if Ortiz won the fight, either Ortiz or Bryant would beat Tyson Fury. It shows you the state of where Klitschko is.\"\n\nEditor's Picks Jennings, Ortiz undergoing VADA drug testing\n\nWalters looks to make big impression at 130 pounds Former featherweight titlist Nicholas Walters believes he can still make 126 pounds for the right opponent. Until then he'll bide his time at junior lightweight on Saturday against Jason Sosa. 1 Related\n\nOrtiz (23-0, 20 KOs), 36, a bull-strong Cuban defector fighting out of Miami, won the vacant interim belt by blasting out no-hoper Matias Ariel Vidondo in three rounds Oct. 17 on the Gennady Golovkin-David Lemieux undercard. The bout was his third since a first-round knockout of Lateef Kayode to win the interim belt in 2014 in a result that was erased after Ortiz tested positive for a banned steroid and was fined and suspended. He has put the incident behind him and has his own designs on taking over the division.\n\n\"This is the new era of the heavyweight division, and I am in the running to become the best in the world,\" said Ortiz, who is a southpaw. \"I feel like I have the conditioning to become a world champion. I have the power, speed and intelligence in the ring.\n\n\"I am ready physically and mentally for this fight, and I am going to come out to destroy my opponent. I have not been able to show off my condition and preparation in my last few fights, and this is my opportunity to show the world that I am the best. I have been ready for a world championship fight for three years and am ready for to go 15 rounds if needed. I'm coming for that No. 1 spot. I didn't come over here from Cuba to sit back and not work.\"\n\nJennings, however, took a shot at Ortiz's thin resume.\n\n\"This is Ortiz's first fight, this is his first real fight,\" he said. \"If you go down the line of his resume then you will see no other fighter that could even come close to a person of my stature, so this is Ortiz's first real fight as a professional.\n\n\"He hasn't faced nobody like me. Which one of (the) top 10 fighters that he fought, and I will wait. I can wait, I will wait until 5:00, just name me one. I will wait. He hasn't. So this guy has to humble himself.\"\n\nWhomever wins will put himself in a great position in the suddenly up-for-grabs division.\n\n\"(The fight) features two talented individuals in the heavyweight division, two top-ranked individuals, and it just brings a different type of attention because people will say, 'OK, well the (Klitschko-Fury) fight was BS so let's see with these guys have going, because these are the next guys up.'\n\n\"And you know I'm quite sure that they are definitely going to see something and I'm hoping that Ortiz definitely backs up everything that he says to be able to bring the tough fight. We're going to put on a show and make sure that either one of us -- win, lose, or draw -- would be a main attraction and all that momentum from the BS from (Klitschko-Fury) will shift to us as a positive momentum.\"", "A victory for Donald Cerrone could lead to shot at Conor McGregor": "Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone wasn't even three hours into his road trip to a title fight at Saturday's UFC on FOX card in Orlando, Florida, when his notorious RV broke down on the side of the road.\n\nYou'd like to think most fighters, if their RV broke down on the way to the biggest fight of their life, would leave the thing behind and either take a car the rest of the way or book the soonest flight. That's a hard statement to make though, as most fighters wouldn't take an RV to the biggest fight of their life in the first place.\n\nUFC: Rafael dos Anjos-Donald Cerrone Where: Amway Center, Orlando, Florida\n\nWhen: Saturday\n\nTV: FOX, 8 p.m. ET\n\nRiding \"the bus\" to an event is a longtime tradition for Cerrone though, and when the old girl broke down Sunday evening he didn't seem too upset by it. Cerrone and his crew shacked up at a local mechanic's shop in a small Alabama town and spent the next 24 hours fixing the RV themselves. On Tuesday morning, he proudly drove the RV into Orlando.\n\n\"My phone was going crazy that night,\" Cerrone told ESPN.com. \"I had grease all over my hands trying to answer it, people telling me to just leave it where it was. This is what I do, man. I'm a hillbilly. I'm in my RV and this is my journey. I'm not dwelling on it. I just roll with the punches. It rents no space in my mind. It did cost me $6,000 though, so I guess it rented some space in my bank account.\"\n\nCerrone (28-6) fights Rafael dos Anjos for the UFC's 155-pound championship Saturday at Amway Center. He enters the title bout as one of the hottest fighters in the sport right now, riding an eight-fight win streak.\n\nIt's remarkable to think before this streak began, Cerrone contemplated retiring from MMA. In November 2013, Cerrone was coming off his second loss in three fights and was scheduled to face Evan Dunham at UFC 167 in Las Vegas.\n\nBefore the event, Cerrone stopped at his grandfather's grave and told the man who raised him that if he didn't beat Dunham, that would be his last fight. That fire to compete hadn't been present in recent camps. Maybe he was burnt out.\n\n\"I remember kickboxing and traveling the world when I was young,\" Cerrone said. \"I would go to Japan or Africa and I would go for the experience. As soon as I got off the plane, we'd go have a good time, party. Fighting was just the outlet of what I was doing there. When I signed with the WEC [in 2007], that's when s--- changed. I started thinking, This is what I'm actually doing with my life now. I should take it more serious. I had coaches telling me to get serious.\n\nUFC lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos, right, defeated Donald Cerrone by decision during their first meeting in 2013. Ed Mulholland/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\n\"That Evan Dunham fight, I went back to not being serious. I was going to the lake and literally brought some wrestling mats down with me. We have a shop at the lake where we park the boat. I'd throw the mats in there, wakeboard all day and train all night. I was having a good time, getting back to work.\"\n\nDuring that camp, Cerrone reunited with muay Thai coach Henry Smith, whom he worked with earlier in his MMA career. Since restarting his work with Smith and wrestling coach Jafari Vanier, Cerrone hasn't lost.\n\n\"That's when the name BMF Ranch [Cerrone's camp in Edgewood, New Mexico] really started,\" Cerrone said. \"I got back to having a good time, playing. Doing what I love.\"\n\nDos Anjos, 31, believes that's where he holds an edge against Cerrone. The Brazilian subscribes to the the exact training regiment that didn't work out for Cerrone -- his focus never wavers.\n\nIn the buildup to the fight, Cerrone has questioned changes in dos Anjos' physique and mentioned he's happy this fight is taking place under the UFC's new anti-doping policy. When asked to clarify his stance this week, Cerrone said, \"If you look at a picture of him before and then when he fought [Anthony] Pettis [in March] -- you're a grown a-- man. You let your own eyes do the judging.\"\n\nDos Anjos, who has never failed a drug test, feels Cerrone's comments suggest a lack of confidence.\n\n\"He's trying to make himself confident with these allegations,\" Dos Anjos said. \"Maybe he's trying to get in my mind, but I've never seen him do this to anyone else. I'm in the gym training every day. I take my job serious. If you're not dedicated or training hard, you're always going to be in second place. That's why I have the belt. I've had four months of focus in training camp. I don't see anything going wrong on Saturday.\"\n\nFor Saturday's winner, a potential mega-fight against newly crowned featherweight champion Conor McGregor (19-2) looms. Last weekend, McGregor unified the 145-pound title and has expressed interest in moving up and challenging for the lightweight title.\n\nThat fight would represent either Cerrone or dos Anjos' biggest payday. \"Cowboy\" wants that fight, but says his focus right now is on the rematch.\n\n\"This is my response to Conor,\" Cerrone said. \"I've got an a-- to whip on Saturday. After that, I'll talk all the Conor talk you guys want. I keep getting people tell me I'm sidetracked. I'm not. I'm coming to win that belt.\"", "Q&A: Los Angeles Dodgers president Stan Kasten values flexibility": "A bizarre series of setbacks to the Los Angeles Dodgers' plans has led, thus far, to what some fans consider a disconcerting quiet in Southern California. Aside from seeing Brett Anderson accept the team's $15.8 million qualifying offer and re-signing veteran infielder Chase Utley, the team has done nothing to generate headlines this winter. The Dodgers have stayed out of free agency and, thus far, failed to swing any trades for obvious 2016 upgrades.\n\nThe team had a deal to acquire flamethrowing closer Aroldis Chapman from the Cincinnati Reds only to see that scuttled, at least for the moment, by an MLB investigation into a domestic violence incident involving Chapman from weeks earlier. The Dodgers had a deal to acquire free-agent starter Hisashi Iwakuma only to see something crop up in the physical and for Iwakuma to return to Seattle on a one-year deal. The Dodgers didn't stretch to a sixth year for Zack Greinke and finished third in the effort to hold on to their No. 2 starter, who wound up signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nWith all that in motion, we checked in with Dodgers team president Stan Kasten about the state of the team in what looks like a transition phase.\n\nIt has been a quiet offseason thus far for the Dodgers. Can you explain the lack of activity?\n\nKasten: I understand people wanting as much good, positive, big news as early as they can get it. I totally get that, but I also know that nowadays all of us tend to overreact to everything, both good and bad. If you're feeling down right now about the Dodgers, I think it's unwarranted as well as way premature. We had all kinds of scenarios when the season ended. We did reach for some big-ticket items very early that didn't work out for various reasons.\n\nWe are going to be, at a minimum, a contending team again and maybe better than last year by the time Opening Day gets here. Even more important, we're much closer today than we were three years ago to being the long-term, self-sustaining organization, and that doesn't get enough attention. Fans look at the short-term snapshot and maybe don't have enough time to reflect on what we have been spending a lot of our time and energy and money building here in L.A. We all know the next wave of players is very close to getting to the majors this coming year. Behind them, we think two to three years from now we have a very, very deep roster of other prospects highlighted by the investments we've made internationally. There are two movements on the way and that's what we said we were trying to do from the day we arrived.\n\nIn that case, is there a disconnect between the way the Dodgers operate their baseball team, concentrating on the farm system, and the way national media and other teams think they still operate it, by throwing around money?\n\nKasten: I don't know. I do know everyone saw us make a reach for big-ticket items when that worked for us. It really only worked this offseason with the way we felt personally about Zack [Greinke]. We decided we would stretch for him. Once that didn't occur, I know our name was thrown out there on everybody. Part of that is because we do touch base with everyone and once that happens, agents can characterize that touching base however it suits their purposes. We haven't wanted any of the other big-ticket items for various reasons, from physical reasons to age to the way it was going to fit together for us. Everything we do has to make sense in the short term and in the long term. We value our flexibility now and that's only going to increase.\n\nIt seems to be accepted at this point that you finished third, after the San Francisco Giants and his eventual team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, for Greinke. Can you take us inside that?\n\nKasten: I think we were right there. We were inside the red zone for sure. I love Zack and Emily, his wife. He did what was best for him and I'm glad he is happy and comfortable. He is a great guy and was a fantastic Dodger. He should be remembered by our fans with only the best thoughts.\n\nZack Greinke made 92 starts and was 51-15 with a 2.30 ERA in three seasons with the Dodgers. AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill\n\nSome people seem stumped as to why a team with your revenue wouldn't guarantee a sixth year for a pitcher that good. Can you explain?\n\nKasten: We evaluate stuff very carefully, from performance to contracts to physical conditions to the arc of performance over various ages. We value productivity levels in free-agent contracts. All things factored in, we could not get to a point we felt hamstrung down the road. Having said that, we went beyond what we felt was strictly prudent because it was Zack, who we valued so highly. But we were prepared to move on once it went another direction.\n\nSo, do you need a No. 2 starter behind Clayton Kershaw or could you go into next season hoping one of that next wave of starting pitchers -- guys like Julio Urias or Jose De Leon -- will be ready?\n\nKasten: I always talk about the three ways of acquiring players. You can grow them yourself, you can sign them as free agents or you can make trades. All the avenues remain open. We are looking at things down all three avenues. If we can find more starting pitchers between now and Opening Day, we'll certainly do that, but I think we're going to be good either way. One of our keys last year that doesn't get talked about because I wouldn't let anyone talk about it was injuries. We used two dozen pitchers last year and that many or more position players. The system is just starting to catch up in terms of depth. I can tell you right now we have more depth than the organization has ever had. I think we're ready to see that in the regular season and beyond. I don't think the team we field today is the team we will open the postseason with next October. Things happen. I'm really excited about our growth and the whole rotation of pitchers we have knocking on the door at [Triple-A] Oklahoma City. Oh, and by the way, we haven't even talked about Brandon McCarthy or Hyun-Jin Ryu, both of whom could pitch for us next year. I just talked a couple of days ago to Ryu, who is working very, very hard here and he thinks he'll be ready for the start of spring training, even though we don't strictly need him to be.\n\nHyun-Jin Ryu had shoulder surgery in May and is \"working very, very hard,\" said Dodgers president Stan Kasten. Jake Roth/USA TODAY Sports\n\nWas [president of baseball operations] Andrew Friedman given a mandate to decrease the payroll?\n\nKasten: Let's go back to the start. Did you not see us make big offers? Don't pretend that's not there. What is important is that we continue the program we began three years ago of becoming more self-reliant on our own development. Over the course of time, becoming a younger team will be cheaper, but it will also be one that stays good longer. From the start, I said we don't make decisions by looking at payroll. I didn't know what it was going to end up being last year. We had to do some cleanup for the new administration. If you told me it would be the highest in baseball again next year, that might well be right. I just don't know yet. It's not the biggest consideration. The biggest consideration is putting winning teams on the field.\n\nIs it true there is a rift between ownership and the front office or dysfunction inside the front office, as some people have written?\n\nKasten: Man, that is bizarre. I've read that a couple places this year and, please, put that all to rest. First of all, I have no hard and fast rules other than not having any hard and fast rules. I read I have a hard and fast rule not to sign guys beyond age 36. That's b.s. When we made the trade with Boston or we traded for Hanley Ramirez or signed Andre Ethier, I said it was cool that none of them were signed beyond age 36, but it doesn't mean it's a hard and fast rule. Another thing was I don't give pitchers more than five years. I think that's a really good rule if it were one, but on the other hand, we have Clayton Kershaw here. It's silly people would actually write that.\n\nI've also read that the front office was all set to hire one managerial candidate until ownership stepped in and made them have a deeper search. That is really bizarre. Where does this stuff come from? There were no other jobs open and we had all the time in the world to interview every possible candidate, which is what we did. It came down to the last two guys and our owners met those guys and we all collectively made the same decision. That was the first time the owners were involved at any stage of the search. Rift? I've never been in a situation that was more fun and more collegial. Our owners, by the way, speak the same language as our new front office, which wouldn't be the case if they were just conventional baseball guys. We have wide-ranging, fascinating conversations. I don't know where any of that is coming from. I really don't.\n\nNow to your favorite topic: Do you have any further optimism that your channel, SportsNetLA, will be available to more homes in Southern California next season? Could the dispute with DirecTV and other carriers carry through a third season?\n\nKasten: I don't have any news, which is one reason why I don't answer questions on this every day. It got kind of silly. But there isn't a day that goes by, including earlier today, when we haven't engaged in some conversations with someone or multiple parties or companies looking to find the best path to finally get everyone access. Are there some companies that after two years of not giving their customers the Dodgers, never will? At some point you might just have to accept that, but today people should be convinced we're doing all we can. I can't talk to anything substantive, because the minute we do it gets mischaracterized and sets us further back in terms of resolution.\n\nAs hard as we have worked on the product, the team, the stadium, our community relations in the name of solidifying our core of fans, this TV thing has hurt our fans more than anything else. This problem has bothered me more than any other we have had.\n\nOnce all these mergers are final could that lead to resolution?\n\nKasten: I'm tired of predicting that, but I am hopeful. I guess we just have to see how it all works. You have new companies owning rights that have to deal with other companies that thus far didn't feel the need to provide the Dodgers to their customers. We will all see together.", "Jaguars players puttering around in the locker room": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- It doesn't take long for professional football players to take something and turn it into a contest in the locker room.\n\nTake, for example, a couple of golf balls, a putter, and a putting cup. They were an early Christmas gift from Drew Straitt, an intern on the Jacksonville Jaguars' equipment staff, to the offensive line.\n\nWhat started as a small contest between the offensive linemen to make progressively longer putts morphed into a longest putt contest that has nearly spanned the entire length of the Jaguars' locker room.\n\nThe leader, as of 3 p.m. ET Monday, was left tackle Luke Joeckel, who made a putt that paced off at approximately 78 feet -- in other words, it stretched from the offensive linemen's lockers past the running backs' lockers and into the wide receivers' area.\n\nEvery putt has been marked on the floor in masking tape with the players' name and date. Joeckel sank his on Christmas Day at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\n\"It's a pretty lucky putt, but I'll take it as skill,\" Joeckel said.\n\nThe Jaguars' 2013 first-round pick does play golf, though not during the season. He said he'll get his handicap down to around a 10 by the time training camp begins.\n\nThere are few rules to the contest, but one is that each attempt to break the current leader has to be by at least a foot. That's why left guard Zane Beadles' putt, which was two before Joeckel's mark, was disqualified. So sitting in the first three spots are Joeckel, rookie offensive lineman Chris Reed, and Kyle Tucker.\n\nQuarterback Chad Henne was the leader twice, sandwiched around a putt by long snapper Carson Tinker.\n\nSeveral players tried to best Joeckel's mark on Monday, and there was almost a controversy to rival what happened at the Solheim Cup in September. Running back T.J. Yeldon inadvertently stepped in front of a putt by tight end Ben Koyack, who at one point last week had the mark for longest putt. The ball bounced off Yeldon's shoe -- and he didn't seem too broken up about it, either.", "Taking golf's governing bodies to task over anchor ban and more": "We are just days away from Rule 14-1b regarding the anchoring of a golf stroke going into effect, some three-plus years after it came on everyone's radar.\n\nAnd I am more convinced than ever this is a bad move.\n\nNot because of the impact it will have on senior golf at every level, or championship golf, or even teaching the game. It's because of the exceptions within the rule, the lack of clarity it provides and the more important issues the ruling bodies should be focusing on rather than anchored strokes. Rule 14-1b, as officially announced in May 2013, prohibits anchoring the club either directly or by use of an anchor point in making a stroke. This is fine on the surface, but let's take a more in-depth look at the layers of this ruling and the long-term impact.\n\nWhen Keegan Bradley won the 2011 PGA Championship at the Atlanta Athletic Club, he became the first major champion on the PGA Tour to do so with a belly -- or anchored -- putter. Stuart Franklin/Getty Images\n\nFor decades, golf's ruling bodies approved of the anchored method with many of the thoughts being:\n\n1. It will be pretty much confined to senior golf (quickly proven untrue on all professional tours and top-level amateur golf around the world).\n\n2. No one will win a major championship with a long or anchored putter (see Adam Scott, Keegan Bradley, Ernie Els and others).\n\n3. No one will ever teach the anchored method to youngsters. (USGA President Tom O'Toole Jr.'s young son was encouraged to learn this method by his professional, thus sending Mr. O'Toole, by his own admission, to his breaking point to take the side of the anchoring ban.\n\nThe information about implementation of the rule on the USGA's website is seven -- yes, seven -- long pages when printed. The rule itself reads like the tax code and includes exceptions that undercut the strength of the rule, like Matt Kuchar's method of putting where he braces the putter grip against his forearm. I have yet to hear an explanation of this particular method that dissuades me from thinking it is an anchored stroke.\n\nMatt Kuchar's putting stroke, where he presses his club against his forearm, is allowable under the new rule, to the dismay of many. Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images\n\nWhy not say a player might only have up to two points of contact with the club, those points being either one or two hands? This certainly would make it much cleaner and simpler, especially when the big scream about the rules of golf (and the decisions) are centered on their complexity and difficulty to understand.\n\nFurthermore, the reversal of the previous decision and the course of action with the \"because we said so\" air undermines the authority of the ruling bodies. I applaud the current USGA and R&A leadership and committees for being more active in protecting the integrity and future of the game, but not like this.\n\nI also disagree with the USGA's announcement just prior to Thanksgiving that \"scores made while playing alone will no longer be acceptable [for] handicap purposes.\" Unless the USGA has a larger motive for a global handicapping code (the United Kingdom, among others, does not allow for solo scores to count toward handicapping), then the organization talking about making itself more inclusive has done exactly the opposite.\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, one of the biggest attractions to the game was the opportunity for solitary participation. There was no need for someone on the other side of the net to return a shot or even to practice with me. I was raised in a very average, working-class family where both parents held jobs and I played at a working-to-middle-class club just a mile from home. I could ride my bike back and forth to McGregor Links with my eyes closed and knew every blade of grass on the course.\n\nIt would have been nearly impossible to find people to play with during regular hours in order to verify my scores by \"peer review.\" Scores are needed to be eligible for entry to the local, regional and statewide competitions that paved the way for what has become an incredibly blessed life in and around the game. My life would have taken a very different course if I had to have someone sign every time I needed scores.\n\nPar and personal bests were better than any \"peer review\" I could ever imagine, my own measuring stick for my dreams of earning a college scholarship and degree, becoming a professional, a major champion and ultimately someone who is still involved in the game more than 40 years later.\n\nGood on Golf Canada for feeling much the same way and not enforcing the USGA's \"peer review\" ruling. We need to be putting ourselves in the position of growing the game at every level and not putting up more roadblocks.\n\nAs a game, golf has a number of issues that need much more attention and energy than the two just addressed, such as speed of play, green speeds, the huge distances today's golf ball travels in concert with the current club technology, and caddies lining up their players during competition.\n\nPace of play\n\nAt last month's pace-of-play symposium held at St. Andrews, Martin Slumbers, the R&A's new chief executive, said he believes it is time for the slow players at all levels to be named and shamed. Bravo!\n\nNow that is peer review that will have a positive effect.\n\nToward the end of my LPGA career, there was a regular locker room posting of all players, the number of instances they had been timed for slow play, the \"bad times\" they had racked up, as well as any fines levied. Talk about a list you didn't want to be on or a check you didn't want to write!\n\nThat was a powerful, positive motivator to pick up the pace and could be used nearly anywhere to get people moving quicker.\n\nGreen speeds\n\nIn the past three majors held at St. Andrews -- including Zach Johnson's victory in July -- the tournament was delayed because winds were so strong that golf balls would oscillate and some would start rolling off the greens. Ross Kinnaird/R&A/Getty Images\n\nNo greater example of green speeds getting out of control (golf is not played in a dome, after all) came on the Old Course at St. Andrews during July's Open Championship. For the third straight time (the last two Opens and the 2013 Ricoh Women's British Open), a major championship held on the Old Course was suspended because golf balls could not be put into play or kept in play without moving due to the conditions Mother Nature presented.\n\nThis might be a reach, but why not have a conversation between those who conduct the four major championships about a maximum allowed speed for a two-year cycle? Do the research, analyze the results. Let's propose 9 feet on the stimpmeter for seaside courses and 10.5 for less exposed inland courses.\n\nWhat players really want aren't necessarily fast greens, but rather true and consistent greens.\n\nAgronomic practices and turf grass technology have come so far that sometimes we've really outthought ourselves. In the process, we've decreased playability, lowered the number and variety of available hole locations and have driven up the time of the round by sweating over treacherously fast 3-and-4 footers.\n\nGolf ball go far\n\nThe overall statistics might not say it, but I can promise you in the 12 years I have covered live golf, the ball travels much farther than ever. Sadly, in combination with today's metal woods and stronger iron lofts, the ability to conduct major championships on classic sites without acquiring more land and resorting to trickery and compromise is quickly shrinking.\n\nI use Oak Hill Country Club's East Course as a prime example. Before hosting its past two PGA Championships, the club had to purchase additional property to stretch the 17th hole to a 501-yard par-4, hoping the players would then land their drives on the fairway upslope to set up a demanding approach rather than just a short iron.\n\nLonger walks to back tees (more time), longer courses (more area and cost to maintain), more classic courses being \"tricked up\" (Merion in the 2013 U.S. Open, for example) and you might begin to see why it is time to look at reining in the ball for the top levels.\n\nLet club-level amateurs still have their fun. The game is hard enough as it is, but let's put more skill, shot-making and creativity back into ballstriking while letting the classic courses remain relevant.\n\nCaddies lining up players\n\nI was one of those players who did it for a while and thought it was helping me when, in fact, it was slowing me down while not making me take complete ownership of my shot decision or execution.\n\nLining up the shot is the player's responsibility. Period. It is part of being a golfer, part of playing the game. You can have all the help you want on the practice range, but get at it and get at it by yourself on the course. It not only looks bad to the television viewer, but also gives the impression that the player isn't in command of his or her game.\n\nScotland's Catriona Matthew has been very vocal about this issue, and I applaud her for it because it is not an easy or popular stand to take. Caddies lining up players is a much bigger threat to the integrity of the game than anchoring, as well as the other issues mentioned here.\n\nWe're all looking out for the good of the game and what we hope will be its vibrant and healthy future. A tough examination of the issues and establishing thoughtful priorities will be a win for everyone, whether they are just entering the game or playing it at the highest level.\n\nLet's hope the next four-year cycle of changes to the rules of golf does more of just that.\n\nDottie Pepper was an independent member of the PGA of America board of directors from Nov. 2012-Nov. 2015.", "Demetrious Johnson uses armbar to tap Kyoji Horiguchi": "The ESPN.com pick for submission of the year is Demetrious Johnson's armbar of Kyoji Horiguchi at UFC 186.

Then featherweight champion Conor McGregor did it one second better, knocking out Jose Aldo in 13 seconds at UFC 194.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson, 29, waited until literally the last second of his sixth flyweight title defense to put Horiguchi away, securing the tap at 4:59 of the final round.\n\nAnd you could say Horiguchi was finished already at that point, having lost every round and exhausted by Johnson's pace, but re-watch that final sequence and take in its brilliance. Johnson had Horiguchi in a crucifix, landing unanswered punches but not doing quite enough to warrant a stoppage. You can hear Johnson's head coach, Matt Hume, screaming at him to go for the armbar in the fight's final seconds.\n\nJohnson listens and in less than a second's time, he jumps to full mount, then to the armbar and produces a tap -- and a record that will never be broken.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\n2. Liam McGeary via inverted triangle choke vs. Tito Ortiz (Bellator 142 on Sept. 19)\n\nShowcasing his preference to fight off of his back, Bellator light heavyweight champion Liam McGeary submitted Tito Ortiz in Round 1 in September. Dave Mandel/Sherdog.com\n\nAnytime a very large man knows his way around the ground game it's always entertaining, and McGeary knows his way around better than most. A light heavyweight champion who prefers to fight with his back to the floor is a rare thing. McGeary's guard game is one of the most entertaining things to watch in MMA at the moment. He secured this baby in his first title defense at the end of a first round Ortiz was actually winning.\n\n3. Marcos Galvao via kneebar vs. Joe Warren (Bellator 135 on March 27)\n\nThe first submission win of Marcos Galvao's career came in March when he captured the Bellator bantamweight championship against Joe Warren. Dave Mandel/Sherdog.com\n\nIt's absolutely mind-boggling that Galvao, a world champion Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, recorded the first submission of his MMA career this year, his 12th as a professional. How does that happen? Well, his first was good enough to land him among the top subs of the year. It won him the Bellator bantamweight championship, even though Warren tried to say the fight was called too quickly. Warren never tapped, but he cried out in pain, forcing referee John McCarthy to stop the fight.\n\n4. Ronda Rousey via armbar vs. Cat Zingano (UFC 184 on Feb. 28)\n\nCat Zingano's decision to rush Ronda Rousey at the start of Round 1 ended in a 14-second defeat by armbar. Jeff Bottari/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nRousey finished 2015 with a knockout loss, but she began it with arguably her most impressive performance ever. Zingano would say afterward that no one had ever tried to beat Rousey by going directly at her so she figured she might as well try. That strategy proved to be as ineffective as all of those that came before it, as Rousey flipped Zingano over in one fluid motion and wrapped her body around Zingano's right arm.\n\n5. Charles Oliveira via guillotine choke vs. Nik Lentz (UFC Fight Night on May 30)\n\nSubmission specialist Charles Oliveira used a beautifully executed guillotine to tap out Nik Lentz in their May rematch. Buda Mendes/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images\n\nCharles Oliveira's name is always a good bet to show up on a list of top submissions. His guillotine was not the most famous of 2015 (that distinction goes to Fabricio Werdum's submission against Cain Velasquez for the UFC heavyweight championship), but with the speed and technique showcased in Oliveira's finish -- securing the choke, pulling guard, rotating into mount -- Lentz had no shot. As slick as it was, Oliveira would later hit a very similar submission against Myles Jury in December.", "Jerry Jones: Finding a QB for the Cowboys is a 'high priority'": "IRVING, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys have many needs for 2016, but owner and general manager Jerry Jones reiterated finding a quarterback is at the top of the list.\n\nBackups Brandon Weeden, Matt Cassel and Kellen Moore have combined to go 1-10 this season after starter Tony Romo suffered a broken left collarbone twice this season. Jones has acknowledged the front office handled the backup spot entering the season poorly.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to all the ways \u2013 all ways \u2013 to come up with a way to get Tony a backup, while at the same time looking toward the future,\u201d Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas on Tuesday. \u201cSome people would say that\u2019s dreaming. Everybody wants that, but we have a high draft pick, obviously. We're earned it, and we've got it. If we evaluate and get an opportunity to get a couple of players there, we got to look at it hard.\u201d\n\nJones said he had a conversation with Romo about the future of the position on Saturday night in Buffalo. He has said he believes Romo, who turns 36 in April, has a 3-5 year window left at playing at a high level.\n\nThe Cowboys have not drafted a quarterback since 2009 (Stephen McGee, fourth round) and have not selected a quarterback in the first round since Troy Aikman in 1989. They took Steve Walsh with a first-round pick in the 1989 compensatory draft as well.\n\nIt\u2019s possible the Cowboys could take a quarterback early in the draft as well as look in free agency for a veteran backup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously going to be a high priority for us, the backup situation, as it relates to not only being able to come in and do better than we did this year, but whatever way, whatever we do, do better, but we\u2019re looking to our future,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThat\u2019s as big a thing for me.\u201d", "Kevin Hart is motivating others through impromptu 5K runs.": "Editor's note: This content originally appeared at RunnersWorld.com.\n\nI started running in the past couple of years because I put a high demand on my body [doing stand-up]. I knew running was a great way to take care of myself. Now when I land in a new city every morning, I literally hit the ground running.\n\nLast summer, I decided to see how many people I could get to join me for an impromptu 5K run through social media. It started out with just 200 runners, but now it\u2019s consistently 3,000 people.\n\nI call these 5Ks races, but I don\u2019t want them to be misconstrued as real. It\u2019s not about who finishes first or last. It\u2019s about running together.\n\nI don\u2019t think people expected me to run the way I ran at the beginning. I go at about a seven-minute pace. Once I finish, I stay and high-five everybody. I do not leave until everyone has crossed the finish line.\n\nI teamed up with Nike to do these runs on a larger scale while I was on tour. The whole \u201cHustle Hart\u201d movement is real.\n\nWhat I love most is hearing why people come out. Those stories make it worth it. It\u2019s affecting people\u2019s lives. You can\u2019t do bigger or better than that.\n\nI\u2019m from Philadelphia, and that event was our biggest turnout so far. We had 5,000 people running, including my staff, my family, and my kids.\n\nWith my kids, running is contagious. It\u2019s about constantly bettering ourselves as a family.\n\nI run in every city I visit. I do a 5K whether it\u2019s a race or just the exercise. People see me and respect me when I\u2019m working out. They say hello and keep on moving.\n\nWhen I\u2019m traveling, I love to go find places while I\u2019m running where I can see things. It\u2019s about capturing moments -- capturing that city while you get your healthy side on.\n\nWhen I\u2019m running, I\u2019m not competing for a gold medal.

A typical day consists of driving her \u201csag wagon\u201d loaded with her belongings to the next segment\u2019s finish line. Then her newfound friends, who had put her up in their house the night before, will drive her back to where she\u2019d left off the day before. For the next five to six hours, she\u2019ll run the distance back to her car, carrying all the supplies she needs in a backpack.\n\nThis leap-frogging process has taken her from Ocean Beach, California, to Atlantic Beach, Florida, in 2010, from Vancouver to Tijuana, Mexico, in 2013, and from Marathon, Florida, to Maine in 2014. She\u2019s in the midst of her final leg now.\n\nFor the 54-year-old from Las Vegas, the reasons behind why she\u2019s chosen to cover a total of 9,715 miles over the course of more than 330 nonconsecutive days are deeply personal.\n\nAn 800-meter runner in high school, Neville admitted she never really considered herself a lover of long distances. That fact was true until 1998, when she signed up for the Chicago Marathon on a whim.\n\nFive years earlier, Neville was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a form of cancer that affects the immune system. In the years between her diagnosis and the day she registered for the marathon, she endured three brain surgeries and numerous rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatments.\n\n\u201cI was not in a great state of heath, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I would get better or keep having relapses,\u201d said Neville. Finishing the marathon, she said, was a means to prove her tenacity against the disease.\n\nHer weakened body was only able to muster a total of six training runs; her longest run just six miles. But on race day, she lined up anyway. She remembers standing in the corral, listening to other runners trade stories about the training they\u2019d just completed.\n\n\u201cI just stood there praying that no one would ask me what my method was,\u201d she said.\n\nAccustomed to spending eight hours on her feet at her nursing job, Neville figured she could finish in five hours.\n\nBolstered by the crowds, she crossed the line in 4:28.\n\nCome the following summer, Neville was in remission. To make sure Chicago wasn\u2019t \u201ca fluke,\u201d she ran the San Diego Marathon. She chased that effort with 23 more marathons.\n\nSo when Neville set off for her first transcontinental run from Ocean Beach, on May 1, 2010, heading toward Atlantic Beach, Florida, her main mission was to inspire others to \u201crethink the impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many people in every corner of every town who want to be a part of something,\u201d Neville said. \u201cImpossible to them obviously is not running around the perimeter, but it might be changing their diet or simply getting off the couch. I hope people see that the playing field wasn\u2019t level for me when I started, and I\u2019m still out here [running].\u201d\n\nAlong the way, she makes pit stops at hospitals, schools, cancer centers, and fire and police stations, telling her story while using her experience in the medical field to advocate for wellness.\n\n\u201cAs health professionals, we\u2019re in the position to improve the health of the nation,\u201d she said. \u201cTo do that, we need to improve the health of the citizens. People come to us for help, so I believe we should walk the walk of health, too.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also used the time alone on the asphalt to cope with her own difficulties. During her first trek, she grieved the loss of her mother. Her cancer returned the following year, forcing her to postpone her second expedition for two years. Then in February 2013, her brother passed away. She carried his ashes in an urn in her backpack for her 1,500-mile run a few months later.\n\nAnd while she hopes her journey will instill ambition in others, she said she has drawn inspiration from the individuals she\u2019s met along the way, too.\n\n\u201cI set out to deliver happiness and hope on foot,\u201d she said. \u201c[I\u2019ve learned that] we\u2019re different but nobody\u2019s better.

Following the first British triumph since 1936, the Scot said: \"I feel like you waste time because nothing ever gets done and I don't like wasting my time. I don't know where the next generation are.\"\n\nLloyd, who appeared in the 1978 Davis Cup final, claimed that Downey had not improved the state of British tennis. The Canadian was appointed in September 2013, a couple of months after Murray became the first British man to win Wimbledon for 77 years.\n\n\"I'm hearing that things aren't changing,\" Lloyd said. \"After Roger Draper left as chief executive, people were saying that he had made mistakes in various places, and that with the new guy here was the chance to change things.\n\n\"But this just seems to happen over and over again. What people tell me is that the LTA has gone backwards under Downey.\n\nGreat Britain's Davis Cup-winning team met David Cameron at 10 Downing Street on Tuesday. Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images for LTA\n\n\"I'm hearing this from people in the tennis industry, so this is from players and coaches. People in the business who love British tennis say that nothing is changing, and you can see Murray's frustrations with his comments.\n\n\"He's saying that he can't be bothered to listen to the same old stuff. Unfortunately, it is the same old stuff.\"\n\nLloyd welcomed Murray's intervention -- in which he claimed the UK's representation at the major junior events had declined -- but suggested his comments might have caused consternation at the LTA.\n\n\"When you're the top player, it's easy to think that you shouldn't be stirring up problems,\" Lloyd said. \"Everything you want is being taken care of, you're the man.\n\n\"Andy's comments are enough to send vibrations down the spine of the LTA. If the top player says he is unhappy, everybody in British tennis is going to listen.\n\n\"You can be sure that Murray's comments would have scared the life out of people at the LTA.\"\n\nMurray has said he has had just one conversation with Downey, lasting just 10 minutes, in the last two years, which Lloyd found \"mind-boggling\". \"It's same old, same old,\" he added.\n\nAndy Murray and Great Britain's Davis Cup team have demanded urgent change from the LTA. Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images for LTA\n\nLloyd also appeared to blame the All England Club for failing to articulate its feelings about the state of British tennis.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the club has provided the LTA with funds totalling something like \u00a3250 million from annual Wimbledon surpluses.\n\n\"For me, unfortunately, the whole tragedy of all this is Wimbledon,\" Lloyd said. \"Wimbledon always say that it's not their job to talk about British tennis and players, the job is to put on a great tournament.\n\n\"Wimbledon just keep on giving the LTA millions each year, with no input, and it's a tragedy.\n\n\"I look at Wimbledon and think why aren't they speaking out about the LTA when they have a chance to? If you're giving that amount of money each year, and you've got nothing to say about how it is spent, that's mind-boggling.\n\n\"If Wimbledon had a say in how the money was being spent, you have to think that things would be better.\n\n\"With the LTA, it's a failed business with a failed business plan that just keeps on failing. It's sad that Wimbledon pass the buck and say that it's not their job. My question to the top people at Wimbledon would be, 'Are you happy with the results?'\n\n\"You can't mask what's happening in British tennis by looking at the success Andy has had and the Davis Cup team has had. Because that's nothing to do with the LTA. You have to look at what is happening behind that. Take Andy out of the equation, and you can't say that British tennis is successful, because it isn't.\"", "Bradley Wiggins preparing to take on mythical Merckx Hour": "Editor's note: This article originally appeared at VeloNews.com.\n\nBradley Wiggins, who set a new world hour record this summer, has hinted he will take on the elusive \"Merckx Hour.\"\n\nIn a new book released this week, \"My Hour,\" Wiggins outlined a behind-the-scenes attack on the hour record of 54.526 km on June 7 at the Lee Valley VeloPark in London. In excerpts of the book posted on Sky's website, Wiggins hinted he may take on the Merckx Hour as well.\n\n\"Merckx's Hour was the definitive record. He's the benchmark,\" Wiggins wrote in the book. \"I've spoken about going for the record again, and I'm toying with going for his distance in an Athlete's Hour of my own.\n\n\"I'm planning on doing some tests with similar kit - a hairnet crash-hat and so on - to see what the numbers are. I might be way off his pace. I might not be able to hold his position and be as aerodynamic, but then Merckx wasn't aero in the slightest.\"\n\nWiggins' attempt this summer came in a wave of assaults on the hour record following UCI rule changes in 2014 that allowed bikes that met UCI standards for any endurance event on the track. Eight riders took up the challenge, and of those, five set new marks, with Wiggins' highly anticipated attempt setting what some consider a definitive new distance.\n\nThe so-called Merckx Hour (49.431 km, set in 1972) retains a mystical hold over the peloton because the Belgian legend was the last to set the hour record without the use of modern innovations such as disc wheels, aero helmets, carbon-fiber frames, and arm extenders.\n\nWiggins is a big admirer of Merckx, and said it would be the ultimate challenge to imitate the conditions of the Merckx Hour, and try to beat it.\n\n\"You watch him riding it and he's all over the place. You compare him with Chris [Boardman] doing his Athlete's Hour and Chris is so aerodynamic with that hunched back. In some ways, that just makes Merckx's even better,\" Wiggins wrote.\n\n\"He starts so fast. He did the first five kilometres in 5min 55sec, which would have got him a medal in a world pursuit championship at the time; he breaks the 5, 10 and 20km records which Ole Ritter set in a special ride which wasn't an Hour. And he just grunts it out for an hour with sheer brute force.\"\n\nWiggins did not put a date on a possible attempt, but suggested he would make some tests to see if it's realistic and feasible. Top on his priority list in 2016 will be a return to the track to try to win another gold medal in team pursuit at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games.\n\nWhen contacted by Sportwereld.be, Merckx said, \"[Wiggins] can do it.

Cam Newton, the season's top-scoring quarterback entering the week (328 fantasy points) and one found on 34 percent of ESPN finalists' rosters, scored a mere 13 fantasy points, while Tom Brady, second only to Newton entering the week (319) and found on 28 percent of ESPN finalists' rosters, scored 11. Neither finished among the top 15 at his position.\n\nNewton and Brady ranked 24th and 25th, respectively, among all NFL quarterbacks during the 16-game era -- that's 1978 forward -- to score at least 280 fantasy points through Week 15. But among those 25, their Week 16 scores each tied for sixth- and third-worst, respectively. Only Andrew Luck -- 322 fantasy points through Week 15, zero in Week 16, in 2014 -- and Randall Cunningham -- 314 through Week 15, six in Week 16 -- were definitively worse.\n\nHere is the full list of 25:\n\nPLAYER YEAR TEAM FPTS\n\nthru Wk15 Wk16\n\nFPTS Daunte Culpepper 2000 MIN 284 33 Peyton Manning 2013 DEN 348 32 Aaron Rodgers 2011 GB 353 32 Cam Newton 2011 CAR 311 30 Tom Brady 2011 NE 300 29 Daunte Culpepper 2004 MIN 312 25 Jeff Garcia 2000 SF 294 25 Steve Young 1994 SF 306 25 Dan Marino 1984 MIA 328 25 Drew Brees 2011 NO 323 24 Peyton Manning 2004 IND 329 21 Michael Vick 2010 PHI 280 20 Warren Moon 1990 HOU 295 19 Dan Marino 1986 MIA 294 18 Tom Brady 2007 NE 341 15 Aaron Rodgers 2014 GB 304 14 Tom Brady 2012 NE 296 14 Steve Young 1998 SF 310 14 Cam Newton 2015 CAR 328 13 Aaron Rodgers 2009 GB 295 13 Peyton Manning 2014 DEN 287 12 Tom Brady 2015 NE 319 11 Drew Brees 2013 NO 300 11 Randall Cunningham 1990 PHI 314 6 Andrew Luck 2014 IND 322 0\n\nWhat's worse, the only quarterback found on a greater number of ESPN finalists' rosters than Newton or Brady, Carson Palmer (35 percent), managed only 16 fantasy points to barely make the top 10.\n\nRunning like he's 22\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers' DeAngelo Williams scored 27 fantasy points, second-best among Week 16 running backs (entering Monday night's game). That gave him three games with at least 25 fantasy points this season, making the 32-year-old Williams the oldest NFL player since 1960 to accomplish that. He also now has four games worth at least 20, making him the second oldest to do that (John Riggins had six games worth 20-plus as a 34-year-old in 1983).\n\nFor the season, Williams has 180 fantasy points, third best among running backs. That's the seventh-best single-season total by any running back aged 32 or older -- with players' ages calculated on Nov. 1 -- since 1960 and it gives Williams a legitimate chance at a 200-point fantasy season, something only three other running backs aged 32 or older accomplished during that time span:\n\nPLAYER YEAR TEAM G FPTS AGE John Riggins 1983 WAS 15 272 34 Walter Payton 1986 CHI 16 220 32 John Riggins 1984 WAS 14 206 35 Ottis Anderson 1989 NYG 16 199 32 Ricky Williams 2009 MIA 16 197 32 Mike Anderson 2005 DEN 15 185 32 DeAngelo Williams 2015 PIT 15 180 32 John Henry Johnson 1962 PIT 14 180 32 Fred Jackson 2013 BUF 16 174 32 Jerome Bettis 2004 PIT 15 172 32 Marcus Allen 1993 KC 16 170 33\n\nMiscellany\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston scored 18 points on Sunday, giving him seven games out of 15 with at least that many, and increasing his season total to 245.

They're not always pretty, but Bortles has been consistently productive at the most critical time of the fantasy season, scoring at least 20 points in every game he played between Weeks 12-16. Since 1960, he is only the fifth player to do that, joining Randall Cunningham (1998), Larry Johnson (2005), Michael Vick (2010) and Drew Brees (2011).\n\nBortles now has 299 fantasy points for the season, the eighth most by any quarterback in one of his first two years in the NFL, behind only Dan Marino (353, 1984, second season), Cam Newton (352, 2011, first), Jeff Garcia (327, 2000, second), Daunte Culpepper (324, 2000, second), Kurt Warner (311, 1999, second), Newton (309, 2012, second) and Robert Griffin III (303, 2012, first). Bortles also has one game remaining: A road game against the Houston Texans.\n\nIn a game he played at the age of 29 years, 218 days -- and what was only his seventh game of the season following a three-year absence from the NFL -- New Orleans Saints running back Tim Hightower scored a career-best 28 fantasy points on Sunday to lead his position. Two of Hightower's five-best single-game efforts have now occurred during the past three weeks: He scored 15 in Week 14, which is tied for his fifth-best effort.\n\nArizona Cardinals running back David Johnson scored 17 fantasy points on Sunday, his fourth consecutive double-digit performance, all of which came in his first four NFL starts. Johnson has scored 86 fantasy points in his first four NFL starts, which trails only Devonta Freeman (121), Larry Johnson (103), Corey Dillon (88) and Arian Foster (88) among running backs since 1991 (the earliest season for which detailed \"starts\" data is available).\n\nAtlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones scored 23 fantasy points against the Panthers, tied for the most at his position (entering Monday). That is the most that any wide receiver has scored against cornerback Josh Norman's team since Jordan Matthews had 25 in Week 10 last season, and it was Jones' most against the Panthers since Week 14 of the 2012 season, Norman's first in the league.\n\nNew York Jets wide receiver Brandon Marshall matched Jones' 23 fantasy points for the position lead in Week 16, and that score gave Marshall his second season with at least 200, as he now has 205. Marshall's previous three best campaigns in terms of fantasy points all came in seasons during which Jay Cutler was his quarterback: He had 210 in 2012 and 198 in 2013 while both players were with the Chicago Bears, and 170 in 2007 while both were with the Denver Broncos.", "Tour de France winner Chris Froome makes good on promises by releasing test results": "PARIS -- Making good on a pledge he made when he won the Tour de France, Chris Froome released the results of laboratory tests on his body to counter skeptics in France who have repeatedly expressed doubts that he rides clean.\n\nA lab in London measured how efficiently Froome's body uses oxygen, and tested his power and endurance. The results were published late Thursday on the website of Esquire magazine.\n\nOne test of VO2 max, an indication of how effectively the body transports oxygen from the air to muscles during intense exercise, measured Froome at 84.6, more than double the number seen in the general population.\n\n\"Off the charts. We've never had anything close to that in the lab,\" Esquire quoted one of the lab's sports scientists, Phillip Bell, as saying. \"Froome's values are close to what we believe are the upper limits for VO2 peak in humans.\"\n\nThe lab also found that Froome can produce up to 525 watts of power when he pedals, and can sustain a very high power output -- 419 watts -- for 20-40 minutes. Such numbers could help explain why Froome not only looks comfortable on the Tour's steep and long mountain climbs, but can also squeeze out bursts of speed when necessary.\n\n\"I'm the only one who can really say 100 percent that I'm clean,\" the magazine quoted Froome as saying. \"I haven't broken the rules. I haven't cheated. I haven't taken any secret substance that isn't known of yet. I know my results will stand the test of time, that 10, 15 years down the line people won't say, 'Ah, so that was his secret.' There isn't a secret.\"\n\nWith skepticism abundant in cycling after Lance Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour wins for systematic doping, the tests on Froome are unlikely to convince die-hard doubters. But in submitting himself for tests and releasing such personal data, the Sky rider is going the extra mile to be more transparent than many other top athletes, who generally don't publish such information if they have it.\n\nFroome, who won the 2013 and 2015 Tours, has never failed a doping test, but he got a rough ride from some race commentators and a tiny minority of roadside spectators on his way to victory in July. He said one man even splashed him with urine as he rode past.\n\n\"It's hard not to get angry.

(3:02)\n\nDENVER -- Peyton Manning's stall was stripped bare in the far corner of the Denver Broncos' locker room, a place of considerable Monday night merriment, when tight end Owen Daniels stood nearby and considered the one conspicuous hole in an otherwise special event. The Broncos had locked down a playoff berth in their overtime victory over the Cincinnati Bengals, and yet something else was virtually clinched in the process:\n\nThe fact that Peyton Manning won't be the quarterback determining whether Denver advances to the Super Bowl.\n\nBrock Osweiler is a young man the Broncos believe in, according to Daniels.\n\n\"I know we'll do well with whoever we've got,\" Daniels said. \"We've got a GOAT [greatest of all time] and a guy who's up and coming and doing a great job for us. We'll ride with whatever the deal is.\"\n\nEditor's Picks Legwold: Osweiler helps Broncos bounce back, clinch playoff berth Quarterback Brock Osweiler had to lead two winning drives. But in the end, he helped the Broncos clinch a playoff bid.\n\nThe deal looks pretty simple now. Barring another Osweiler injury to go with his bum shoulder, Broncos coach Gary Kubiak almost certainly won't pull him in favor of a returning Manning on Sunday -- or at some point in the postseason. Meaning the last public act of Manning's NFL career could be the all-out blitz he called on the Al-Jazeera report that linked him to human growth hormone.\n\n\"I just think it's kind of a shame, the other stuff that's going on with him,\" Daniels said. \"The guy's done it right his whole career. We know he's toward the end of his career now, and you hate to see people try to do stuff to legends like that. I believe in Peyton, 100 percent. I feel for him that he's got to go through this, but if anyone can handle it, Peyton can.\"\n\nManning has no choice but to handle it now. He was all bundled up on the sideline for part of an ice-cold Monday night, and he had to be wondering how his endgame turned so ugly and cruel. If he's telling the truth about the Al-Jazeera report that he started shredding the other day to ESPN's Lisa Salters, then he deserves so much better than what he's getting now.\n\nHis body has failed him. His team has moved on without him. His replacement has shown enough strength, poise and youthful vitality to stay in there. And all anyone wants to discuss with one of the NFL's signature players and ambassadors -- in his final football hours -- is whether he once took a walk on the wild side to get back on the field. If this is Manning's final season, wow, it has been some retirement tour. The Broncos might still earn the No. 1 seed in the AFC, might still win the whole damn thing, and Manning might have to watch it all like he watched on Monday night.\n\nIn some ways, his contemporary, Kobe Bryant, has it much easier. Bryant is finishing out with a dreadful Lakers team and yet every road trip is defined by a well-earned celebration of his career. On Monday night in Charlotte, Bryant listened as a tribute from Michael Jordan played on the video board. Manning didn't receive any such pregame tribute from John Elway at Sports Authority Field.\n\nAnd for a while there against the Bengals, Osweiler opened the door a bit for Manning. He was riding a two-game losing streak and developing a nasty habit of disappearing in the second half even before the Bengals took an early 14-0 lead. Osweiler made some bad decisions and took some unnecessary sacks, and soon enough, some of the locals were heard booing him.\n\nHe recovered on a breathless touchdown drive to start the third quarter and didn't flinch when Brandon McManus shanked what would have been a winning field goal at the close of regulation. Osweiler completed a couple of huge third-down passes on the winning overtime drive, then stood by as AJ McCarron fumbled the Broncos into the tournament.\n\nThough he said some awfully nice things about Osweiler, Kubiak wouldn't commit to him as his starter for the rest of the season. He didn't need to make it official, nor did Osweiler.\n\n\"This isn't about Peyton,\" the quarterback said. \"This isn't about myself. Tonight is about this football team.\n\n\"I'm going to show up whether I'm the starter, whether I'm the backup. I'm going to prepare the same exact way. I'm going to be the same exact guy in that building, regardless of the situation.\"\n\nFrankly, it would have been more fun to see Manning retake control of this team for the stretch run. He would've been a different player, a different person; the Al-Jazeera documentary would've guaranteed it. Manning would've returned an angry man.\n\nIf Manning was always clinical in his approach, Tom Brady was always the angry one -- the quarterback who struggled so long and hard just to get the starting job at Michigan before he was taken 199th in the 2000 draft. Brady has played with a controlled fury in defiance of those doubting scouts, smoldering behind that cover-boy face; he was inspired by real and imagined slights even before Deflategate took his emotions to an entirely different place.\n\nManning? What has he had to be mad about, other than the fact he didn't win the Heisman at Tennessee? Nobody doubted his greatness all the way back to high school. He was the No. 1 overall pick in his draft, an immediate starter and franchise player-to-be in Indianapolis and, soon enough, a commercial endorsement juggernaut just as familiar to American consumers as Flo from the Progressive ads and the Aflac duck.\n\nYeah, he was fired by the Colts after missing a season and enduring four neck surgeries, and yeah, people would remind Manning of his 5-11 record against Brady and his nine one-and-dones in the playoffs. But he was a five-time MVP who did win the Super Bowl ring that Dan Marino and other Hall of Famers couldn't win. And he was leading a hell of a sporting life until this year. Until the Broncos started phasing him out. Until his 39-year-old body started falling apart. Until Osweiler replaced him.\n\nUntil Al-Jazeera reported that an anti-aging clinic in Indianapolis shipped human growth hormone to his wife, Ashley, allegedly for Peyton Manning's use.\n\nThe veins in his famous forehead ready to explode, Manning did everything but shoot lasers through your TV screen while trashing the report in his interview with Salters. He denied ever using HGH or any performance-enhancing drugs, and he attacked Al-Jazeera for violating his wife's right to medical privacy. Of course, Manning did not specifically deny that a package from the clinic in question was sent to his wife.\n\nBut in giving Manning the benefit of the doubt, it's clear his rage is rooted in the depths of his stunning recovery. In the early hours of his rehab, Manning's parents weren't sure he would ever appear in another game.\n\n\"We didn't know how he could play at that position,\" Archie Manning told ESPN.com in 2013. \"I remember when he first started throwing, I mean, it was a 10-yard lob and you just don't know. And you wonder, 'Gosh, can he get back where he can throw in an NFL football game.'\"\n\nPeyton would come back to throw for 131 touchdowns and nearly 15,000 yards in his first three seasons in Denver. His career appeared to be headed toward a satisfactory close, with or without the second ring, before Elway fired the head coach (John Fox) and offensive coordinator (Adam Gase) who helped Manning play at a record-breaking pace.\n\nElway demanded that Manning take a $4 million pay cut, and suddenly the quarterback who used to run Broncos practices like a symphony conductor was being asked by the new coach, Kubiak, to take some practices off. Once the regular season got underway, Manning looked older than his birth certificate as he tried to fight through a foot injury he wanted kept quiet. He threw too many weak and wobbly passes, absorbed too many hits and struggled to adjust to a Kubiak offense better suited for Osweiler.\n\nManning hadn't played since Nov. 15 and yet was still leading the league in interceptions (17) when Al-Jazeera released its report. He couldn't get out the door unscathed. He couldn't retire before he was accused of PED use and before his vehement denials were measured against those once delivered by the cheating likes of Alex Rodriguez and Lance Armstrong. Archie Manning didn't want to break down the Al-Jazeera film on Monday, but when asked whether he thought his son's anger could make him a better football player if and when he returns, Archie texted this response: \"Hopefully. Probably easier if playing LB.\"\n\nManning won't be playing linebacker on Sunday against the San Diego Chargers, and he might not play quarterback for the Broncos ever again. Is there a chance Osweiler gets hurt or stumbles or forces Kubiak to recall that Manning did beat Brady in their past two conference championship meetings? Yeah, there's a chance. A small one.\n\nIt's more likely Manning will spend more time answering questions from league investigators in the coming weeks than he'll spend behind center. And if he's telling the truth about HGH, this all-time great deserved a much better goodbye than that.", "Lee Westwood will be ranked No. 50, earn spot in 2016 Masters field": "With the final ranking of the year left to make it official, 15 players are set to join the 2016 Masters field via the Official World Golf Ranking, including Englishman Lee Westwood, who by a fraction will hold down the 50th spot on the list.\n\nWestwood, who tied for second two weeks ago in the Thailand Golf Championship, dropped to 51st this week, but OWGR officials said he will move back to 50th in the final ranking.

The title bout headlined UFC on Fox inside Amway Center.\n\nThe loss was the first for Cerrone (28-7) since August 2013, when he dropped a decision to dos Anjos. Riding an eight-fight winning streak, Cerrone promised a rematch would be different, but dos Anjos was up to the challenge.\n\nImmediately following the win, dos Anjos sent an invitation to current featherweight champion Conor McGregor to move up to lightweight.

Al Powers for ESPN\n\nIt's hard to argue with that. Fighting out of Kings MMA in Southern California, dos Anjos moved to 10-1 in his past 11 fights. His last loss came by decision to Khabib Nurmagomedov, inside Amway Center in April 2014. Since that defeat, dos Anjos has been outstanding, recording five wins in a row.\n\nCerrone, 32, never even got started in a title fight he was forced to wait months for because of dos Anjos' lingering knee injury. According to Fightmetric, Cerrone landed just four strikes in the fight. After eating a stiff lead left in the first exchange, Cerrone seemed slightly tentative, and he ate a hard kick to the body moments later.\n\nCerrone attempted to hide the effects of the kick, but it was obvious he was badly hurt. He retreated to the fence, where dos Anjos unloaded a string of punches that snapped his head back. Dazed, Cerrone managed to circle off the cage and basically run backward, but dos Anjos was on him the whole way. In a final act of desperation, Cerrone ducked for a takedown, but dos Anjos sprawled and continued to land shots to the head.\n\n\"Listen, McGregor. If you want to come to the lightweight division, this is my division.\" Rafael dos Anjos\n\nIt was a vindicating win for dos Anjos, who dealt with performance-enhancing drug accusations from Cerrone during the build-up to the fight. Dos Anjos has never failed a drug test, but Cerrone publicly questioned the changes in his physique in recent years.\n\n\"I'm so happy, man,\" dos Anjos said. \"I just proved that I've come to this division to stay. All those accusations people were throwing at me, I'm here with my belt. It's just the beginning of my career now.\n\n\"Cerrone is a great opponent. The guy won eight fights straight.

Running is a part of the fabric of the city, and there are plenty of reasons New Yorkers and others push themselves to cover 26.2 miles through all five boroughs.\n\nHere, five New Yorkers tell the stories of how they came to love running, how its healing power helped them overcome obstacles and heartache, and what motivates them to keep going.\n\nSam, former smoker\n\nSeth Ricart\n\n\"I've been on my own since I was 16. My parents were in a religious cult. We were always on the move. My dad has lived in 27 different homes since I've been alive. \"\n\n\"I started smoking when I was 21. Alcohol and cigarettes were crutches that allowed me to open up socially. [They] were a big part of the crowd I hung with and the people I wanted to be accepted by.\"\n\n\"I moved to New York in 2006. I wanted to live in the most challenging place I could find. The first six or seven times I attempted to quit I tried the patch, nicotine gum, even hypnotism -- which worked for a month.\"\n\n\"I realized I needed something healthy, something more in my essence. That's when I started running seriously.\"\n\n\"The thought of running a marathon used to be absolutely ludicrous to me. I'm not married. I've never had a kid. I didn't graduate from high school. But a lot changes when you give up a habit like cigarettes. You feel like you can do anything.\"\n\nFelipe, Mexican immigrant\n\nSeth Ricart\n\n\"I was born and raised in a small state in Mexico and herded cattle with my father. I think a lot of my strength and endurance comes from growing up in the mountains.\"\n\n\"I crossed the U.S.-Mexico border twice. The first time was easy. The second time ... I was robbed and held for a month. It took two more attempts before I was able to successfully cross.\n\n\"I never felt the need to stop. My desire to continue was always because of my children. Family is most important to me. I knew how much I needed to provide for them. It's how I express my love.\"\n\nSeth Ricart\n\n\"I've lived in New York City for 15 years. I came here for economic reasons. I have two girls and two boys back home. I speak to my children every day. The affection has never gone away. \"\n\n\"I was excited to run when I first came to New York. Running is different here. You can run at night and see the city lights. You can't do that in Mexico. Running is my addiction. I run about 100 miles a week. I can feel bad, sad or tired from work; running is a way of balancing me.\"\n\n\"I always have people around me, but running makes me feel better that I'm not with my family. I can sit and think about how much I miss my family, but instead I choose to run. I've been running for 25 years. My goal is to continue to run until I die.\"\n\nBlue, grieving son\n\nSeth Ricart\n\n\"I'm African-American and Cherokee Indian. My mom's an architect; my dad was an orthodontist. He came from nothing and bettered his life through sports. My dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000. He passed away on July 7, 2007.\"\n\n\"Everything fell apart after he died. He was a big part of my life, and I felt like I had no one. I lost it. I had the deepest plunge into depression for a year. I felt like giving up. While I dealt with my dad's estate, my girlfriend and I broke up.\"\n\nSeth Ricart\n\n\"I felt an aggressive anger about the loss of my dad and the breakup. It was maddening. I wanted to hit something. I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. I went to a therapist for several months. But the real therapy came when I started to run.\"\n\n\"I ran as fast as I could and exhausted myself completely. The pain I felt inside made me run faster, and sometimes I'd cry. I felt like a man on fire, like I was running through a burning building and needed to get out. And when I was done with a run, I relaxed.\"\n\n\"Running really shook me up, like getting slapped in the face. It opened me up to different people, things and relationships. I never expected that to happen. \"\n\nAmira, mother of two\n\nSeth Ricart\n\n\"I got pregnant in 2005. I was 26 at the time, living in New York. I felt ready to have a baby. One day I was lying down during yoga, and I didn't feel the baby moving. I went to my OB-GYN. My doctor didn't see a heartbeat. I felt emptiness, like I was going to die.\"\n\n\"I felt angry, sad and shocked. You feel like it's a personal thing when your body fails you. I felt like I let down my husband and my family.\"\n\n\"I got pregnant four months later. I delivered my son at 35 weeks. I was a very anxious parent then, and also after my second son was born. After things started to settle down, I realized I needed something for myself. I started to run again.\"\n\n\"The best hour of my day was when I ran, often in Central Park. Running helped me feel strong, like my body wasn't letting me down and that I could achieve things. I feel at peace now, 10 years later. Running helped me find that peace. I'll always run. And hopefully my kids will come with me once in a while.\"\n\nRobin, running coach/cycling instructor/ultramarathoner\n\nSeth Ricart\n\n\"I was 20 years old and in my senior year at NYU. One Friday night, I was in a restaurant when a man walked in and said he'd been shot. In an instant, the perpetrator grabbed my hair and dragged me.\"\n\n\"I thought it was a robbery and that he'd take our money and go. But he threw down garbage bags and made me tie people. Then he sprayed kerosene and flicked a lighter. Then he held a gun to one side of my temple and a lighter to the other. He used me as a shield against the NYPD stationed outside.\"\n\n\"A woman jumped him from behind. The police shot him -- the bullet grazed his temple -- and rushed in.\"\n\n\"It wasn't until I started running that I began to process everything and carve out this white noise. I'm nostalgic for that time, because running was never as simple or powerful for me as it was then. I had so much stress and tension to run out.\"\n\n\"Now, after all this time, I have peace. I'm a running coach, cycling instructor and ultramarathoner. I've run 17 marathons to date. One time, I ran five marathons in five days across Utah. I'm fueled by the ethos that there is no finish line.\"\n\n\"What's the deeper reason that actually keeps me running? It's that cathartic feeling of growth.

Today we look at the top coaches of the year, but click here to check out the rest of our list.\n\nTop coaches of the year\n\n1. Boris Becker\n\nJulian Finney/Getty Images\n\nBecker's appointment as Novak Djokovic's coach ahead of the 2014 season was not met with universal approach, with some unsure whether the Serb made a wise choice. At the start of 2015, some of those critics were still chirping away. Only now, after Djokovic's astonishing season, have those detractors fallen silent.\n\nWhat could they possibly say after a year in which Djokovic won 11 titles, including three Grand Slams, and become the first man in history to earn more than $20 million in prize money in a season? Becker won six majors as a player and now has four as a coach. Could 2016 see Becker the coach surpass Becker the player?\n\n2. Patrick Mouratoglou\n\nJean Catuffe/GC Images\n\nClearly there are limits to the Frenchman's influence, as he couldn't prevent Serena Williams from experiencing intolerable levels of stress in New York as she attempted -- and failed -- to become the first woman since 1988 to accomplish the calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\nMouratoglou said he takes responsibility for Williams' not being better prepared to cope with the tension of playing Italy's Roberta Vinci in a semifinal of the US Open, but it's unlikely any coach could have done more. And as disappointing as that defeat was, let it not be forgotten how Mouratoglou enabled Williams to gather titles at the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon.\n\n3. Severin Luthi\n\nMatthew Stockman/Getty Images\n\nFor all the fine work Stefan Edberg has done with Roger Federer, the Swede wasn't the one who helped create and hone the \"Sneak Attack by Roger.\" It was Luthi, toiling in Edberg's shadow, who encouraged Federer to push on through the jet lag and to extend his pre-tournament practice session at the Cincinnati Masters.\n\nThat was when Federer started fooling around by half-volleying his service returns and then roaring into net to look for a volley. When the laughter all around the court subsided, Luthi encouraged him to take the shot seriously. This was a new shot, but it was also much more than that; it was a demonstration of Federer's desire to innovate and to challenge the Djok-ocracy.\n\n4. Leon Smith\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nThere has never been a faster rise in Davis Cup, and very few triumphs have been more unexpected than Smith's team winning the title. It was just five years ago that Great Britain was facing the possibility of dropping to the lowest level of the competition, alongside nations such as San Marino and Andorra.\n\nBut Great Britain beat Turkey to get back into the World Group, which was Smith's first as captain, and then this year defeated the three other Grand Slam nations -- the United States, France and Australia -- before repelling Belgium in the final. Judy Murray calls Smith \"my third son.\" Others soon could find themselves addressing him as \"Sir Leon.\"\n\n5. Rob Steckley\n\nTA TV\n\nSometimes it takes little more than a phone with video capabilities to remind you that tennis is supposed to be fun. In addition to guiding Lucie Safarova to her Grand Slam final -- she was the runner-up to Williams at Roland Garros -- Steckley also produced riotous videos. One of those was a film starring Safarova's doubles partner, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, which teased the All England Club for its strict clothing rules.\n\nCentral to Steckley's coaching philosophy is that you \"shouldn't forget how to smile.\" That approach clearly seems to be working with Safarova. She also won two Grand Slam doubles titles with Mattek-Sands and qualified for both the singles and doubles fields for the year-end championships.\n\n6.

As Williams said earlier this year at the French Open: \"Andy really is pro-women.\"\n\nAnd as Murray himself wrote in the French newspaper L'Equipe: \"Have I become a feminist? Well, if being a feminist is about fighting so that a woman is treated like a man, then, yes, I suppose I have. My upbringing means that I'm quite attuned to the whole thing. I came to tennis thanks to my mother. I think it's a crying shame that there aren't more female coaches.\"\n\nAfter having her first child, Aaron, in the summer, Mauresmo will return from maternity leave to resume her coaching duties.", "The blue-collar blue-chip life of Clemson Tigers quarterback Deshaun Watson": "ESPN's Todd McShay and Joey Galloway break down whether Oklahoma QB Baker Mayfield or Clemson QB Deshaun Watson will have a bigger impact on his team's success in the Capital One Orange Bowl. (1:30)\n\nDeshaun Watson is a busy man these days. Chad Morris understands that, so he tries to be respectful of the demands on his old quarterback's time. Still, he likes to check in -- a text here and there, at least a few times a week, maybe every day.\n\nThey'll talk on the phone, too. Watson wants to stay in touch, check in on his former coach. They don't talk much football, but the phone gets passed around to Morris' wife and son. Watson wants to get the scoop on their lives, too.\n\nThe Tigers' superstar quarterback and the man who brought him to Clemson are now separated by nearly 1,000 miles and on divergent career paths, but there's a bond there that neither will allow to be broken.\n\nWatson calls Morris, now the head coach at SMU, one of his best friends.\n\nMorris knows Watson might be the best player he'll ever coach, the gem he discovered before the rest of the world.\n\nAnd now that Watson's career has reached the verge of a championship, Morris remains along for the ride.\n\n\"We talk all the time,\" Watson said. \"It's about how we're doing, and how we hope we'll see each other soon.\"\n\nWatson was an elite recruit who has acted like a walk-on, his coaches and teammates say. Tyler Smith/Getty Images\n\nIt was a warm summer afternoon at Clemson five years ago when former Tigers cornerback Robert Smith was strolling past the practice field during a camp for prospects.\n\nSmith had never heard of Watson, had no clue who the kid was, but the skinny QB with the perfect mechanics and the big arm was impossible to ignore. Watson moved faster than everyone else, looked sharper.\n\n\"I was like, 'This kid is just on a different level,'\" Smith recalled. \"I knew there was no way he was leaving without an offer.\"\n\nIt wasn't hard to see that Watson was special from an early age, and as his legend grew at Gainesville (Ga.) High, where he'd win a state title and rewrite the record books, every coach and scout and recruiting site in America eventually saw what Smith did that day.\n\nBut no one saw it at the college recruiting level before Morris.\n\n\"I was at Clemson maybe a week, maybe three or four days, when I offered him,\" said Morris, the former Tigers offensive coordinator, who came aboard in 2011. \"I saw Vince Young in high school, and this kid from Gainesville, Georgia, was just as special.\"\n\nThis was Clemson's advantage. The Tigers were first, and as it turned out, that meant a lot to Watson.\n\nMorris was in the gym for Watson's basketball games as a high school sophomore. He introduced Watson to his wife and kids. He spent nearly four full years laying the groundwork, and Watson rewarded him with unwavering loyalty. Watson never took an official visit anywhere but Clemson.\n\nEditor's Picks How No. 1 Clemson was built in recruiting Through a tactful footprint in Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas, Clemson built its program.\n\nWith Sooners focused on his legs, Deshaun Watson touts his strong arm As the numbers show, Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson can win by any means necessary.\n\nPFF: 21 predictions for final 21 games of bowl season Want to look smart at your New Year's party? Then pretend these Pro Football Focus predictions are your own, and let everybody know how the last 21 games of the season will play out. 2 Related\n\n\"I devoted pretty much my entire time at Clemson to recruiting him,\" Morris said. \"Any time there was an opportunity for us to visit him or his school, any time the NCAA allowed it, I was there. But I knew that he was going to be special from the day I saw him.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Clemson to see the results of the work that Morris and Watson put in. On the first drive of Watson's college career, he whipped a bullet to Charone Peake in the end zone at Georgia's Sanford Stadium, wowing even the raucous Bulldogs fans. Two weeks later, he'd wrestled the starting job away from senior Cole Stoudt with an impressive performance in relief at Florida State, and in his first career start at North Carolina, Watson threw six touchdown passes.\n\n\"We set the record for most times using the word 'wow' on the headsets,\" receivers coach Jeff Scott said of Watson's freshman campaign.\n\nFor all the wows, there were setbacks, too. Watson was hurt twice during the season, beating South Carolina with a torn ACL. The success was instant, but Watson hadn't come close to reaching his potential.\n\nThen Morris got the call offering him a job as the head coach at Southern Methodist. Four years of relationship building with Watson was about to come undone.\n\nMorris laughs now about his decision, but at the time it was gut-wrenching.\n\n\"I knew what was coming,\" Morris said. \"If Deshaun could stay healthy, I knew what they could achieve.\"\n\nIf Morris was worried about walking away just before his investment paid off, Clemson fans wondered if Watson would struggle without the man who'd sold him on the Tigers to begin with.\n\nPart of the allure of Clemson was Morris' offense. It was a nearly exact replica of what Watson ran in high school, perfectly suited to Watson's strengths as a QB. Watson was talented enough to succeed in any offense, but major changes could reset his development.\n\nSo Morris picked up the phone and called Watson. He wanted his quarterback's blessing before his decision was final. Watson was happy to give it.\n\n\"It was hard, but at this level I understand what this role and what this business is, and he had to take the next step,\" Watson said. \"I knew during my recruiting process that some day he would be a head coach. It was just time to move on and take that next step.\"\n\nWith Watson steering the ship, Clemson heads into the CFP as the nation's No. 1 team. AP Photo/Bob Leverone\n\nWatson's offseason rehab on his injured knee kept him out of spring practice as Scott and Tony Elliott, now co-offensive coordinators, installed their version of Morris' offense. In Clemson's opening game, Mike Williams -- one of Watson's favorite targets in 2014 -- went down with a neck injury. By Week 2, every starter from last year's offensive line was gone from the lineup.\n\nWatson never flinched.\n\nIn his first season without Morris, Watson led Clemson to a 13-0 record, excelled as a runner and passer en route to a third-place finish in the Heisman balloting, and has the Tigers two games from a national championship. It's everything Morris predicted when he first saw Watson five years ago. He's just doing it for a new set of playcallers.\n\n\"He's just relentless about preparing,\" Tigers head coach Dabo Swinney said. \"Thats what I love about him. He doesn't let anything get in the way of that.\"\n\nAcross the field in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Capital One Orange Bowl, Oklahoma's Baker Mayfield has made headlines with his rags-to-riches story and the massive chip on his shoulder. Watson's journey to this point was the opposite. Everyone loved him, but he found the one coach he could trust.\n\nThat's a special story, too, Morris insists. It's a rare thing to find a kid that talented who stays true to his word, stays loyal through adversity, lives up to the hype in every way possible.\n\nScott put it more succinctly: \"He's one of those guys that, as coaches, you may never coach someone else like that.\"\n\nWatson shrugs it all off. It's a funny thing to have every dream become reality, every optimistic prediction proven accurate. Some folks might be surprised by that. Not Watson. Not Morris.\n\n\"I knew he'd have the success he's having right now. I knew they'd be really good,\" Morris said. \"And I'm excited for him, excited for all of them.\"", "MLB rumors roundup: More moves in Cincinnati?": "There has been little downtime for the Cincinnati Reds' front office this holiday season.\n\nCloser Aroldis Chapman was dealt to the New York Yankees on Monday, a deal that picked up steam after the two teams reportedly held some very productive discussions on Christmas Eve. Once Chapman was officially sent to the Bronx, Reds president of baseball operations Walt Jocketty confirmed that the franchise overhaul remains a work in progress.\n\nC. Trent Rosecrans of the Cincinnati Enquirer reports Jocketty, who already has traded away Johnny Cueto, Mike Leake and Todd Frazier in 2015, is still looking to deal outfielder Jay Bruce and has not given up on the idea of moving second baseman Brandon Phillips.\n\nThe Reds would love to find a taker for Bruce, who will make a reasonable $12.5 million next season with a club option for 2017. Bruce has averaged 26 homers per year over his first eight seasons, but has just a .222 batting average and .288 OBP over the past two years.\n\nJim Duquette of MLB.com recently suggested Kansas City as a possible landing spot for Bruce if the Royals are unable to re-sign Alex Gordon. Bruce would provide additional power to an outfield that currently has Jarrod Dyson and Paulo Orlando penciled in at the corner spots.\n\nPhillips invoked his no-trade clause to prevent a trade that would have sent him to Washington a few weeks ago, and the Nationals filled their second base vacancy by agreeing to a deal with free agent Daniel Murphy. Said Jocketty of Phillips on Monday: \"It's not set that [he's with the Reds], but likely he might be, yeah.\" Perhaps Phillips will be more open to a deal in spring training when the reality of a very long season in Cincinnati stares him in the face.\n\nOur rumors roundup continues with more fallout from the Chapman deal:", "John Buccigross talks to Patrick O'Sullivan about harrowing childhood": "Back in January 2014, I wrote:\n\nParenting is easy if you have an abundance of four things: 1. Energy 2. Creativity 3. Selflessness 4. Affection\n\nIf you give your kids everything you have inside of you, they will eventually give it back. They won't want to let you down. You won't have to punish them or push them to exert.\n\nFewer words and more action is the recipe.\n\nTo review and expand:\n\nI should have written \"easier\" and/or \"more effective\" in that opening sentence. Parenting is not easy, and for some it doesn't come natural. Parenting always came natural and easy to me.\n\nEnergy to play catch or go skating whenever they ask. Energy to build a backyard rink and drive hours to an NHL game. The best role model you can be for your kids is to be upbeat and energetic. That's where all true success begins. I bet most great athletes -- Jack Nicklaus, Tom Brady, Bobby Orr, Wayne Gretzky, Michael Jordan, Serena Williams -- had a parent or parents that had a palpable energy about them. It could be a fun, serious, congenial or unique energy, but something there a child could feed off.\n\nCreativity is using your brain to stimulate and help guide your child's brain to a fertile place by exposing them to different environments and emphasizing curiosity, interest and wonder. Trying to get them to repeat good habits by changing the environment and keeping their interest and enthusiasm high.\n\nSelflessness is, as they say, not thinking less of yourself but thinking of yourself less. And the understanding that when it comes to parenting you can actually mess your kid up more than you can help him or her. Introduce them to many things and then take a step back.\n\nAffection is to be there. Being there in person and in mind. It's hugging, kissing, \"I love you's,\" traditions, laughter, singing and silliness. My dad never hit me and I have never hit my kids. It's difficult to fly, dream and believe when you're being beaten down.\n\nO'Sullivan played 188 games over parts of three season for the Kings. Victor Decolongon/Getty Images\n\nFormer NHL player Patrick O'Sullivan's parents had very little of what I call the Big Four of Parenting. In fact, it went way beyond ignorance. They physically and emotionally pummeled their little boy. The word abuse has become too soft of a word. Patrick O'Sullivan was pummeled by his parents. Somehow, he persevered to play in 334 NHL games.\n\nO'Sullivan's first-person account of his childhood was read by many for the first time last week after it was released by The Players' Tribune. It wasn't \"breaking news.\" O'Sullivan's story surfaced in a 2003 Minneapolis Star-Tribune article after he was drafted by the Minnesota Wild. The book \"Breaking Away: A Harrowing True Story of Resilience, Courage, and Triumph\" was released in October, and we ran an excerpt from that book in November.\n\nHowever, The Players' Tribune article struck a chord with many as it was tweeted and retweeted on Twitter by a large roster of sports fans. Like other adults not related to O'Sullivan when he was a little boy and through adolescence, the mass sports population somewhat ignored his story until his first-person, no-holds-barred account broke trough. Readers were left with broken hearts reading of the boy with the broken heart. And bloody face.\n\nCasual and non-hockey fans were reading the revealing and disturbing story for the first time, and it struck an emotional chord. And the prevailing questions were undoubtedly, \"How could a father do this to his precious son?\" and \"How could a mother sit idly by and let it happen?\"\n\nBecause the story was read by so many for the first time and the reaction was so moving, I thought I would call O'Sullivan for a follow-up conversation.\n\nLiving in Naples, Florida, with his wife, Sophie, and two sons, O'Sullivan is a self-aware, no-filter, clear-spoken, 30-year-old man. His mind is nimble and smart. He probably would be an excellent TV analyst. He can navigate sentences and paragraphs to make his point vividly and clearly. In my opinion, he was born mentally tough. It's a skill. His parents contributed ZERO to his mental toughness. He would be mentally tough if he was raised by monks.\n\nO'Sullivan was the OHL and CHL rookie of the year in 2002 playing for the Mississauga Ice Dogs. Bruce Bennett/Getty Images\n\nHere is our conversation:\n\nBuccigross: What's it feel like to hit your dad?\n\nO'Sullivan: That's a good question. For me it felt good. He was the person I hated the most in my life. It was something I had to do to take control of my life. I had started to kind of fight back, but not like this. This was it. It was my only option. I had no regrets immediately, after or since. This happened at his parents' house. He left in the car, I went inside, called the police; he eventually went to jail for three months, and I haven't interacted with him since the fight. I saw him at court when I got the restraining order extended and sometimes he would show up at my games, but I haven't talked to him since the fight.\n\nBuccigross: Did you get rattled when you saw him in the crowd at one of your games?\n\nO'Sullivan: Yes. It bothered me because he didn't deserve to see me play. He made sure I could see him. It possibly bothered me the first few times. I couldn't believe he was breaking the law. I would take five or 10 minutes to get my focus back. The restraining order eventually expired, but I never feared for my safety. I didn't even think twice about him getting close enough. He wasn't a dumb person. Everything was calculated. He got away with the abuse for a decade, but now he couldn't get away with it. My dad felt like he should have been an NHL player and for one reason or another got screwed during his journey. So he was going to show everybody how smart he was by how good I was. That was his sole motivation. I don't think my dad [had] any intention of my playing hockey until I showed an interest in it myself. Then the light went off. Especially after I improved as his abuse got worse. He saw a connection. He felt what he was doing was working. And it affected my love of hockey. I loved hockey more than I hated the abuse.\n\nBuccigross: Did your dad hit your mom or siblings?\n\nO'Sullivan: My sister a couple of times, not to the degree I got hit. My sister was actually a very good tennis player and played through high school. She and my mom were terrified of my dad as well. But, my mom was invisible to me as a kid. I don't recall anything abusive to her, I just recall lots of yelling. I don't really have a lot of memories of anything because of the abuse. I was in my own world.\n\nBuccigross: What is up with your parents today?\n\nO'Sullivan: My mom filed for divorce once my dad went to jail. I don't talk to her either, but for separate reasons. When I was 25 I got engaged and started thinking about me and my new family I was about to start. I had been giving money to my mother since I signed my first pro contract. I wanted to help her out, as probably anybody would. But once I got engaged and committed to a family, I told her I would help her go to school or something to get set up for a job and support herself, but I wasn't going to just write her checks anymore. She didn't like that and kind of blew up over it. She sent our wedding invitation back and that was kind of the end of it. That was it. I was actually relieved. I was only maintaining a minimal amount of contact because I had to. I know it's hard to live with someone as abusive as my father but, looking back, I think she kind of drank the Kool-Aid, too, and believed what my father was doing. She let it go on for 10 years. I don't know where either of my parents are.\n\nBuccigross: Are you close with your sisters?\n\nO'Sullivan: I have two younger sisters. I don't speak with them or my mother since all the money stuff happened. They basically were in agreement with my mother when all of that happened so they chose to side with her, I guess. I wasn't close to them growing up. I was outside of my house growing up no matter the weather unless my dad said otherwise.\n\nBuccigross: Were your parents affectionate?\n\nO'Sullivan: No. I think I can remember my dad saying \"I love you\" once or twice. My mom was early, but it got less and less. When I would leave for a game she wouldn't say \"I love you,\" she would say \"[You] better play well or the whole family would suffer.\" My mother's parents pretty much supported our family. My dad couldn't keep a job. That's why I hold my mom so responsible for so much of the stuff that was going on. She would be on the phone with her parents asking for money but never mention her husband is terrifying the family and abusing their son. It would have been so easy to say something at some point. Once. Ever.\n\nBuccigross: No other parent or coach ever intervened at what you felt was obvious abuse at the hands of your dad?\n\nO'Sullivan: Zero times until my first [year] of major junior. This is when I would show up with significant marks on my face from our more legit fights. One coach came up and asked, \"What happened to your face?\" I replied, \"You know what happened.\" Then a month later I had the big fight that ended everything. For my book, I went back and asked a lot of old coaches and friends and they all regret the situation and they had an idea but didn't want to believe it. A big reason being I was so productive (148 goals in four years). They couldn't believe someone getting abused could be that good. My dad wasn't dumb, either. He would talk to other parents and socialize and make jokes and laugh with parents.\n\nBuccigross: Do you forgive your parents?\n\nO'Sullivan: I'll put it this way: I no longer have any emotion attached to me as a kid. I don't forgive anybody for anything, especially my parents, but I'm not angry at this point in my life. It took me two years of doing therapy and getting the emotion from the experience removed through that work. I used to be angry, but now it doesn't even cross my mind. I do have dreams occasionally and certain smells and music can bring a flashback of bad memories. But it goes away quickly. I do have a guy I see in Florida every four of five months for maintenance-type purposes. I never had suicidal tendencies or anything like that. I had a \"f--- you\" and \"I'll show you\" attitude my whole life. It really hurt my career near the end, but it's all I knew how to do.\n\nO'Sullivan said the Oilers did not get him help when he told them he wanted to work on his emotional issues. Mike Stobe/NHLI/Getty Images\n\nBuccigross: What is your parental discipline approach to your two children (Henry, age 5, and Nathan, 3)?\n\nO'Sullivan: We use timeouts and take away things from them they like. I don't think a light spank to get your point across is the end of the world. It's not something I'm interested in ... but I know the difference. Abuse is passed down, for sure, but I have put the money and time into my own health. People who don't have the means or time to get healthy don't get healthy. I asked the Edmonton Oilers for some help with my emotional issues. I got traded a month later. When I brought it up, they didn't say a word. Guys with substance abuse issues get multiple chances and people commend them for getting help, as they should. Guys with depression or off-ice issues are looked at totally differently. Players don't feel like they can say anything because it's a huge red flag. You say you need to see a psychologist and you'll get a call from your agent saying he spoke to the GM and wants to know what your 'problem' is. The NHLPA has a great substance abuse program, but good luck getting in touch with someone to help with emotional issues. That's why I did everything on my own when I retired. They are useless. They just want to feed you to people so they get their kickbacks.\n\nBuccigross: What has the reaction been to the now widespread understanding of your story?\n\nO'Sullivan: Before the story really got read last week, bookstores had no real interest in my book. Now they all do. I just think the Players' Tribune piece and social media helped cut through and it wasn't really a hockey story but came from a sports outlet.\n\nMy first year at Mississauga, Don Cherry was the coach. So, while all the s--- with my dad was going on, Cherry was the coach. If you notice in my book he hasn't gotten involved and I didn't involve him. He is on a camera in an interview with the CBC during my draft year saying that he thought my dad was a good guy and he didn't see any of that coming. Don was a big part of my life there at 16, 17 years old. And he's kind of always expressed remorse when I see him. I think it's difficult for him since he supported my dad. He didn't know my details and said he didn't see it coming, but there were other people telling him not to draft me, to find out more about my background. But he saw my dad as a minor leaguer -- like him -- that just wanted his boy, the good Irish boy, to play well. He didn't do his research and I think he regrets that. I don't want to cause any problems for the guy. I put all of those people in one category. It's not looking hard enough at a situation that I felt was obvious. I don't hate them for it. I think it's sad. And I don't want these people coming to me apologizing now. It's too late.

My total focus is on winning and nothing else.\"\n\nAndy Lee-Billy Joe Saunders Where: Manchester Arena in Manchester, England\n\nWhen: Saturday\n\nTV: Showtime Extreme, 5 p.m. ET/PT\n\nSaid Saunders, \"I'm ready to go for Saturday night. This is the best camp that I've ever had. I'm prepared for the toughest test of my career, but I know that I'm in excellent shape to win this fight and become world champion.\"\n\nThe fight was originally scheduled to place on Sept. 19 at Thomond Park in Lee's hometown of Limerick, Ireland, but Lee came down with a virus and the fight was postponed. After it was rescheduled for Oct. 10 at Manchester Arena on Saunders' turf in Manchester, England, he suffered a cut over his right eye during a sparring session, forcing the second postponement.\n\nAfter all the preparation, postponements and incessant hype since the summer, all the southpaws want to do now is get in the ring and finally swing leather at each other on Saturday (Showtime Extreme, 5 p.m. ET/PT, with prime-time replay at 9 p.m. ET/PT) at Manchester Arena.\n\n\"For me it's just another fight, yes, [but] there's a lot stake between us -- my family name and honor, his family name and honor.

What you're going to see on Saturday night is a great, great fight between two of the best 160-pounders in the world.\"\n\nEditor's Picks Lee-Saunders: 'No place in our community for loser' Billy Joe Saunders says the shame of losing the first all-gypsy world title fight will be added motivation ahead of Saturday's fight with Andy Lee.\n\nLee (34-2-1, 24 KOs), 31, won a vacant title with a comeback, one-punch sixth-round knockout of Matt Korobov last December, courtesy of his wicked right hook. On April 11, Lee, a 2004 Irish Olympian, defended the belt in a split draw against Peter Quillin, who was overweight and could not win the title. In that fight, Lee got knocked down twice and Quillin went down once.\n\nSaunders has not been very impressed by Lee's title reign.\n\n\"He was getting beat by Matt Korobov until his punch power got him out of trouble, and he drew with Peter Quillin, which I would have been disgusted with,\" Saunders said. \"I go in to win, not draw. Saturday night is Lee's chance to prove if he is a world champion. I'm the undefeated challenger. If he beats me, then I'll be the first to shake his hand, but as I see it right now, there's only [one] winner: me.\n\n\"There are no doubts in my head at all, and he knows that I'm mentally strong and that he can't get into my head. I was an Olympian at 18 and [I've] beaten everyone put in front of me to come through. I've beaten everyone in Britain and now I just need Andy Lee, who's just another scalp on my record.\"\n\nBut Lee comes into this fight as the man with the bigger punch. He knows it. Saunders (22-0, 12 KOs) knows it. Everybody knows it.\n\nAndy Lee, right, was dropped twice in his April title defense against Peter Quillin before settling for a split draw. Elsa/Getty Images\n\n\"I have a punch that can end a fight, lights out, in any given second,\" Lee said. \"I won't rely on the punch. I will look to dominate from the start with educated pressure. I'm feeling very dangerous at the moment. Saunders' unbeaten record is a disadvantage. He has always been in fights he's expected to win and has been well managed by [Frank] Warren.\n\n\"I've never lost a fight on points and I never will on points. If I'm down on the cards, I will go out swinging in the last round.\"\n\nThe 26-year-old Saunders, a 2008 British Olympian, has been expected to become a top contender since he turned pro in early 2009. He passed one test after another and earned his first world title shot with his biggest win in November 2014, getting the nod in a spirited split decision against bitter rival Chris Eubank Jr. in a European title defense that also served as the world title eliminator that earned him the shot against Lee.\n\nThat fight was big for him. This one is obviously even more significant for Saunders, who won a tune-up fight in July by knocking out journeyman Yoann Bloyer in the fourth round.\n\n\"Andy Lee is a tough fighter. He has proved that by becoming world champion and having the type of career he has had,\" said Saunders, who went away to Spain to train. \"But I'm undefeated and hungry and know that I'm on the brink of fulfilling a childhood dream. I'm not going to leave that ring without the title.\"\n\nLee, of course, also has every intention of winning and leaving the ring with the belt -- knowing the winner will be in prime position to land a big-money unification fight with Gennady Golovkin or Daniel Jacobs in the first half of 2016.\n\n\"I am in a good frame of mind, I am the champion, I have the title, and the pressure is all on Billy Joe to try and take it off me,\" Lee said. \"And that's not going to happen.\"", "NHL -- Commissioner Pierre LeBrun suggests changes to the league": "During this Christmas break, as we pause and reflect, I am going to take a few minutes to bring you my vision for the NHL. There are things I would like to change on and off the ice. So if I could convince the NHL, its owners and the NHLPA, here's what I envision:\n\n1. Limit the outdoor game to the Winter Classic on Jan. 1 and no others. The event is being watered down by having a number of outdoor games every season. The New Year's Day game is a perfect date, it's a special game. But to preserve its value and quality long-term, the NHL and NHLPA must set aside their appetite for revenue and limit it to just one game. That would give the Winter Classic a longer shelf life. Less is more, as they say.\n\n2. Shrink the end zones to where they were before the blue line was pushed out in 2005-06. This one comes courtesy of the great Scotty Bowman. The neutral zone was shrunk from 54 feet to 50 feet in 2005, the idea being that the bigger zones from the blue line in would allow for more offense. But now all you get is five players collapsing down low to block shots. Bowman's idea is that if we go back to old dimensions, maybe the wingers would have to cover defensemen like they used to and open up more ice underneath. Not to mention point men would be closer to the net when taking their shots. When in doubt, trust the NHL's all-time winningest coach.\n\nWould smaller end zones lead to more scoring? Bruce Bennett/Getty Images\n\n3. Put the center red line back in as far as counting two-line passes. This one comes from a Hockey Hall of Famer who shall remain nameless, as per his request. But his contention is that with no red line, all defensemen have to do these days is bang the puck off the glass in the hope of hitting their forwards in the neutral zone. He feels that if you put the center red line back in, defensemen will be under more pressure to make a play, a real pass, so as to avoid the two-line pass, and that should lead to more mistakes and therefore more scoring opportunities off those. I agree.\n\n4. Move to fully independent concussions spotters. I think the league is on the way there after this season anyway, but this idea that teams can use either their own club spotters or league spotters must stop. For the health of the players, who are their own worst enemies sometimes, independent league spotters should be the only ones in charge to make sure players who look woozy after a big hit leave the game for observation. Take this out of the hands of the teams and out of the hands of the players. While we're on this subject, as I wrote recently, let's also curb fighting further by making a fighting major accompanied by an automatic game misconduct. I think this one is self-explanatory in a world in which we are so concerned about head injuries.\n\nNone of today's teams are like the high-flying Habs teams of the 1950s, so make them serve out a full penalty regardless of if a goal is scored. Michael Martin/NHLI/Getty Images\n\n5. Have a penalized player serve the full two-minute penalty regardless of whether the other team scores. You might remember it's because of the high-flying Montreal Canadiens teams of the 1950s that the rule was changed in 1956-57 to allow the penalized player to leave the box if the other team scored on the power play. We need more goals, right? Let's have players serve the full two minutes no matter what. San Jose Sharks captain Joe Pavelski was intrigued by this suggestion when I shared it with him earlier this month.\n\n6. Schedule the draft and the opening of free agency on the same weekend. I've pushed for this for years. Think of the buzz the baseball winter meetings get with all the wheeling and dealing. This would be hockey's version. Listen, all the agents and team executives are in the same city for the draft every year in late June. My idea is that once the draft wraps up Saturday, the official opening of free agency is Sunday, while everyone is there. I would have teams stay put Sunday and Monday and then use Tuesday as the travel day. Normally the third day of free agency is a bit of a pause anyway as teams huddle back up, either because they're done signing players or because they've struck out and need a Plan C. Imagine the buzz of seeing general managers and agents and perhaps unrestricted free agents all in the same rink or hotel making deals. Come on, tell me that isn't a great idea. Plus the bonus would be no longer having free agency open on July 1, which is a national holiday in Canada. It's brutal that free agency opens that day. Get all the signings done by late June, and everyone wins.\n\nThe NHL should take advantage of every team being in the same room and open free agency when the draft ends. Steve Mitchell/USA TODAY Sports\n\n7. Start the regular season earlier by two weeks, which means ending the playoffs earlier by two weeks. I think we can all agree the Stanley Cup needs to be awarded by May 31. There's just something wrong with hockey in June. It has never felt right. There's nothing wrong with starting the season in late September. Shorten preseason if you have to. But a season that ends by May 31 would be universally welcomed by players and fans alike.\n\n8. Extend the holiday trade freeze. The holiday roster freeze runs Dec. 19-27. Here's my thinking: If you freeze trades between Dec. 10 and Jan. 10, I bet you might see more teams try to get things done before Dec. 10 for fear of losing their opportunity at a deal they've been nibbling at. Case in point, the NHL has a trade freeze during the Olympics every four years, and there are often trades made before the freeze, like the year the Carolina Hurricanes traded for Doug Weight before the Olympic break in Torino, Italy, and ended up winning the Cup that June. I just have this feeling that a month-long trade freeze from Dec. 10 to Jan. 10 would produce a bit of a mini-frenzy. Not to mention that players would likely appreciate the peace of mind heading into the holidays for longer than just eight days as it stands now.\n\n9. Create a minor penalty for a team that doesn't pursue the puck carrier; in other words, penalize teams that sit back. This one comes courtesy of the O-Dog, former 40-goal scorer Jeff O'Neill, who works alongside me at TSN. I'm not sure exactly how you would come up with the criteria but likely there's a time element or zone presence on the ice involved -- like a variation of basketball's illegal defense. There's something in here, I think, and O'Neill's point is that you want to have teams play more aggressively, which also leads to more mistakes and more entertainment.\n\n10. Cancel the All-Star Game. Enough said.", "Al Jazeera defends HGH report naming Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning": "Tedy Bruschi compares what Tom Brady went through with Deflategate to what Peyton Manning is going through now with the Al Jazeera report. (1:17)\n\nDeborah Davies, an investigative reporter for Al Jazeera who produced a recent report on athletes and performance-enhancing drugs, defended the network's reporting Tuesday during an appearance on NBC's Today show.\n\nAl Jazeera reported Sunday that Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning was one of several high-profile athletes who were supplied performance-enhancing drugs by an Indianapolis anti-aging clinic. The network reported that human growth hormone was sent to Manning's house in Florida in 2011 while he was recovering from neck surgery. Al Jazeera reported that the shipments were addressed to Manning's wife, Ashley.\n\nManning said Sunday he was \"furious\" and \"disgusted\" by the report and said he has never used HGH. Manning did acknowledge that he received treatment at the Guyer Institute, however.\n\nOn Tuesday, Davies said she never alleged that Manning used HGH, but reported that the substance was \"repeatedly sent\" to Manning's wife. Davies said Manning has not denied that HGH was shipped to his wife.\n\nPeyton Manning said Monday he was \"furious\" and \"disgusted\" by Al Jazeera's report and said he has never used HGH. AP Photo/Jack Dempsey\n\nLater, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Manning, issued this statement: \"Al Jazeera is backtracking and retreating. Their story was not credible to begin with and it's not credible now. Within 48 hours of the broadcast, Deborah Davies is now contradicting her own reporting.\"\n\nDavies also defended her source for the story, pharmacy student Charlie Sly, saying he was credible. Sly has since recanted his allegations to ESPN and others.\n\nLate Monday, Al Jazeera released a video recording of Davies calling the Guyer Institute and asking for employment dates for Sly, whom the network reported was a pharmacist there in 2011, while Manning received treatment. The woman who answered the phone at the clinic told Davies that Sly was employed at the clinic as an intern beginning on Oct. 17, 2011. Sly and the director of the clinic have both said that Sly was an intern at the clinic for three months in 2013.\n\nESPN asked Guyer for comment on the video but has not received a response.", "Warriors' rise highlights Top 10 stories of 2015": "Goodbye, 2015. You were fun.\n\nNot as momentous as 2014 (David Stern retires; Adam Silver kicks Donald Sterling out of the league, etc.). Not as hair-rendering as 2011, which ended with a lockout. Not as inspiring as 2013, when the Spurs showed incredible character and won their most special of championships. No, just good old-fashioned fun.\n\nConsider LeBron James, going back home to try and end a 51-year championship drought, and all the hope he represents. Look at James Harden, barreling into people like a human pinball, scoring at will, drawing fouls. Take a gander at that first-round series between the Clippers and Spurs -- basketball at its best for seven great games, until Chris Paul came in on a bad hammy and willed his team to victory. See the Hawks whip the ball around, side to side, until Kyle Korver comes off of some impossible, 90-degree angle, and catches and shoots, seemingly in one motion, for another 3.\n\nAnd come out to the Bay. The East Bay, where the most exciting show on hardwood is appearing, nightly.\n\nThere is the light-skinned brother, who doesn't look any bigger than your uncle, no taller than your mailman, who doesn't seem to miss, ever, no matter from where he's shooting. His running mate, the taller dude, stays outside, but he rarely misses, either. He scores in bunches -- big bunches. There is the whirling dervish of energy, always pounding his chest, making 3s, getting rebounds, playing outstanding defense. He was a second-round pick? Really? And an assortment of talented, determined teammates that play hard, defend, make shots, as they win and win and win.\n\nAre you not entertained? Why, yes, you are!\n\nThe Warriors became appointment television as the league prepared for an explosion of new income -- $24 billion, starting in 2016, from its television partners. They were the embodiment of two decades' worth of new rules, designed to eliminate the physicality that had dominated the game in the '80s and early '90s, and a change in philosophy leaguewide that believed 3-pointers were not only more valuable and better shots to take than almost all twos, they were easier. So Golden State shot and shot and shot -- but also stopped and stopped and stopped. They became a team for the new millennium -- the league's best offensive and defensive team, even though they weren't especially big or physical. What they were, was quick. And smart. And tough, pushed to their best by their first-year coach, Steve Kerr.\n\nGolden State was just one story, though, in a year full of moments.\n\nHere were the Top 10:\n\n10) Ponce de LePierce. Paul Pierce was 37 years old on opening night 2014, a late signing by the Washington Wizards, who hoped they could squeeze a decent season out of him at small forward. Frankly, though he started 73 games, he didn't look so hot in the regular season, averaging a career-low 11.9 points. Then came the playoffs, and a switch by those devilish Wizards, who moved Pierce to power forward, playing Otto Porter at the three. Then, Pierce opened his yap before Washington's first-round series, saying Toronto didn't have the necessities to win in the playoffs. Then, he ushered the Raps out of the series with a Game 3 dagger. After the Wizards completed the sweep, Pierce trolled Toronto into the offseason. Then, he rescued a John Wall-less Washington in Game 3 against Atlanta, with a last-second game-winner and one of the great walkoff interviews of all time. Then, he almost won Game 5 in Atlanta, putting the Wizards up by one with seconds left, but the Wiz couldn't keep Al Horford off the glass for the game-winner. Then, Pierce was half a second late from tying Game 6 back in D.C. It was the greatest fortnight of clutch shotmaking for the Washington franchise in almost 40 years. The man is still The Truth.\n\nSeries Recap: Raptors-Wizards Take a look back at the first-round series of the Washington Wizards four-game sweep over the Toronto Raptors.\n\n9) Big Bucks. After years of gentle persuasion/threat, the Bucks convince the powers in the state, led by Gov. Scott Walker, to put their political capital behind a financing plan for a new arena to replace the aging BMO Harris Bradley Center, to be completed in time for the 2017-18 season. The alternative, as laid out by the NBA when it approved the sale of the team to hedge fund billionaires Wes Edens and Marc Lasry in 2014, was that the league could buy the team back from Edens and Lasry and sell it to anyone -- including those who might move the team out of town. The Bucks and supporters from both parties argued that the state would never recover the taxes that it receives from the Bucks and other NBA teams that play in the state through the so-called \"jock tax\" that is in Wisconsin and many other states. Bills providing for $250 million in public funds toward the estimated $500 million arena -- which will supposedly be a catalyst for a redevelopment of a large downtown swath of the city -- were passed by the Wisconsin State Senate and Assembly in separate July votes. Lasry and Edens have committed $150 million toward the new building; former owner Herb Kohl has pledged an additional $100 million. With Sacramento's new arena scheduled to open in 2016, there aren't any franchises at present that are in danger of relocation -- a blow to Seattle, which is still looking for a team to bring back to the Emerald City.\n\n8) Resolved ... the Hawks Get Sold. After months of uncertainty following the disclosure of a racially insensitive email by majority owner Bruce Levenson and the repeating of a racially insensitive stereotype by general manager Danny Ferry, the Atlanta Hawks are sold to a group led by billionaire Tony Ressler for $850 million. The sale comes in the midst of the most successful season in franchise history, with the Hawks sending four players to the All-Star Game, winning 60 games in the regular season and reaching the Eastern Conference finals. The Hawks revamp their game operations, marketing and outreach to the city, dramatically improving attendance at Philips Arena (a franchise-record 25 sellouts) and making the team's Twitter account a daily must-read. The Hawks are among the leaders in the pace and space revolution, finishing in the top 10 in 3-point attempts, makes and percentage. In the wake of the sale, Ferry -- who'd been on leave all season -- settles with the Hawks and leaves the organization, with assistant GM Wes Wilcox becoming general manager, and coach Mike Budenholzer getting a new deal that gave him control of the team as president of basketball operations.\n\n7) A Man in Full. In his 30th year, LeBron James continued to dominate the NBA, reaching the Finals for a fifth straight season, this time with the Cavaliers. The passive-aggressive dance with his new coach, David Blatt, throughout the regular season was eclipsed by James' performance during the Finals. Without the injured Kevin Love, and with Kyrie Irving injured during Game 1 against Golden State, James was remarkable: 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, 8.8 assists per game. And off the court, he seemed to be as comfortable with himself and his place in the world as he's ever been. He got a lifetime contract from Nike. He jumped full bore into the issues facing his peers, becoming First Vice President of the National Basketball Players Association. He continued to feel comfortable speaking out on social issues of the day, something that superstars of his ilk have been reluctant to do for decades. As the 2015 season began, James remained the controlling voice of the Cavs' organization and remained as obsessed as ever with bringing a championship to \"the Land.\"\n\n6) Goodbye, Farewell and Amen. The death of Flip Saunders at 60 in November from complications stemming from cancer treatment knocks the wind out of the league. One, it was sudden; his diagnosis wasn't announced publicly until August, and at the time, it was believed it was treatable. Two, few people enjoyed a sunnier reputation than Flip, a lifer who played at the University of Minnesota, learned his coaching chops in the CBA and displayed offensive genius through all of his NBA stops over two decades. He did all of that with a smile on his face most days, a kind word for an opponent, an occasionally overstated word for his own players (every other guy was \"like KG\" in one way or another), and a love for the game that never wavered. The real gut punch was that Flip had finally started to turn the Timberwolves back toward respectability, with back-to-back No. 1 picks Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns forming the franchise's new foundation. For education, Saunders had dipped into the old steel, bringing Garnett back last year for one last go-round -- more coach than player, more mentor than teammate -- along with Andre Miller and Tayshaun Prince this past summer. Everything was in place. Everything, tragically, except Flip Saunders.\n\nRemembering Phil \"Flip\" Saunders Vince Cellini remembers the life and career of coach Flip Saunders.\n\n5) Or I'll Dress You in Mourning. The 76ers suffered through a horrible season, going 18-64, and not getting the first pick in the Draft for their troubles. But that paled next to the tragedies that struck their alumni, one seemingly after another. In June, Harvey Pollack, the team's longtime statistician and publicist -- the longest-serving person working for the NBA, since its inaugural season in 1947 -- died at age 93. On Aug. 27, Darryl Dawkins died of a heart attack. Less than three weeks later, Hall of Famer Moses Malone died of natural causes, stemming from cardiovascular disease. And earlier this month, Hall of Famer Dolph Schayes, who coached the 76ers for three seasons in the early '60s, died of cancer at age 87.\n\n4) The Sunset of the Mamba. After 20 years, more than 32,000 points and five NBA championships, Kobe Bryant announced in November that this would, indeed, be his final season with the Lakers. He is the only player in NBA history to play two decades with the same team, which manipulated a Draft day trade in 1996 to get the high school phenom from Lower Merion High School in suburban Philadelphia. Bryant's departure is as polarizing as much of the rest of his career; his rapid decline as a player after the numerous injuries he's suffered the past few years has been chronicled throughout the blogosphere, and was the backdrop for the beginning of his farewell tour around the league. As with many things, the divide on Bryant's denouement fell along generational lines, with older fans more forgiving of his low shooting percentages because of his past successes, while younger fans decried his high usage as slowing or stopping the development of the Lakers' young players. Regardless of how this season ends, Bryant's impact on one of sports' glamour franchises is unassailable, as is his status as one of the top dozen or so people to ever play the game.\n\nInside The NBA: Kobe Bryant Interview Future Hall of Famer and 5-time NBA champion Kobe Bryant talks with TNT's Ernie Johnson about his legendary career and leaving the game he loves.\n\n3) All in for LaMarcus. The Spurs, more than anyone, know that the post-Duncan/Parker/Ginobili era is upon them. They spent the better part of two seasons planning for the Summer of 2015, when they'd have enough cap room to add a max free agent to pair with their young emerging superstar, Kawhi Leonard -- himself due a max contract extension. But the timing had to be perfect. There were so many moving parts -- other free agents who San Antonio wanted to retain would have to wait, and the Spurs would need to create additional cap room to make a full-throated run at a special player. And if they failed to get it done, there wasn't really a credible Plan B. Yet it all fell into place, one move after the next, in a perfectly orchestrated example of how the best organization in sports does its business. Leonard got his max, guard Danny Green took less than market value to stay. And ultimately, the Spurs got their man -- Portland's LaMarcus Aldridge -- after a no-frills presentation led by Gregg Popovich, with his Big Four in tow. The Spurs have a future because no one deals with the present better.\n\n2) DeAndre Jordan's Wild Ride. If Aldridge's free agency was a sober, subdued process, Jordan's was positively Kardashian -- clubbing and fancy restaurants with Mark Cuban and Chandler Parsons, Emojis at 20 paces when Jordan reneged on a verbal agreement to join the Mavericks, and decided to return to the Clippers. Teams around the league were angered by the display\u2014not because Jordan wasn't allowed to change his mind, but because of the silliness of the social media-dominant coverage of the Clips' re-pursuit of their star center, his unwillingness to deal directly with Cuban and the Mavericks when he did, and because his back-and-forth left the Mavs scrambling to sign replacement free agents. What happened to Dallas could happen to anyone. There was at least talk of shortening the free agent moratorium in the future so that teams in Dallas' position aren't as hamstrung if a player has a change of heart.\n\n1) Golden. The Warriors weren't just a great team in 2015, they were a cause, a movement, a validation of the trailblazing offensive style of Mike D'Antoni with the Suns -- a style that failed to break through in Phoenix with a championship. In the Bay, however, the Warriors become the NBA's dominant team, with a unique cast of players led by MVP Stephen Curry and power forward Draymond Green. No one has ever shot the ball as well, or from as many different spots on the floor, as Curry; few 6-6 players like Green have shown his ability to guard virtually any opponent. Green's versatility allows the Warriors to switch freely on defense, knowing there will be few mismatches -- and that Andrew Bogut is in the back to challenge anyone who breaks free. Golden State immolated the West, winning 67 games in the regular season, and through good fortune and the collapse of the Clippers in the playoffs, had favorable matchups through the Finals. And the Warriors showed a champion's heart and guts after falling down 2-1 to Cleveland, with Steve Kerr changing his lineup, benching Bogut in favor of Andre Iguodala, with Green taking Bogut's place at center in order to create more pace and get better shots. It works. The Warriors averaged 97.3 points in the first three games of the Finals; they average 104 points in the next three. They shot 41.4 percent in the first three games (and 31 percent on threes); they shoot 46 percent in the last three games (and 41 percent on threes). Golden State wipes the Cavs out in six games, for the franchise's first title in 40 years. Iguodala's two-way play earns him Finals MVP honors. And a new It team is born in the Association.\n\nAll-Access: 2015 NBA Finals An all-access journey through the 2015 NBA Finals as the Golden State Warriors won their first championship in four decades, by defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers, 4-2\n\nDRIBBLES\n\nThe goggles make Kelly Oubre look like he's about to go scuba diving.\n\nHe is alone on the Washington Wizards' practice court with assistant coach David Adkins. No one else is there. But in his headset, Oubre can see the jumpers he took on the floor just a few seconds earlier. The difference is, the film wasn't shot from the sidelines, or from the end zones. Oubre sees himself shooting from his point of view -- the ballboy who throws him the ball, his hands coming into the shot to catch the entry pass, the shot going into the basket.\n\nAnd if Oubre turns all the way around with the gear on, he can see ... himself. Shooting.\n\nIt's not some 3D movie. The Wizards are hoping to set the trend in the NBA with the latest piece of next-generation technology in sports: virtual reality.\n\nWashington is the first NBA team to utilize STRIVR, a virtual reality system developed by a Stanford professor and a former Cardinal football player to simulate the playing experience for the user. A series of GoPro video cameras are binded together to provide a 360-degree view -- a person wearing the goggles can look behind them and see people or things standing there, as they actually were.\n\nThe Wizards (and their fellow NHL Capitals) utilize STRIVR to help their players see action in real time, without having to grind through a practice. It allows players to \"study\" the team's playbook with the \"real\" players, not X's and O's on a page. It allows players who aren't getting much playing time to continue working on their games.\n\nIt's hard to explain in words. You have to put the headset on.\n\nIn the case of Oubre, he can see John Wall and Marcin Gortat starting a pick and roll action, and see where he should go on the floor. Or, he can watch an out of bounds play, either from the perspective of the passer or the recipient. Or, he can see what he looks like shooting a corner three, to look at where his feet are, how he catches the pass, if his shooting form is correct.\n\n\"Coming into the year, this summer, this past summer, I just recently started breaking down film,\" Oubre said, \"watching numerous film of other guys that I would be playing against -- not necessarily stealing some of their stuff, but watching what they do, watching their tendencies. And that kind of carried over here, working with DA. We started using the visual, and I've been getting better.\"\n\nOubre told the Wizards in pre-Draft meetings that he was a visual learner, that he retained more when he was shown something than when he was told something. Coming from a generation of gamers, who play VR games all the time, having Oubre use STRIVR was a no-brainer.\n\nAdkins started working out with Oubre in July in Los Angeles, after the Wizards arranged for a Draft night trade to get Oubre from the Knicks. Adkins first noticed that Oubre crow-hopped into his shot, so he asked him why he didn't try a one-two step? Oubre didn't know what that was. After Atkins showed him tape, he picked it up quickly.\n\n\"My job is to find out how does he learn,\" Adkins said \" ... With him, I realized early, in our video department, we got film to show him. And then when this came about, a couple of weeks before training camp, he was really excited about it. And that's half the battle. If he's that interested, then it's up to us to utilize anything possible to help him learn. And as you know, young people learn by being entertained now. It's not like when we were in school. You have to entertain them. So if this helps, and it helps him see right away, the proof is in what he does, not what we do. He's able to see what he does, and correct it on the floor.\"\n\nOubre takes some more shots, then goes back to the headgear, looks at his mechanics, then goes back on the floor.\n\n\"Quality over quantity,\" Atkins says, as Oubre repeats his shooting drills. Oubre is a little uncomfortable with the catch on the corner 3.\n\n\"How do we fix that?,\" Atkins asks.\n\n\"Get lower, make sure my hands are ready,\" Oubre says.\n\nVR is not for everyone. Older players are a little more set in their ways and know what they're doing on the floor most of the time. But it's going to be a big part of the NBA's future.\n\nVirtual reality has been on the league's radar since Commissioner Adam Silver came on stage at last year's Tech Summit during All-Star Weekend in New York wearing a VR headset. While VR use in sports is still in its nascent stages, its potential is already moving the needle at some of the world's biggest companies; in 2014, Facebook spent $2.3 billion to buy Oculus, the company that makes the headset the Wizards use.\n\nThe league partnered with Samsung to give the company access to NBA content at All-Star, including the Slam Dunk and three-point contests, which were available to view live with Samsung's Gear VR headset. (Full disclosure: the NBA and Gear also are business partners with Turner Sports, which pays my salary and runs NBA.com. Turner's TNT livestreamed the Warriors' regular season opener in October; the stream was accessible to viewers with the headsets, who got a 180-degree view of the championship ring ceremony and game in real time.)\n\nIn October, the Kings announced an equity stake in Voke, a California-based VR company that also livestreams events like Ricky Martin concerts, as well as on demand video. Voke livestreamed the Kings-Clippers game in October to viewers in India and California who wore the Oculus Rift gear.\n\nThe technology has been messed around with for more than two decades, but has been significantly improved through the research and work of Stanford professor Jeremy Bailenson, the founding director of Stanford's Virtual Human Interaction Lab. The Lab examines the interactions among people in what it calls \"immersive virtual reality simulations.\"\n\nVR, Bailenson said in an e-mail Monday, basically tricks the brain into thinking what you're seeing is real -- but without the actual consequences. Bailenson found that VR helped people get over fears of flying and of public speaking, and helped them remember and learn at an accelerated rate compared with more traditional methods of teaching. As such, it can be a great teaching tool: \"mistakes are free in VR,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The way to think about VR is as an experience,\" he said in the e-mail. \"People who are new to the medium consider it to be a 'media experience,' like watching TV. But, when done well, VR is much closer to an 'actual experience' than anything we have seen in the history of simulation. The brain has not yet evolved to differentiate compelling virtual reality from physical experiences. Hence, virtual practice reps are an approximation of actual ones, when conducted properly in well-designed VR.\"\n\nOne of Bailenson's Masters program students, Derek Belch, was a former kicker for the Cardinal (he kicked the game-winning extra point in Stanford's 2007 upset of then-No. 1 USC). The teacher and pupil both wanted to see if VR had any application for use in football.\n\n\"Many applications actually don't work well in VR -- the written word and video are actually quite effective for a majority of media experiences,\" Bailenson said. \"But when Derek and I put together the first QB trainer and showed it to a head coach, his eyes lit up. It is simply the right tool for the job.\"\n\nBelch agreed to make the study his Master's thesis. The two then met with Stanford coach David Shaw in 2014.\n\nShaw was intrigued enough not to dismiss the idea out of hand. After some fits and starts with where to place the cameras, the video quality and other issues, Bailenson and his group figured out what worked. The cameras that produced the 360-degree views were placed near the quarterback. Shooting later in the day, when the sun was a little lower, produced better video quality.\n\nMost importantly, Stanford's quarterback, Kevin Hogan, started getting much better results after using the headsets for about 20 minutes a day after practice. The VR picture Hogan saw augmented the \"All 22\" that is a staple of football film watching. All 22 shows every player on the field and what they do before and after the ball is snapped, but in order to get all 22 players on offense and defense (hence the name) in the shot, it has to be taken from high above the practice or game field.\n\nBy contrast, the VR shot gave Hogan an All 22 look -- but from his actual perspective behind the center. He could see the safeties creeping up in front of him, and then turn around and see his running backs behind him.\n\nAfter seeing how Hogan and Stanford improved, Bailenson and Belch started STRIVR Labs, and expanded both their company and the teams and leagues that used their technology. Almost all of the Pac12 is now on board, as well as other teams around the country. After demonstrating the VR at the NFL's Draft Combine last February, seven NFL teams -- including the Patriots, Cowboys, 49ers, Jets and Cardinals --are using Oculus.\n\nThe Wizards found out about STRIVR from Dan Grunfeld, the son of Washington general manager Ernie Grunfeld and who played college basketball at Stanford.\n\n\"My son calls me up and says, 'One of my classmates who I went to Stanford with has been working on virtual reality, and it's really cool, you can't believe it, you have to be able to see it,'\" Ernie Grunfeld said. \"So I said, 'You're right; I can't believe it.' So we set something up when we were going out to Summer League [in Las Vegas last July]. They came out and gave us a presentation, and it really was a cool thing. It was something so different. And you felt like you were really in the middle of the action ... as soon as I saw it, I felt this was something that maybe we could use to develop our players, and maybe develop a playbook and things of that nature.\"\n\nIt was an easy sell to Wizards owner Ted Leonsis, whose WNBA Mystics will also use STRIVR.\n\n\"Both of our teams have young video coaches,\" Leonsis said. \"They've grown up with it. They were really excited about it. And that's what we're seeing -- the younger the coach, the younger the player. And some of the older players, it's like 'I'm from Missouri -- show me.' The adaption over the years will be easiest with the younger players and the younger coaches.\"\n\nThe Wizards were among the first teams to use SportVU, the series of cameras that track movement of every player on the floor, measuring things how much a player runs during a game, the length of every pass and shot taken, and the like. The NBA mandated that the SportVU technology be available to all teams, and had cameras put in every arena in 2013.\n\nLeonsis sees a similar future for STRIVR.\n\n\"We saw that with SportVU,\" Leonsis said. \"There were a couple, and we were one of the first, and then there were 10 for a couple of years, and then people started to complain that maybe we were building data sets and maps that were giving us an unfair advantage ... so I think we'll have some advantage early on. While we did it for some competitive advantage, it's really that we want our players to be the best that they can be, and any investment we can make, and tools that will help them, I think is important.\"\n\nA co-founder of America Online, Leonsis has not put any of his own money into STRIVR yet. \"But my venture capital company really believes in virtual reality,\" he said. \"We think it's a hot market. That Facebook bought Oculus a couple of years ago, and everybody said, 'Why? What are they going to do with it?' Well, you can see putting this on and being able to play multi-user games, and literally being able to go into a battlefield, or playing some kind of fantasy game together. Movie-making will go to this. You can see how episodic TV will be changed. You can see how socializing, seeing family members, seeing how medicine will change. I really do believe this is the birth of a new industry, and we just want to be the early adopter and pioneer in sports.\"\n\nThe Wizards have loaded the STRIVR unit with their entire playbook, available at the touch of a button. If they add a new play, or a wrinkle, or a late-game ATO during the season, it goes into STRIVR. It allows players to experience practice in a league where practice time is at a minimum once the regular season starts.\n\nThe Wizards beefed up their basketball operations department to add a full-time staffer who sets up the VR shoots and equipment, under the aegis of Director of Basketball Analytics Brett Greenberg. And Wizards Coach Randy Wittman has worked VR time into practice.\n\nNothing replaces repetition. And I don't want our guys to think this is a shortcut to success. You can get visualization of your shot, shooting the ball. That can help some. But by just putting the goggles on, that doesn't make you a better shooter. You've still got to go on the court and put the time in -- repetition, repetition. \u2013 Wizards coach Randy Wittman\n\n\"It's intriguing,\" Wittman said. \"I'm always skeptical a little bit. My main thing is trying to get the people who know what the technology is. Can it help a player, is the number one thing. So as this has moved on and we've incorporated it into our setting, I wanted to try and incorporate our plays. Can a player put these goggles on and see Thumb Down, and know where he's supposed to be and what he's supposed to do. And I've seen some of that.\"\n\nWittman doesn't know all the verbiage of STRIVR -- \"I know it's not PlayStation or Game Box, whatever they do now,\" he said -- but he's signed off on his players using it.\n\nHaving Atkins run the STRIVR session with Oubre is by design. Wittman doesn't want his voice dominating the VR sessions -- \"they hear my voice enough,\" Wittman said. \"I want to visualize them talking. We can do a lot of different things, from communication defensively and hearing that, rather than hearing me. They hear me enough.\"\n\nWittman was a sweet-shooting swingman himself, and he appreciates and understands the benefit of a shooter being able to see the ball go into the basket. So he's fine with his players using VR ... to a point.\n\n\"Nothing replaces repetition,\" Wittman said. \"And I don't want our guys to think this is a shortcut to success. You can get visualization of your shot, shooting the ball. That can help some. But by just putting the goggles on, that doesn't make you a better shooter. You've still got to go on the court and put the time in -- repetition, repetition.\"\n\nIt's hard to prove cause and effect with a rookie. But injuries have forced Oubre into the Wizards' lineup much sooner than they expected or hoped. But his understanding of the team's sets and coverages seems to be improving daily. He's showing repeatable form on his jumper. He's contributing. Is it because of STRIVR, or because he's on the floor with an All-Star in Wall, and is often wide open? Who knows? But it certainly hasn't hurt.\n\n\"My biggest takeaway is being able to see the mechanics, the whole mechanics of my shot, or whatever we're doing,\" Oubre said. \"You can use this doing whatever -- close outs, jump shot, ballhandling, things like that. Just being able to visually see what I need to do, what works for me when I'm doing that specific move or shot, it's helpful. Because I can go out and rep the right stuff. I'm not repping bad habits.\"\n\n(previous rank in brackets; last week's record in parenthesis)\n\n1) Golden State [1] (2-0): After beating Cleveland on Christmas Day, the Warriors are 14-0 at Oracle. Next five at home: Sacramento, Denver, Charlotte, Miami, Lakers. It's not possible Golden State could still have no home blemishes before hosting Indiana on Jan. 22, followed by the Spurs on Jan. 25?\n\n2) San Antonio [2] (3-1): Why wasn't I told about this immediately after it happened? This is brilliant. And as someone trapped in the '80s emotionally, I especially appreciate the A Team motif. (And, I swear, I did not know I was immortalized in Episode 1 until I went back and looked.)\n\n3) Oklahoma City [4] (3-1): Billy Donovan trying to find a combination when KD/W'Brook aren't on the floor that works.\n\n4) Cleveland [3] (1-2): The Cavs must have spent all day Saturday at the Nike Employee Store in Beaverton before getting pummeled Saturday night by the Blazers.\n\n5) Atlanta [12] (3-0): Hawks Gonna Hawk: during Atlanta's six-game win streak, in which it has averaged 111.5 points per game, no player has scored more than 23 points. But in each game, at least five players have scored in double figures.\n\n6) Miami [5] (2-1): Is it time to officially start being concerned about Josh McRoberts' knee?\n\n7) Toronto [8] (2-0): Jonas Valanciunas tells local reporters he may be back in the lineup Monday against the Bulls, after missing 17 games with a broken left hand.\n\n8) Dallas [7] (2-1): J.J.

More importantly, the Wiz have held their last four opponents to 96.8 points per game, after allowing 111 per game in their previous four.\n\nTEAM OF THE WEAK\n\nPhoenix (0-3): You have to ask why? But the home loss to previously 1-30 Philly on Saturday aside (if that's possible), the wheels look to be coming off in the Valley of the Sun. Markieff Morris was suspended two games last week after throwing a towel at coach Jeff Hornacek, whose job is reportedly in jeopardy. Eric Bledsoe injured his knee Saturday and is expected to miss several weeks. The Suns are 1-7 in their last eight. Happy New Year!\n\nNOBODY ASKED ME, BUT ...\n\nWhy did Mike Conley get the urge to dunk?\n\nDunks from the Grizzlies' point guard are quite rare, to the point where there are just as many YouTube hits of his father, Mike Sr., dunking in '90s Foot Locker Slam Fest contests as there are of him during his years in Memphis. But after Philly's T.J. McConnell inexplicably ran into Vince Carter near midcourt during last week's game in Philly, Conley wound up with the ball and had a breakaway. Carter was trailing, but Conley threw it down.\n\n\"I had the option to throw it to Vince,\" Conley said, \"but we have to save Vince's legs.\"\n\nThere is change spreading through the Grizzlies these days, the result of an aging core and the realization that the days of Grit 'N' Grind -- the beautiful moniker that so aptly pegged Memphis' old-school, low-post, defensive-first game of recent vintage -- are waning. The Grizz still want to defend, and they still want to play through All-Star Marc Gasol. But the means to achieve those ends are changing.\n\nCoach Dave Joerger took mainstays Zach Randolph and Tony Allen out of the starting lineup in mid-December, replacing them with Matt Barnes and Courtney Lee, with Jeff Green moving from small forward to power forward.\n\nThe changes came as Memphis tried to get some momentum going in a season that's gotten off to a lousy start by the franchise's recent standards.\n\nComing off of three straight 50-win seasons, the Grizzlies have had several humiliating defeats in the first two months of the season -- losing by 30 at FedEx Forum in their home opener to Cleveland, losing by 50 (!) and 16 points to the Warriors, by 19 at Portland and separate home losses to Atlanta (15 points), San Antonio (20) and Charlotte (24).\n\nChange is inevitable everywhere, but that doesn't mean it's been easy to try and put pace and space into what has been the NBA's most successful outlier -- a throwback franchise that bludgeoned opponents with Gasol and Randolph on offense, and took almost everything you wanted away on defense.\n\nIt doesn't mean that Randolph, Allen and Gasol will never be on the floor together again: they were out there in the fourth quarter Saturday in Charlotte, and will be in a lot of crunch times going forward. But the Grizzlies will look to attack defenses differently.\n\n\"Well, you know, of course, we've done it for so long, and we've thrived at it,\" Conley said. \"That's our identity. For us to change it in the middle of the season, you know, it was tough. But I think every single guy -- guys that are starting now, and guys who are coming off the bench -- all of them were the most professional we can [be]. We've got a veteran team. Guys weren't hanging their heads, complaining about the situation. They said this is what we're doing now, we've got to learn how to do it. Zach, Tony, Matt, everybody who's adjusted to it, they've done a great job.\"\n\nThe moves were made as the Grizzlies' defense continued a season-long drift downward with Randolph and Allen on the floor. Per NBA.com, Memphis' defensive rating before the lineup change Dec. 13 was 104.7 points per 100 possessions, tied with Milwaukee for fifth-worst in the league.\n\nI'll accept the role. I'm a professional. It ain't about me; it's about my teammates and the organization. So I'm going to go out and work hard and whatever they call up on me, I'm gonna be ready. \u2013 Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph\n\nAmong the 70 lineups around the league that have played 75 minutes or more together this season, the Grizzlies' previous starting five of Conley, Allen, Green, Randolph and Gasol was fifth-worst at 113.9 points allowed per 100 possessions. And when the Grizzlies replaced Allen with Lee, their defensive rating fell to 117.1 points per 100 -- the worst of all 70 lineups.\n\nAllen and Randolph are saying the right things.\n\n\"I'm getting used to it,\" Randolph said. \"I'll accept the role. I'm a professional. It ain't about me; it's about my teammates and the organization. So I'm going to go out and work hard and whatever they call up on me, I'm gonna be ready.\"\n\nSaid Allen: \"When I chose to re-sign here, one of the things I told the organization [was] that I'm all in. I turned down money to go to Milwaukee, to stay. So I told them that I'm all in. I'm gonna do what's best for the team...the league already knows who I am -- first team All-Defense. That's a stat, me taking pride in who I am. So what's best for the team. The league is changing. We want to go up-tempo, speed, and that was the way that we're trying to chase. But me saying all those things prior, I can't be too frustrated about it. I've just got to flow with the move.\"\n\nPlayers are creatures of habit, needing to stick with their game-day routines. For starters, who know their minutes will be consistent, it's easier -- rest, eat, arrive, warm up, play. But when you're not quite as sure when you're coming into a game, it can be harder to accurately gauge when to get into that pregame lather. Do you go hard in the layup line, or easy? How do you warm up older muscles that may have to sit for 15 or 20 minutes of real time before being put into a game?\n\n\"We all go through it,\" Carter said. \"You play long enough, all of us have gone through it.\"\n\nIn case some of you young heads have already forgotten, Vince Lamar Carter went to nine straight All-Star Games back in the day. LeBron might rep Northeast Ohio, and Steph might have the Bay locked down. Carter was The Man for an entire nation when he was known as Air Canada and dunked on the world in Toronto. (Just watch. And. And.)\n\nEven after deals sent him from Toronto to the Nets, Orlando and Phoenix, Carter was a superstar who played superstar minutes for 15 years. Only after signing with Dallas in 2011 did he begin the transition to role player, coming off the bench.\n\nPostgame: Mike Conley Mike Conley talks about the Grizzlies win over the Wizards as Jeff Green drops in for a video bomb.\n\n\"It's just understanding how to be you within the flow,\" Carter said. \"That's the biggest adjustment. You're going to have slow starts. I just speak from experience. For me, when it happened, it was just the reality of it, first of all, and then it's the understanding of how to be you within the flow of the offense. Knowing how to kind of get started. When you're a starter, you can kind of ease your way in. When you're coming off the bench, you have to be ready to go. You have to put it all together.\"\n\nJoerger continues to point to the Grizzlies' roster construction as part of the reasoning as well for the lineup changes, and it's never a good thing when a coach talks about roster construction. With Brandan Wright out several more weeks following knee surgery earlier this month, the Grizzlies' only bigs on the roster at present are Gasol, Randolph and JaMychal Green. Joerger wants either Gasol or Randolph on the floor at all times. That also necessitated Randolph going to the bench.\n\n\"Coaching and management have to be on the same page,\" Joerger said. \"If that's the case, you can make roster changes and tweaks. The biggest thing about small ball is you have to have shooting. Everybody wants to play small, but if you don't have the shooting, it's not as effective.\"\n\nThat was also a major issue with the previous lineup. Before the change, the Grizzlies were 29th in the league in three-point percentage (.308); 28th in three-point attempts per game (17.4) and 29th in three-point makes per game (5.4).\n\nBut it's not like this snuck up on Memphis. The Grizzlies' main priority last summer was re-signing Gasol, of course, but they also knew they had to upgrade their perimeter production after finishing next to last in three-point attempts and makes last season, and 23rd in three-point percentage. Yet Memphis didn't bring in a big-time shooter in the summer; Barnes was a career 33.8 percent shooter behind the arc entering this season. The Grizz did pull the trigger on an early-season trade, though, bringing in Mario Chalmers from Miami for veteran point Beno Udrih. After being, at best, the fourth option during his days with the Heat, Chalmers has the green light in Memphis to come in off the bench firing.\n\nSo far, the new perimeter guys have shot the ball decently, even as the Grizzlies have struggled to remain above .500 in the standings.\n\nBarnes has been solid, shooting 47.3 percent (35 of 74) from the floor since going into the starting lineup, including 37 percent on threes. Both are higher than his career percentages. Jeff Green isn't taking a lot of threes -- just 21 in his first nine games as the stretch four -- but he's shooting almost 48 percent from the floor. And Lee, a free agent at season's end, is shooting 50 percent since the change.\n\nGameTime: Tamed Grizzlies Greg Anthony, Danny Granger, and Sekou Smith detail the struggles Memphis has had adapting to the small-ball trend that teams are implementing.\n\nConley is among the best in the league at creating shots off the dribble; Gasol is one of the top passing centers. So going from a dump-in and spot-up game to a screen and roll game featuring Conley and Gasol gets the team's two best offensive players doing more of what they do best. That will create open looks all over the floor.\n\n\"The floor is spaced a lot more,\" Lee said. \"For guys like me, it's just going to be coming off of pick and rolls and dribble handoffs and whatnot. I'm evaluating the floor and seeing if the floor's wide open, I can pull up or attack all the way to the basket. Especially for Mike and Marc, guys are going to get pick and rolled a majority of the time. Marc is going to have that pocket where he can roll, where he has the whole paint to himself, and Mike has the same spacing. Once you make the defense make those long rotations, that wasn't what we were getting early on. If we make them rotate like that, then guys are going to be open. We just have to knock down shots.\"\n\nLast season, Conley shot 39.5 percent on catch and shoot jumpers, about 21 percent of all the shots he took. But when he shot within the first six seconds of the shot clock\u2014which almost always means in transition -- he shot 55 percent. Playing fast is right up his alley. And things look much different in the halfcourt now than they have in recent years.\n\n\"Man, I love it, actually,\" Conley said. \"It's a lot more freedom, a lot more vision. I can see things a lot better. It's not so much clogged up. And it's going to take a matter of time. The conditioning, I think, is different for a lot of us. We're not used to running, sprinting to get a layup or an open three. We're used to sprinting back on defense, then walking the ball up the court. For us, it's just a matter of getting used to the conditioning, and the more we play it, the better I think we'll be.\"\n\nIt will also take time to get used to new sets, something difficult to do during the grinder of the regular season. \"I think since we made the change, we've probably practiced two times,\" Lee said. No team in the league ran better high-low sets than the Grizzlies did with Randolph and Gasol. But now, the ball will be in Conley's hands more than ever.\n\n\"It's more the style you see in the league now, and for a point guard, your eyes kind of light up,\" Conley said. \"The adjustment is playing in all these sets we were used to playing, the big high-lows, to having to learn to move the ball, not take the quick shot just because it's there, keep playing with pace, and then on the defense end, getting back and knowing that we can just match up to whoever gets it, just switch it, as opposed to always trying to run back to your man. There's things we're just starting to learn how to do, to get away with, and things we have to get better at.\"\n\nGasol is fine with the new lineup, as long as the ball moves the way it should. He was frustrated with it sticking in the Grizzlies' loss in Washington Wednesday.\n\n\"Defensively, you feel more confident, because you can match up better,\" Gasol said. \"Offensively, it's going to take time. Especially because we don't have as much practice as we would like to. So you're going through a process, and learning things on the fly throughout the games. So, it's not as easy. It's not what you want to do. You probably want to do this (in) training camp, but it isn't the way it played out. You have to go with the flow.\"\n\nArena Link: Jeff Green Jeff Green talks with the NBA TV guys about hard work after the Grizzlies defeat the Rockets on Wednesday night.\n\nEven in its current state, barely above .500, Memphis is still currently a solid six in the west. And there's a clear declination at present between the top eight teams and the conference's also-rans. The Grizzlies may have time to work out the kinks.\n\nBut they'll have to finish strong enough to keep Conley from looking around next summer in free agency. Conley's completing a five-year extension signed in 2010. (\"It seems like the last contract was seven or eight years ago,\" he said.) Kevin Durant and other '16 free agents have gotten almost all of the ink, but the line to come after Conley will be long and varied. He's yet to make an All-Star Game since being taken fourth overall in 2007, but he's made an impression around the league (that happened well before his heroic stint in the second round against the Warriors last spring) and will command a max deal.\n\nWhile Conley wants to get a lay of the free-agent land, he's still eager to hear the Grizzlies' blueprint for the future.\n\n\"I just need to know that they're committed to winning,\" he said. \"That's pretty much what I want. I want to be part of winners, no matter what. I've been a part of teams that had 20-win seasons, and those are not fun. We've turned something around here, and if Memphis is willing to continue to commit to that, to winning, winning championships, that's what I want to hear, and that's what I want to hear from any team.\"\n\nJoerger said Saturday that his team is still searching for its identity, which must be tough medicine for his veterans who have known, for years, not only how they were going to play, and who they were going to play with, but that they were good at it.\n\nBut, things change.\n\n\"I don't think too much about it,\" Gasol said. \"It was done. So you roll with the punches.\"\n\n... AND NOBODY ASKED YOU, EITHER\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. From Ryan Becker:\n\nCoaches can't coach All-Star games in consecutive seasons. Steve Kerr was the coach of the West last season, but if he's not back by the All-Star break, could Luke Walton get the nod since the Warriors (most likely) will have the #1 seed? Or would Coach Pop get the nod?\n\nYou're correct, Ryan. Coaches cannot be their conference's coach in the All-Star Game in consecutive seasons. But the rule only applies to coaches, not teams. Since Kerr's status for the rest of this season after his back surgeries is still up in the air, the league, I was told Sunday, has not yet made a determination of what would happen if the Warriors have the west's best record at the All-Star break. If it is determined that Kerr won't be back on the bench by then, it is at least possible, as of now, that Walton would be the west's coach. League spokesman Tim Frank told the AP: \"At this point, it is unclear when Coach Kerr will return to the sidelines. We are seven weeks away from All-Star so it feels premature to address that situation.\"\n\nMaking a Stand. From Zack Greenfield:\n\nWould you agree that the Knicks' biggest improvement this year has come on the defensive end and is it realistic to think this team can win 35-40 games?\n\nDefinitely defense, Zack, though a healthy Carmelo Anthony and a young Kristaps Porzingis have helped the Knicks become a more diversified bunch at that end. But the defensive jump has been startling, a product of improved personnel like Robin Lopez in the middle and Arron Afflalo at two guard, veterans who don't need help guarding opposing players (the most significant improvements, as I see them, are in bold):\n\nNew York Knicks Team Statistics (2015-16 through 12/25/15) Category 2015-16 (NBA rank) 2014-15 (NBA rank) Points Per Game 97.9 (23) 91.9 (30) Offensive Rating 103.9 (20) 99.0 (29) Effective FG % 47.5 (26) 47.0 (27) Free Throw Attempts 679 (13) 1,575 (29) Points Allowed Per Game 99.0 (7) 101.4 (22) Defensive Rating 105.0 (16) 110.0 (28) Opponent EFG % 46.9 (4) 51.2 (29) Opponent Free Throw Attempts 764 (25) 2,032 (27) Opponent 3-Point % 30.2 (1) 38.0 (30) Defensive Rebounds 1,005 (10) 2,443 (29)\n\nI mean, going from last to first in opponent three-point shooting is a big deal.\n\nAs far as your 35-40 wins prediction, I'd probably bet on the low end. Maybe, if everything went right and they didn't have any significant injuries. But I think 30-35 wins may be more realistic. The road schedule this month is tough, and the Knicks still have another long west coast trip in March. And as my dude Sekou Smith pointed out, the Knicks were just 5-13 this season against teams with winning records before their game Sunday night against Boston.\n\nSend your questions, comments, criticisms and more irrefutable evidence that the Animal Revolution is nigh to daldridgetnt@gmail.com.

It is your right to yell/Tweet \"stick to sports\" and to believe this is part of another liberal conspiracy to take away people's guns. If only we could all get out of our defensive crouches on this issue, and not be held prisoner by absolutist positions, and find some common ground that would lead to some common-sense restrictions which would make it just a little harder -- a little -- for criminals, and terrorists, and the mentally ill to get weapons of mass destruction with little or no pushback. If only that modest goal was something we could all support -- those who live in a culture of safe and responsible gun ownership, and want to continue passing along that culture to their children, and those who want nothing to do with guns. Is that too much for a great nation? We really can't find any area on which to agree on trying to limit the damage that has been inflicted on so many families? Democrats, Republicans, independents, the God fearing and the Godless -- everyone is getting shot. It needs to stop. Kudos to the NBA and its players for at least trying to do something about it.\n\n2) Congrats to Dirk Nowitzki, now sixth on the NBA's all-time scoring list after passing Shaquille O'Neal. The Diggler is a great, great, great player, and he's still rolling.\n\n3) Whatever you think of The Process, Sam Hinkie, Brett Brown or anyone else, the 76ers' players needed a moment in the sun, and got one Saturday in the Valley of the Sun.

As Jackson said, when Michael Jordan was in his prime, you didn't see highlights of Jordan's footwork in the post, or his hustle getting back on defense. People didn't marvel at his basketball IQ. They showed his dunks, endlessly, breathlessly, and said that was the essence of Jordan's greatness. And as with Jordan, fans -- and, kids -- that don't celebrate the years of work Curry has put into becoming a better ballhandler, a better passer, into getting stronger, into developing his left hand, aren't seeing the forest for the trees. \"We don't fall in love with the things that made them great,\" Jackson said. \"We fall in love with the things that they do great.\" And he is absolutely, 100 percent correct.\n\n3) This is what I've been afraid of at Oracle. The intersection of want and need -- wanting to keep the existing East Bay fan base, but needing to raise enough capital to help offset the costs of the $1 billion venue the Warriors' owners are building in San Francisco -- often produces these results, where an arena is no longer filled with a team's true fans, but with more of those who think of a winning team the same way they do the hot new restaurant or club -- a place to be seen, and sampled, until the next new hot place comes along. Those are not the people who've given of themselves emotionally for decades, sharing the common bonding experience of rooting for a team that was so, so awful for so long.\n\n4) I have no way of knowing the veracity of the Al Jazeera report that claims Human Growth Hormone use by Peyton Manning and other pro athletes.

The NFL rulebook is stuffed full of complex instructions, random exceptions and obscure scenarios. Simplifying the document, a hot topic of late, has been a matter of public discussion for some time.\n\nIn the absence of movement there, however, the NFL has gone on the offensive this year to explain its rules to the general populace. The effort has gone far beyond its longstanding practice of putting its vice president of officiating on the NFL Network to explain controversial calls and it has reflected a deeply-held league view that much of the criticism directed at officials is generated by confusion and misinterpretation rather than competence.\n\nCurrent vice president of officiating Dean Blandino has begun appearing on some of the game-day videos the NFL produces to explain replay decisions. He also has called in to national broadcasts to provide background on decisions during games and tweets about particularly confusing or highly controversial plays.\n\nThe league, in addition, is producing a digital \"Video Rulebook\" on its operations website that explains what certain penalties look like. Fans can test their knowledge through a separate \"You Make the Call\" video series.\n\nIt shouldn't take that much work to educate fans on rules of a game, but it might be a more efficient approach than awaiting the uncertain results of any initiative to pare down the rules themselves. In the past two weeks alone, in fact, we've received multiple reminders about the obscure corners of the rulebook. Let's take a look at three of them.\n\nIllegal substitution Sunday in Philadelphia\n\nSituation: Fourth down from the Washington Redskins' 10-yard line, 12:10 remaining in the second quarter.\n\nPlay: Redskins' Tress Way punts 48 yards to Eagles' Kenjon Barner.\n\nPenalty: Illegal substitution on the Eagles.\n\nAnalysis: When you watch the play, you see Barner field the punt near the Eagles' sideline with fellow returner Darren Sproles positioned close to the far sideline. After the teams returned from a timeout, referee Walt Coleman announced the penalty on Barner because he \"came in at the last minute and did not get inside the numbers.\"\n\nColeman's explanation added to the confusion. Astute rulebook technicians know that an offensive player must advance beyond the painted numbers on the field to be considered a legal substitute, but defensive players -- and Barner was one because he was on the punt return team -- do not.\n\nThe rule itself is designed to prevent offenses from faking substitutions in order to confuse defenses attempting to match up. It doesn't want to penalize defensive players who run on the field but are ultimately called back.\n\nThe Eagles' return appeared designed to capitalize on that loophole, leaving the Redskins' coverage unit unaware that Barner would be in place to field the kick. But it appeared the Eagles got too cute.\n\nIt's not visible on the television broadcast, but based on Blandino's in-game tweet, Barner ran onto the field after the Redskins snapped the ball. That's prohibited by NFL Rule 5, Section 2, Article 4.\n\nColeman got the call right, if for the wrong reason. In the end, we learned that the painted numbers are important for offensive substitutions but not for the defense. File it away.\n\nSubtle coin-toss rules were brought to the forefront prior to overtime on Sunday. AP Photo/Peter Morgan\n\nCoin toss at MetLife Stadium\n\nSituation: Overtime coin toss between captains.\n\nPlay: New England Patriots captain Matthew Slater called heads, won the toss and asked to \"kick off, that way.\"\n\nPenalty: None, but referee Clete Blakeman granted the \"kick off\" part but not the \"that way\" part.\n\nAnalysis: Most of the attention on this play focused on whether coach Bill Belichick made the right decision to kick off in what turned out to be sudden death overtime (probably not, based on the numbers) or whether Slater erred in his request (complicated). But it also illuminated how precise an operation the coin toss, with its inherent options, really is.\n\nAs illuminated by Rule 4, Section 2, Article 3, the winner of the coin toss is allowed three options at the start of a game. He can defer, allowing the loser to pick first. He can choose whether to kick off or receive the kick. Or he can choose which goal to defend. The latter two options are available in overtime.\n\nThe captain can only choose from one of the option buckets, which is where Sunday's confusion started. The rulebook requires the referee to grant the captain's \"first choice\" and make clear that the decision is \"final and not subject to change.\"\n\nSo if a captain's priority is to defend a certain goal -- to ensure it has the wind, for example -- then he must explicitly state it. The rulebook considers that a separate option from kicking off. If he says he wants to kick off, he is in essence giving his opponent the option to choose the wind.\n\nWho knew a coin toss required such precision?\n\nIllegal grounding on an interception in Week 15\n\nSituation: Second down from the 50-yard line with 8:42 remaining in the first quarter between the Dallas Cowboys and New York Jets.\n\nPlay: Cowboys quarterback Matt Cassel threw an interception to Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis.\n\nPenalty: Cassel was called for intentional grounding on the play, which the Jets declined.\n\nAnalysis: We naturally think of intentional grounding as a play when the quarterback wildly throws the ball to a big patch of green turf (from inside the pocket, of course) to avoid a sack.\n\nIn this case, however, Cassel didn't get enough on the throw and Revis intercepted it near the sideline. There were no Cowboys receivers in the area, and Cassel was still in the pocket, so referee Craig Wrolstad had no choice but to throw the penalty flag.\n\nHere's another twist: Quarterbacks can also be called for intentional grounding on a completion to an ineligible receiver. That happened Sunday to Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel, who flipped a pass to offensive lineman Mitchell Schwartz while under duress in the fourth quarter of a 17-13 loss.\n\nReferee Walt Anderson could be heard on his microphone saying, \"All right, hold on\" before convening a conference of his crew. Ultimately, Anderson penalized the Browns for illegal touching (Schwartz was an ineligible receiver) and intentional grounding, because the ball never got past the line of scrimmage in the direction of an eligible receiver.", "Having practice facility is key in bid for Las Vegas NHL team": "The great thing about the expansion debate is that it is a story with so many subplots. How will an expansion draft work? Where would an expansion team or teams draft in the order? If there are two teams, are they staggered in their appearance?\n\nAnd for the two prospective ownership groups, the planning never really stops, even though they are in some ways operating in a vacuum.\n\nThat\u2019s why it was interesting to hear from Bill Foley, the man behind the Las Vegas bid, describe the search for potential locations for his team's practice facility. While the team would play out of the new Las Vegas Arena, which is scheduled for completion in spring 2016, Foley understands the need for a state-of-the-art practice facility for his squad, one that would also serve what he hopes will be a burgeoning youth and adult hockey community.\n\n\"We have four locations we are currently exploring for a practice facility, which would include two sheets of ice, fitness and medical for the team, locker rooms etc.,\" the financier and wine mogul said in a recent series of emails.\n\n\"We are also planning public locker rooms for league and youth hockey. The team offices for the coaches, etc., would also be there, video, etc.\"\n\nThe facility would range between 100,000 and 135,000 square feet, with 600 to 700 seats on one sheet for spectators, and a smaller set of stands on the second, which is similar in structure to practice facilities dedicated to other NHL teams, including the Pittsburgh Penguins' stellar new facility in Cranberry, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn terms of locations, Foley said they are looking at property in Henderson and three in the Summerlin area. Public financing might be involved with one or more of the sites, but the loan would be repaid with private funds, Foley added.\n\n\"So, no burden on the community,\" he said.\n\nFoley isn\u2019t assuming he's getting a team, but he\u2019s also cognizant that if he is awarded a franchise, the clock will tick quickly on many fronts, and having a place for the team to call home away from the Las Vegas Arena is a key piece of the expansion puzzle. It\u2019s also an important part of the grass-roots blueprint that will be so vital to the team\u2019s long-term success.\n\n\"Nothing would start until a team is awarded, but we want to be ready,\" he said.\n\nAs for support for a team, there are about 13,500 season-ticket commitments, and just one bunker suite left unsold.\n\nNow it\u2019s just a question of whether the league decides it wants to move there.", "More beer mile drama is on tap in Austin": "The Beer Mile World Classic in San Francisco featured the greatest field the sport has ever gathered. Four beers and one mile later, Canadian Lewis Kent emerged as the champion. ESPN's Greg Garber reports. (2:41)\n\nEvery nuanced, excruciating moment in the wonderful world of the beer mile is right there to see in online video.\n\nAnd so, after Corey Gallagher broke the world record in October with a sizzling 4 minutes, 54.4 seconds, fellow Canadian Lewis Kent broke down the splits necessary to regain it with a marker right on his refrigerator.\n\nThen the 21-year-old student at the University of Western Ontario went out on Nov. 17 and did it, almost to the second: 69, 74, 76, 73 = 4:51.9.\n\n\"Honestly,\" said Kent, who quaffed Amsterdam Blonde, \"I wasn't that surprised.\"\n\nNeither was Gallagher, who held the record (set with Bud Light Platinum) for a little over five weeks.\n\n\"He's not a serious, serious runner,\" said Gallagher, a Manitoba postman, not unkindly. \"But he's starting to grasp the little tricks you need to go fast.

I think the record's going to fall.\"\n\nThe next level\n\nPatrick Butler was enjoying a fancy dinner in Manhattan with his fianc\u00e9, Christina, when Kent texted him 30 minutes after he posted the most recent record-breaking video.\n\n\"Is it official?\" Kent asked the proprietor of www.beermile.com.\n\nLewis Kent had a prominent reminder of what it would take for him to break the beer mile world record. Courtesy Lewis Kent\n\n\"Politically, I was not in a great position,\" Butler said. \"But I snuck away, verified the video on my phone and posted it on Facebook. It was about 3 a.m. that same night when I got it up on the website.\n\n\"Just when you think the beer mile has crested, the record falls again. I think it became next-level for me when my mom forwarded me a link. There was a story on \"Ellen.\" When sponsors start to get involved, we're in a new place.\"\n\nIndeed, Kent -- a decent college cross country runner -- is a paid spokesman for Brooks, the running shoe and apparel company. Yes, he's being compensated nicely to drink a 12-ounce beer (at least 5 percent alcohol), run a quarter mile, then repeat the process three more times.\n\n\"I don't know the exact amount, but I'm sure it's great for a college kid,\" said Butler, who ran cross country at Wesleyan University. \"One of of the big winners is Brooks; I can see in this single blast of media they probably made their money back.\n\n\"It's kind of genius on their part to embrace this. Beers companies are still off limits -- they don't want to be seen as encouraging binge-drinking. But I can see other possibilities down the road.\"\n\nActually, it's Gallagher who was the first sponsored beer miler. Under Armour paid him to wear their gear a year ago in Austin.\n\nA few more seconds?\n\nGallagher is the defending Flotrack champion. He ran five minutes flat last December on the sprawling Formula 1 track outside Austin. It remains the fastest beer mile time recorded in an actual sanctioned race.\n\nMemorably, Gallagher's post-race rant about the legitimacy of James \"The Beast\" Nielsen's then-world record caused a stir on social media. When Nielsen invited Gallagher to his Beer Mile Classic in San Francisco back in August, Gallagher declined. Naturally, Nielsen won't be on hand next Tuesday.\n\nThis time around, the 28-year-old Gallagher is stirring things up again. A week before he broke Kent's record on Oct. 10 at the University of Manitoba, Gallagher claims he ran a 4:52.\n\n\"The video wasn't good, so I waited and ran it again a week later,\" Gallagher said. \"I had to ease back -- it was almost too fast.\"\n\nKent says a friend told him about that alleged 4:52.\n\n\"Whether it's true or not isn't relevant,\" he said, laughing. \"We'll find out who's faster in Texas.\"\n\nGallagher said he's saving himself for Austin, where the incentive for a world record is $2,500.\n\n\"I feel like there's a little bit in the tank,\" Gallagher said. \"Hopefully, it will translate. I know I have a few more seconds in me, for sure.\"\n\nNarrowing window\n\nEditor's Picks Beer mile record-setter Kent signs shoe deal Lewis Kent, who set the record for the beer mile on Tuesday, has signed an endorsement deal with running brand Brooks.\n\nBeer Mile World Classic delivers excitement The inaugural World Beer Mile Classic didn't produce a world record, but the best beer milers in the world put on a good show that included a dramatic ending to the team competition. 1 Related\n\nThis year, Nielsen has seen the record he set in April 2014 broken four times, by three different men. The 35-year-old says he's okay with this.\n\n\"I'm actually surprised that my world record lasted as long as it did,\" he said from his California home. \"There was an incredible amount of publicity that came from breaking five minutes. Those back-to-back records by the Canadian guys -- that's great.\n\n\"It's definitely got me excited to get the record back. I better hurry up and do it. I'm getting a little older, and these guys are in their running prime.\"\n\nNielsen, who set his record in the vacuum of an empty track at a local community college, did not fare well in his home race this summer. He would have finished sixth -- if he hadn't been disqualified for having too much beer left in his cans.\n\nAt the same race, former world-record holder Josh Harris also met with misfortune, spewing the contents of his stomach and being assessed the mandatory penalty lap.\n\nIt raised a question about the effect of a competitive field on beer milers. Does it enhance performance, or does the presence of opponents and a roaring crowd make it more difficult for athletes to chug and run?\n\nThe definitive answer could come Tuesday. The course is being set up in downtown Austin, in a parking lot at the American-Statesman newspaper.\n\n\"It's a really cool venue,\" said FloSport's Crutchfield. \"We're planning on a big crowd, hoping for 5,000. We'll have three of the top five men in the world and six of the top 10.\"\n\nOn the women's side, it will be two of the top three, with former world-record holder Chris Kimbrough, a mother of six from Austin, and 2014's second-place finisher, Andrea Fisher. Both women have run 6:28, just 11 seconds off the world record set a year ago by Beth Herndon.\n\nAdmission to the event is free, and spectators are encouraged to run in the preliminary heats. The elite races are scheduled to begin at 8:30 p.m. local time, with the men set to go off at 8:55.\n\nHow will it go?\n\nSome predictions:\n\nButler: \"I'm not sure we'll see a world record. It's the same reason you rarely see a world record at the Olympics. The guys are going to be in a headspace where they're more concerned about winning than their time. Still, the talent will be there. If the conditions present themselves, it's possible.\"\n\nNielsen: \"Lewis is coming off his cross country season. He'll be in better shape to break the world record. But will the course be up to it? Ultimately, the media wants to see a world record, but I guarantee the athletes want the win. I think you'll see a cat and mouse game, elbow to elbow. No one wants to rabbit a world record and get out-kicked at the end. \"\n\nKent: \"There's a chance you'll see a record. I'm really looking forward to it.\"\n\nGallagher: \"I think it will come down to one of us two. It will depend on the setup they have in that parking lot and the conditions. If feel I have a shot [at the record], I'm going to go for it.\"", "NHL 3 stars of the week: Johnny Gaudreau, Antti Niemi, Tyler Bozak": "Flames LW Johnny Gaudreau speaks with Bruce LeVine about how this season is easier than his rookie season, how Calgary turned its season around, how he has excelled despite his small stature and the new overtime rule.

He opened the week with his third career hat trick \u2013 and second of the month (also Dec. 4 vs. BOS: 3-1\u20144) \u2013 in a 4-1 triumph over the Winnipeg Jets Dec. 22. Gaudreau then scored twice, including the game-winning goal, in a 5-3 comeback victory over the Edmonton Oilers Dec. 27. The 22-year-old Salem, N.J., native paces the Flames and shares sixth in the NHL in both goals (17) and points (39) in 35 appearances this season. His five game-winning goals are one shy of the League lead (Joe Pavelski: 6).\n\nSECOND STAR \u2013 ANTTI NIEMI, G, DALLAS STARS\n\nNiemi went 2-0-1 with a 1.02 goals-against average, .966 save percentage and one shutout to lift the Stars (27-7-3, 57 points) back into first place in the League standings. He turned aside 30 of 31 shots in relief of Kari Lehtonen in a 6-3 win over the Minnesota Wild Dec. 21. Niemi then made 20 saves for his 35th career shutout (third this season) in a 4-0 victory over his former team, the Chicago Blackhawks, Dec. 22. He closed the week with 35 saves, plus another four in the shootout, in a 3-2 loss to the St. Louis Blues Dec. 26. The 32-year-old Vantaa, Finland, native boasts a 15-5-3 record (2.28 GAA, .917 SV%, 3 SO) in 24 outings this season, his first with the Stars.\n\nTHIRD STAR \u2013 TYLER BOZAK, C, TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS\n\nBozak ranked second in the NHL in both goals (4) and points (tied-5) to power the Maple Leafs (13-14-7, 33 points) to two victories in three starts. He recorded his second career hat trick, including the game-winning goal, in a 7-4 triumph over the Colorado Avalanche Dec. 21. Bozak then collected one assist in a 3-2 loss to the Arizona Coyotes Dec. 22 before closing the week with one goal in a 3-1 win over the New York Islanders Dec. 27.

The IAAF is scheduled to decide Friday whether to suspend Russia, a move which could keep Russian athletes out of next year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nFormer IAAF president Lamine Diack, who served as a full IOC member for 15 years until 2014, had his honorary membership suspended as he's under investigation on charges of corruption and money-laundering.

And, damn, he was always there. I tried to drop him on the first lap, the second, the third. That's why the race was so fast. I was only concerned about getting the win today, but Corey gets a lot of credit for pushing me.\"\n\nBecause of extenuating circumstances, it was an even more impressive run before an estimated 2,000 spectators than might have appeared.\n\nEditor's Picks Beer mile record-setter Kent signs shoe deal Lewis Kent, who set the record for the beer mile on Tuesday, has signed an endorsement deal with running brand Brooks.\n\nKent taped a segment on \"Ellen\" Monday featuring a truncated beer mile -- three beers over 300 meters in 90 seconds -- against a show staffer, which ran Tuesday.

I didn't think there was any chance for a record. I don't know how it happened, but it happened.\"\n\nKent pockets $5,000 for winning the race and setting the record, plus he gets an undisclosed bonus from Brooks, his new sponsor.\n\nGallagher, meanwhile, struggled at the start.\n\n\"After that first beer,\" he said, \"I was completely thrown off. I have no excuses.\"\n\nO'Mara, wearing an orange singlet and white tube socks, won the race in the chugging zone, quaffing her Budweiser Platinum with authority. Forty-three-year-old Austin resident Andrea Fisher, the 2014 second-place finisher, was credited with a second-place time of 6:26:29.\n\nLess than an hour after the race, O'Mara told ESPN.com she was feeling \"drunk but mostly happy.\"\n\n\"My gosh, this atmosphere was so much more competitive than Michigan,\" she said. \"I've picked up a lot of little tips, like walking through the transition area, that really helped me.\"\n\nElizabeth Herndon, a Kent State Geology professor who ran a 6:17.76 at last year's inaugural race, did not compete.\n\nO'Mara's previous best was a 6:40 run in the Michigan Beer Mile.

The Mets finished 18 games over .500 on the season, but only because they were 18 games over .500 against teams in the NL East. Against everyone else, they had a .500 record.\n\nWill things be different in 2016? It's again shaping up as a two-team race unless the Marlins ... oh, never mind. It's probably a two-team race.\n\nNew York Mets\n\n2015: 90-72, plus-70 run differential, lost World Series\n\n2016 projected record from FanGraphs: 89-73\n\n2015 payroll: $109.8 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $103.6 million\n\nThe biggest reason for optimism and a repeat trip to the World Series is, of course, the starting rotation. Not that anybody thinks 2015 was a fluke, but the rotation was remarkably consistent:\n\nFirst half: .249/.292/.384, 3.42 ERA\n\nSecond half: .246/.289/.382, 3.47 ERA\n\nThe scary thought for the rest of the NL East: The rotation could get even better. You know how good these guys are, and the 2016 edition could include a full season from Steven Matz and the possible return of Zack Wheeler to back up the trinity of Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard (choose your order). Everyone's favorite, Bartolo Colon, is also back.\n\nCould anything go wrong? Sure. While Wheeler went down in spring training with Tommy John surgery, after Syndergaard was promoted, all five starters remained healthy. Four guys started at least 29 games, and Harvey missed a couple of starts only because of his innings limit. In some fashion, it's likely that the only thing that can bring down the Mets is injuries to the rotation.\n\nThen again, teams with excellent run prevention have missed the playoffs before. The Indians allowed the second-fewest runs in the AL in 2015 and did not reach the postseason. The Royals allowed the fewest runs in the AL in 2013, fewer than they did in 2014 and 2015, but missed the playoffs. The Mariners allowed the fewest runs in 2014 and 2009 with nothing to show for it.\n\nSo the Mets will have to score runs. They were seventh in the NL in runs in 2015, but in August and September they had the second-best offense in the majors, behind only the Blue Jays. It wasn't just Yoenis Cespedes. Travis d'Arnaud returned from the DL and had an .820 OPS the second half; Michael Conforto came up from the minors and hit; Curtis Granderson had an .885 OPS the final two months; and even David Wright posted a .381 OBP after his return.\n\nThe 2016 team has added Neil Walker and signed Asdrubal Cabrera. This gives the Mets necessary depth in the infield in case Wright's balky back acts up. Still, the clearest path to the playoffs includes a healthy season from Wright and Wilmer Flores backing up at all three infield positions. The fans wanted a big free-agent outfielder. Mets ownership failed to oblige, instead signing Alejandro De Aza to platoon in center with Juan Lagares. Hey, at least it's not John Mayberry and Darrell Ceciliani.\n\nWashington Nationals\n\n2015: 83-79, plus-68 run differential\n\n2016 projected record from FanGraphs: 90-72\n\n2015 payroll: $169.2 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $137.6 million\n\n1. Have Bryce Harper do awesome things again. It would help if he did more of those awesome things against the Mets.\n\n2. Have Max Scherzer do awesome things again. Avoiding an August slump (0-3, 6.43 ERA) this time around would be beneficial.\n\n3. Stay healthy. Yes, fans across the country took great pleasure in all the \"experts\" being wrong about the preseason World Series favorites, but they did suffer a lot of injuries. Anthony Rendon played just 80 games; Denard Span, now a free agent, played 61; Jayson Werth played 88; and Ryan Zimmerman played 95. Stephen Strasburg missed some time, and Doug Fister, also a free agent, made just 15 starts. So yes, injuries did kill the Nats. They also have a roster of injury-prone players, so there's no guarantee this won't bite them again.\n\n4. Have a better bullpen. Jonathan Papelbon and Drew Storen are still here, but the Nats have also brought in Yusmeiro Petit, Oliver Perez and Shawn Kelley for better depth. FYI: The Nats had a 3.46 bullpen ERA, and the Mets had a 3.48. The Nats were 74-0 when leading after eight innings, but they lost eight games they were leading after seven.\n\n5. Let Trea Turner play. He's ready to take over from the departed Ian Desmond at shortstop, and he will provide more OBP, more speed and better defense. The Nats nearly acquired Brandon Phillips to play second base, which would have allowed Danny Espinosa to start at short with Turner getting more seasoning in the minors. But the job should be Turner's. The kid can play.\n\n6. Sign one more free agent. There's room in the budget. Maybe it's Howie Kendrick to play second base. Daniel Murphy, even with his defensive issues, could be a fit to give the Nats a needed left-handed bat. Or how about Cespedes? He could play center field and move Michael Taylor into a fourth-outfielder role, or he could play some left field to rest Werth and put Taylor's glove in the lineup.\n\nMiami Marlins\n\n2015: 71-91, minus-65 run differential\n\n2016 projected record from FanGraphs: 80-82\n\n2015 payroll: $63.1 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $55.2 million\n\nWe have to get a little imaginative to determine a playoff path for these next three teams, although it's certainly more plausible for the Marlins than the Braves or Phillies.\n\nSo ... 32 starts and 250 strikeouts from Jose Fernandez ... 150 games and 50 home runs from Giancarlo Stanton ... the 2014 version of Marcell Ozuna (4.5 WAR) instead of the 2015 version (0.4 WAR) ... Christian Yelich repeating his second half (.342/.392/.473) for a full season ... less Ichiro (sorry) ... a full season of dominance from Carter Capps (18 hits and 58 strikeouts in 31 innings!) ... Dee Gordon winning another batting title ... Justin Bour slugging .519 again versus right-handers but improving that .326 OBP ... and a rotation that has more than one starter making more than 21 starts.\n\nLet's stop there, because this is the key. Tom Koehler made 31 starts. No other starter made more than 21. Dan Haren was second on the team with 129 innings. You're not going to make the playoffs without a more settled rotation. So the Marlins have moved to improve their rotation, right?\n\nOf course they haven't. It's the Marlins. Instead, they've talked about trading Fernandez.\n\nAtlanta Braves\n\n2015: 67-95, minus-187 run differential\n\n2016 projected record from FanGraphs: 68-94\n\n2015 payroll: $107.5 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $84.2 million\n\nFanGraphs projects the Braves and Phillies as the two worst teams in the majors, as they were last season.\n\nCould a miracle happen? The young pitching on the Braves' 40-man roster doesn't impress me all that much. Julio Teheran regressed last year. Matt Wisler has a nice arm but hasn't figured out how to get out lefties (who hit .327/.416/.569 against him). Mike Foltynewicz throws 100 mph but not always over the plate. Manny Banuelos has also had control issues throughout his career. The Braves have an arsenal of young arms, but most of them will spend much of 2016 in the minors.\n\nOn the offensive side, the Braves will need monster seasons from Freddie Freeman and Hector Olivera just to improve on their majors-worst 573 runs. The Braves were last in home runs and next to last in doubles. Adonis Garcia and Cameron Maybin tied for second on the team after Freeman with 10 home runs. So ... umm, like I said, miracles can happen. The 1990 Braves went 65-97. The 1991 Braves went 94-68 and didn't stop losing for 15 years.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n\n2015: 63-99, minus-183 run differential\n\n2016 projected record from FanGraphs: 66-96\n\n2015 payroll: $145.6 million\n\n2016 projected payroll from Baseball-Reference: $101.1 million\n\nSo you're probably wondering how the Phillies have a $100 million payroll with a team that might lose 100 games? So am I. They're paying Ryan Howard $25 million in his final season. As part of the Cole Hamels trade, they picked up Matt Harrison's $13 million salary. They bought out Cliff Lee for $12.5 million. So that's half the payroll right there.\n\nAnyway, the Phillies aren't going anywhere in 2016. They brought in Jeremy Hellickson and Charlie Morton to headline the rotation alongside second-year right-hander Aaron Nola. Hellickson is coming off a 4.62 ERA with the Diamondbacks, and Morton is coming off a 4.81 ERA with the Pirates. And now they get to pitch in front of a worse defensive team! Yep, the Phillies were last in the majors with minus-92 defensive runs saved. They did sign Peter Bourjos, so he will at least help the outfield defense while contributing little with the bat.\n\nThere will be reasons to get excited about the Phillies, however: Maikel Franco's first full season; the possible arrival of shortstop J.P. Crawford; starter Vincent Velasquez, acquired in the Ken Giles trade, could be a big surprise; Nola; Jerad Eickhoff, part of the Hamels trade, looked good in his late-season call-up; and less David Buchanan and Sean O'Sullivan in the rotation.\n\nLet's say either the Mets or Nationals finish .500. Maybe the Pirates don't solve their rotation holes and win 83 games in that tough NL Central. Maybe the NL West teams all beat up on each other, and the division winner gets to only 86 wins. Then everything breaks right for the Phillies, and they win 87 games and a wild card. Everyone can dream!", "Week 16 fantasy winners and losers: Brandon Marshall's big day": "Winners\n\nBrandon Marshall, WR, New York Jets: Marshall's late-season run continued on Sunday against the Patriots, as he put up eight catches, 115 yards and two TDs. His 23 points marked the fourth time in the past five weeks that Marshall eclipsed the 18-point mark.\n\nDrew Brees, QB, New Orleans Saints: Brees entered this week with a heel injury, but he didn't let that stop him from lighting up the Jaguars for 412 passing yards and three touchdowns. It was Brees' seventh such performance of at least 400 passing yards and three scores, the most in the Super Bowl era. His 28 fantasy points tied for the most of any QB on Sunday.\n\nDeAngelo Williams, RB, Pittsburgh Steelers: With 153 total yards and two touchdowns, Williams was the lone fantasy bright spot for the Steelers on Sunday against the Ravens. Williams has now averaged 17.6 fantasy points per game after Pittsburgh's Week 11 bye.\n\nTim Hightower, RB, New Orleans Saints: Hightower has made the most of his opportunity with starter Mark Ingram out for the remainder of the season with an injury. On Sunday against the Jaguars, he gained 169 total yards on 30 touches. Thanks to two touchdowns, Hightower put up 28 fantasy points.\n\nBlake Bortles, QB, Jacksonville Jaguars: Bortles' hot streak predictably continued against the Saints' terrible pass defense on Sunday. For the sixth time this season, the QB threw for more than 300 yards. He added 4 TDs -- and a two-point conversion -- on his way to a 28-point performance.\n\nJulio Jones, WR, Atlanta Falcons: Jones' first matchup against Josh Norman this season netted the WR only eight points. But on Sunday, Jones got his revenge, scoring 23. His 70-yard touchdown in the second quarter marked his longest gain this season.\n\nDeAndre Hopkins, WR, Houston Texans: Hopkins torched Coty Sensabaugh and the Titans' secondary up and down the field, as the WR busted out of a mini-slump by his standards (14 points over the last two weeks) with a seven-catch, 117-yard, one-TD performance. He scored 17 points on the day, his highest total since Week 11 against the Jets.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick, QB, New York Jets: Fitzpatrick continued to display an impressive fantasy floor on Sunday against the Patriots. Throwing for 296 yards and three TDs -- including a game-winner in overtime to Eric Decker -- the QB has delivered down the stretch of the fantasy season (22.8 points per game since Week 12).\n\nAllen Robinson/Allen Hurns, WR, Jacksonville Jaguars: The Jaguars' dynamic WR duo took full advantage of a salivating matchup against the Saints, combining for 14 catches, 257 yards, 3 TDs and 43 fantasy points. Robinson torched much-maligned CB Brandon Browner for a 90-yard score, the longest pass play this season.\n\nFrank Gore, RB, Indianapolis Colts: If you were lucky enough to make it this far with Gore as one of your lead backs, he came up big in what is championship weekend for many leagues. Scoring 21 points behind 84 yards rushing and two TDs, Gore had his best fantasy outing of the season.\n\nBrandin Cooks, WR, New Orleans Saints: For the third time in four games, Cooks put up at least 100 receiving yards. The bulk of his production against the Jaguars came on a 71-yard touchdown, as Cooks scored 19 points on the day.\n\nJavorius Allen, RB, Baltimore Ravens: After scoring two total points over the past two weeks, Allen reasserted himself as the lead man in Baltimore's backfield, rushing for 79 yards and scoring a late touchdown on his way to the second-best fantasy outing of his season (16 points).\n\nLosers\n\nBen Roethlisberger, QB, Pittsburgh Steelers: Big Ben looked to have a premier matchup against a banged-up Ravens defense, but he compiled just four points on the day. How bad is that? It marks Roethlisberger's worst fantasy performance of the last five seasons.\n\nAaron Rodgers, QB, Green Bay Packers: Twenty-five other quarterbacks -- including Case Keenum, Ryan Mallett, Zach Mettenberger, Blaine Gabbert and, gasp, Brandon Weeden -- outscored Rodgers' seven fantasy points this week. Behind a struggling offensive line and receivers who rarely got separation vs. the Cardinals' stifling secondary, Rodgers posted his fourth-worst fantasy day since 2011.\n\nAntonio Brown, WR, Pittsburgh Steelers: A week after putting up 30 points, Brown scored just six as the Steelers suffered a costly loss to the Ravens. Brown had a 16-yard touchdown in the second quarter taken off the board after review, and it didn't get much better from there as Baltimore stifled the WR's big-play ability.\n\nTom Brady, QB, New England Patriots: With a first-round bye in hand and banged-up skill players, not many were expecting a vintage Brady day against a good Jets secondary. But the QB put up only 11 points on the day, posting his worst fantasy game of the season. It was the first time since Week 11 -- and just the second time all year -- that Brady didn't throw multiple touchdowns in a game.\n\nCam Newton, QB, Carolina Panthers: Newton's run had to end at some point, but for owners playing in their fantasy championships, the timing could not have been worse. After averaging more than 28 points per game over his last seven contests, Newton could only muster 13 against the Falcons. Ten of those came via the ground game, as the QB was held to his second-lowest passing total of the season (142).\n\nDoug Martin, RB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: It's rare to find a running back who scores a touchdown on this portion of the list, but Martin earned his spot with two fumbles against the Bears. The RB couldn't find many open running lanes against Chicago, gaining just 49 yards on 17 carries and posting his lowest point total (six) since Week 9.\n\nTed Ginn Jr., WR Carolina Panthers: Ginn entered Week 16 as one of the hottest fantasy receivers in the game, scoring six touchdowns and 64 total fantasy points over his last three games. On Sunday, though, he managed just one catch for 9 yards against the same Falcons team that he put up 120 yards and two TDs against in Week 14.\n\nChristine Michael, RB, Seattle Seahawks: After getting 16 carries last week, many believed Michael was the Seahawks' featured back of choice headed their Week 16 game against the Rams. But as Seattle faced a big deficit, any hopes of Michael putting together a breakout performance dissipated. He carried the ball just six times for six yards, and posted one fantasy point on Sunday.", "Who will get the NFC's No. 1 seed?": "Insider\n\nESPN's Louis Riddick and Cris Carter join Mike and Mike to share their thoughts on which NFL team has the most at stake going into the final week of the regular season. (1:51)\n\nWith a loss to Atlanta on Sunday, the Carolina Panthers lost their shot at a perfect 16-0 regular season. They lost an opportunity to clinch home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. And they even lost their place as this season's Super Bowl favorite according to the Football Outsiders playoff odds simulation.\n\nWe now have the Arizona Cardinals as the No. 1 most likely team to win the Super Bowl after their blowout victory against the struggling Green Bay Packers. The Cardinals moved up from seventh to third in our weighted DVOA ratings, while the Panthers dropped to fourth after their loss. Arizona now wins the Super Bowl in 20.9 percent of our simulations, with Carolina second at 18.1 percent.\n\nIs the difference between Arizona and Carolina enough to make up for the fact that the Panthers are still a heavy favorite to get the No. 1 seed in the NFC and thus home field in any prospective NFC Championship Game?

The probabilities are based on each team's current weighted DVOA rating as well as home-field advantage. (DVOA is Football Outsiders' proprietary defense-adjusted value over average metric that looks at a team's performance on every play and adjusts based on situation and opponent, explained further here. Weighted DVOA then takes that rating and adjusts it to lower the strength of games that took place more than a month ago.) Some ratings are adjusted before the simulation because of injuries, primarily to quarterbacks. Note that our odds will be different from playoff odds you might find elsewhere on ESPN.com (or at FiveThirtyEight.com) because each set of team ratings is computed differently.\n\nIt's important to remember that the playoff odds simulation is designed to look at a series of games rather than one-on-one matchups. The odds here don't take into account the specific strengths and weaknesses of teams facing each other in Week 17.\n\nFor our last regular weekly playoff odds report, we've also added a listing of each team's current odds of winning the Super Bowl. You can find the full playoff odds report, including the odds of each team winning each of the six seeds, on FootballOutsiders.com.\n\nCarson Palmer and the Cardinals still have a shot to get home field throughout the NFC playoffs. Rich Schultz/Getty Images\n\nAFC playoff projections\n\n1. New England Patriots\n\nCurrent record: 12-3 | Weighted DVOA: 21.6 percent (No. 7)\n\nClinched: First-round bye | Super Bowl odds: 15.9 percent\n\nIn the long run, the overtime decision and loss to the Jets has essentially no effect on the Patriots' odds of winning the Super Bowl. A Patriots win would have given them the No. 1 seed, which they still get in 77.8 percent of our Week 17 simulations. But it also would have given Pittsburgh an 88.5 percent chance to make the playoffs instead of the Jets. In that world, our simulation would have made the Patriots' odds of winning the Super Bowl 15.97 percent instead of the current odds of 15.92 percent. It's a minuscule difference.\n\nThe Patriots win this Sunday's game in Miami in 72.0 percent of simulations; the other 5.8 percent of simulations in which the Pats finish with the top seed represent the chance that both New England and Denver lose this week.", "Roger Federer, Madison Keys decisions reveal the slow end to the supercoach": "Just days apart last week, Roger Federer and Madison Keys cut loose their renowned coaches (respectively, Stefan Edberg and Lindsay Davenport) and hired more conventional mentors.\n\nIvan Ljubicic, who never played in a Grand Slam final, will replace Edberg as 34-year-old Federer's co-coach (with Severin Luthi) in 2016. Former ATP journeyman Jesse Levin, who had a career-high ranking of No. 69, will mentor the 20-year-old Keys.\n\nIs the \"supercoach\" an endangered species?\n\nAfter two years, Roger Federer, right, and Stefan Edberg parted ways, raising questions as to the value of a \"supercoach.\" Aurelien Meunier/Getty Images\n\nNeither Federer nor Keys managed to win a major title while working with their most recent supercoach. Nor has Michael Chang's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Kei Nishikori. And who can forget Jimmy Connors one-match disaster as Maria Sharapova's coach, or that Martina Navratilova lasted just a few weeks as Agnieszka Radwanska's mentor early this year?\n\nIt makes you wonder. Has the much-hyped trend of elite players striking up partnerships with celebrated former champions run its course?\n\nIn fact, has it even been as successful as we expected?\n\nLet's review. Connors and Andy Roddick set up an unexpected and novel partnership in 2006 and enjoyed a fruitful 19-month relationship. But Roddick never did win that elusive second major under Connors' guidance. It seemed just a one-off pairing, but the \"supercoach\" theme re-emerged and caught fire when Ivan Lendl took charge of Andy Murray's career in December 2013.\n\nThe idea was compelling at first largely because of the human-interest angle. Both men had been dominated by their tennis-focused mothers. Could tough-guy Lendl, once a perennial Grand Slam bridesmaid just like Murray, transform mopey Andy into a champion?\n\nThe relationship lasted for two years, during which Murray punched through to win his first major (on his fifth try with Lendl) at the 2012 US Open and went on to win the Olympic gold just a month later. In 2013, Murray became the first British man to win Wimbledon in 75 years. Lendl and Murray split in March of 2014, and Murray hasn't won a major since.\n\nLendl and Murray did more than just establish the supercoach trend. They set a bar that only one other partnership has come even close to approaching. Boris Becker was brought on as top-ranked Novak Djokovic's co-coach in 2014. Becker was assigned the job of helping Djokovic navigate the most critical moments of his most crucial matches because his record in Grand Slam finals in 2012-13 was 2-4.\n\nSince then, with Becker in his guest box, Djokovic is 4-2 in major finals. The first of the two losses was at the French Open of 2014, when Nadal was still at his \"King of Clay\" peak. The other loss was at this year's French Open, on a day when there was nothing Djokovic -- or anyone else -- could have done to stop Stan Wawrinka.\n\nAfter that, the drop-off in the success of supercoaches is abrupt. Loosey-Goosey Goran Ivanisevic did a terrific job of helping Marin Cilic overcome his tendency to get mired in analysis paralysis. But such makeovers are almost always temporary, like hypnosis. Cilic won the 2014 US Open, and that was a priceless contribution from Ivanisevic. But since then, Cilic has reverted to his former self. He's had some injury troubles, too. But once again, he's a big, quiet, dangerous but inconsistent guy.\n\nNishikori, runner-up to Cilic in that unusual 2014 US Open final, has a similar story. He added Chang to his coaching team in 2014 under the theory that some of Chang's storied grit and consistency would rub off. Some of it certainly did: Nishikori went from a top-20 player to one just outside the elite circle of Grand Slam champions. But Nishikori was a disappointment in majors this season, going just 9-4 and never reaching higher than his quarterfinal appearances at the Australian and French Opens.\n\nIt's always been difficult to figure out Federer's relationship with his coaches, because astute Federer may be his own best coach. Thus a \"supercoach\" like Edberg seems more like a sounding board or adviser.\n\nThe partnership undoubtedly brought an extra touch of class to the center courts of the world, as well as a greater emphasis on attacking tennis. But then, Paul Annacone (Federer's former coach) had advocated for a more aggressive game as well. In the end, though, Edberg was part of the team for 24 months during which Federer's main mission -- winning a major -- remained unfulfilled.\n\nThe latest split, between Keys and Davenport, is notable. The young player chose to cut loose a three-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1 -- even after Keys moved up to No. 18 in the rankings, 13 spots higher than she was in 2014.\n\nKeys claimed her decision was based on the fact that Davenport, a mother of four and a television commentator, was unable to travel as much as Keys wanted. \"It wasn't like we had some big blowout fight and we hate each other,\" Keys told a WTA publicist. \"That's not the case. Obviously, we want to still work with each other. She just has so much.\"\n\nStill, Davenport had \"so much\" this year, too, and things worked out pretty well. Perhaps Keys is just trying to back away from the pressure of high expectations, which are also a byproduct of hiring a supercoach. The antidote, for Keys: Hire Levine, a journeyman.\n\nIs this the start of a trend?", "2015 Holiday Gift Guide Gifts For Golfers": "\"Here comes Caddie Claus, here comes Caddie Claus, right down 18th Fairway Lane!\" This year the golf bag is full of cool and practical things you'll love to give or receive.

Banwarth, who is trying to make her first Olympic roster for the upcoming Rio Games, was clearly thrilled -- but not surprised -- to see such a huge turnout for the sport she loves.\n\nI caught up with her before the title matchup, and she got emotional talking about her beloved college team and her Rio dreams.\n\nespnW: What does it mean to you to see two sellout crowds here this weekend?\n\nBanwarth: As a Husker alumni, I'm really proud and I'm really grateful for the Nebraska community. The volleyball community is just amazing, they love volleyball in the state of Nebraska. To have the final four here with 18,000 fans is just amazing.\n\nespnW: What do you think makes Omaha such a great host city?\n\nBanwarth: I think it's the people here. Like I said, they just love volleyball. And obviously they're cheering for the Huskers tonight, but honestly, they just love and appreciate good volleyball. So when there are four good teams here, they come and support them no matter what. Even if Nebraska wasn't here this weekend, there still would be a ton of people here because they just love the sport that much.\n\nespnW: What does that kind of support and the record crowd say for the sport and its future?\n\nBanwarth: I think it's amazing and really shows that the sport of volleyball is growing in this country. And that's really the goal for USA Volleyball. I think Nebraska volleyball is playing a huge, huge role in that.\n\nespnW: As a Nebraska alum, what does it mean to be back here cheering on your former team?\n\nBanwarth: I am super proud, and it brings back a ton of great memories from my college career and the final four I played here. I'm happy, and I know it's such an amazing experience they're going through right now. I'm proud, I'm happy and I'm just thrilled to be here tonight and hope they can get it done.\n\nespnW: What stands out to you most about your days as a Husker?\n\nBanwarth: The fans, again, are just so amazing. When I played in the final four [in 2008] here in Omaha, we set a record -- well, it was a record until a few days ago -- with over 17,000 people in attendance cheering us on. It was just so loud, and it was such a great match with us and Penn State; it really just topped off a great experience.\n\nespnW: What is it like being part of USA Volleyball now?\n\nBanwarth: It's exciting. It's nerve-racking, and it's one of the happiest times of my life, because I'm pursuing my goals and doing what I love at the same time. The [Olympic] qualifiers are creeping up on us and it's go time. It's getting down to the wire a little bit, so I'm anxious and excited about it, but I'm confident we're ready for it.\n\nespnW: What would it mean to you to be representing the U.S. in Rio?\n\nBanwarth: Gosh, that would be amazing. For the past five years now, I've dedicated my life to that. I'm getting really emotional talking about this. If it were to work out for me, it would just mean everything to me.\n\nespnW: Does not making the team in 2012 give you extra motivation for making the 2016 roster?\n\nBanwarth: Yes, definitely. I remember watching the Olympics in 2012 from my couch in Iowa, and it was almost surreal because I had trained with all of them. To see them play at the Olympics and knowing I had played with them made it a little more real for me that maybe I could do it. I think watching that fueled the fire a little bit. It really remotivated me to work hard for the next four years.\n\nespnW: Do you think your team could win the gold?\n\nBanwarth: Yes, I think we're capable of winning gold. I mean, there are a lot of great teams in the world, so it would definitely be a challenge. We will have to battle and fight and scratch and claw for every single point if we're going to do it. But yes, I think we're definitely capable.", "Andy Murray greater than Fred Perry after Davis Cup triumph with Great Britain": "Andy Murray would be the first knight of British tennis. Should he receive an invitation to the palace, he would surely also be the first Briton of any profession or walk of life to gain a knighthood as a result of adventures in a Belgian warehouse.\n\nBut there was another upgrade in status to consider after Murray propelled Great Britain to a first Davis Cup victory since Fred Perry's team defeated Australia on the Wimbledon grass in the summer of 1936.\n\nThe moment that Murray's backhand lob fizzed and looped over David Goffin's head to win the team competition -- those illegally low-hanging Belgian girders couldn't stop history -- was the time to stop thinking of the Scot as the greatest British player since Perry.\n\nMurray's status is a little higher than that: he is the greatest British tennis player of all time. So above Perry, above that mythical figure of British tennis, the one immortalised as a statue in the grounds of the All England Club, as the polo-shirt of choice for mods, and as the name that always seems to follow the words 'not since'.\n\nAndy Murray's 2013 Wimbledon triumph made him the first male champion on those courts since Fred Perry 77 years prior. Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nPerry, incidentally, was never knighted as the British tennis establishment -- and the establishment in general -- wasn't so fond of a man whose father had been a Labour MP.\n\nTennis today is so substantially different to what Perry played in the 1930s that it's helpful to regard them as two different sports, and to view the game that Murray plays as superior in every way. Perry's time wasn't nearly as competitive or as physically and mentally demanding as the world that Murray operates in.\n\nA personal view is that Murray's record of achievement -- one Olympic gold medal, a US Open title, one Wimbledon victory and now the Davis Cup -- is weighty enough to imagine that he now stands above Perry, who achieved the career Grand Slam by scoring all four majors at least once, as well as winning four Davis Cups.\n\nIn his day, Perry didn't have rivals such as Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic to contend with, all three of whom are universally regarded as being among the greatest players to have ever swung rackets.\n\nEven in this golden era of tennis, Murray has snaffled plenty that shines and glitters, with this Davis Cup now added to that collection. He is only the third man in history, after Andre Agassi and Nadal, to win the Olympic singles tournament and the Davis Cup. And now, like the other three members of the Fab Four of the modern generation, he has won this monster-trophy, some 105 kilograms of silver and wood.\n\n\"Murray has definitely nailed the title of the greatest British player of all time,\" Greg Rusedski wrote in his Telegraph column on Monday. \"Fred Perry was fantastic, but this era throws up some very different challenges.\"\n\nThis was the third time that Murray had been The First Since Fred, with his triumph at the 2012 U.S. Open making him the first British man to win a major singles trophy since Perry in 1936, and his 2013 Wimbledon success ending a 77-year wait for a British male Wimbledon champion.\n\nAnd Murray hasn't heard the last of what Perry accomplished in the 1930s. To do that, he would have to win the Australian Open, which no British man has achieved since Perry's 1934 success, and also become the first British winner at Roland Garros since Perry in 1935.\n\nThe party line is that this was a team effort -- but Andy Murray helped win 11 of Great Britain's 12 Davis Cup points. British Tennis via Getty Images\n\nOf course, the party line is that this was a team effort, and it's true that Murray didn't do this completely on his own. But he wasn't far off. The only point that he didn't contribute was James Ward's victory over John Isner in the first round against the United States in March. The other 11, Murray won either on his own or when playing doubles alongside his brother Jamie.\n\nBy beating Goffin, Murray became only the third man, after John McEnroe in 1982 and Mats Wilander in 1983, to win eight singles rubbers in a year. In addition, he was only the fourth player in history to score 11 or more victories in a year, following on from McEnroe in 1982, Michael Stich in 1993 and Ivan Ljubicic in 2005.\n\nMurray almost needed his own personal statistician on that bench in the Flanders Expo -- he was the first man to win three live rubbers in a final since Pete Sampras did so against Russia in 1995.\n\nConsider the help that Perry had in his time from Bunny Austin, a man good enough to have played in two Wimbledon singles finals. Perry never carried a team as Murray has done this year.\n\nAnd while Perry won this trophy four times, three of those were won in years when Britain, as the defending champions, had a bye straight into the final. This year, Murray's Britain had defeated all three of the other Grand Slam nations -- the United States, France and then Australia -- before arriving at the end of the tramline for this final against Belgium.\n\nSo Perry was a showman of the courts, and after winning matches would often jump the net to shake hands with his opponent. But Murray can top that; what could possibly be more dramatic than winning the Davis Cup with such a backhand?", "Kansas State Wildcats Bill Snyder's legacy in letters": "MANHATTAN, Kan. -- Bill Snyder has built an incredible winning legacy at Kansas State.\n\nFor that, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, becoming just the fourth active coach ever to be enshrined in the college hall.\n\nBut Snyder's legacy at Kansas State will go far beyond any accomplishment on the field.\n\nOver the years, he has touched hundreds upon thousands through his anachronistic tradition of writing letters by hand.\n\n\"Those letters are part of his legacy,\" said Kansas State grad Julie Horvath, whose family alone has received three letters from Snyder in the past year.\n\nSince his coaching career began as a high school assistant in the 1960s, Snyder has penned close to a dozen letters daily. As a result, his left-handed, diagonal calligraphy has become as recognizable as the wind-breaker jackets he dons on game day. And at 76 years old, he hasn't slowed down. In fact, he still writes so many letters that go through four purple felt pens a week, and a couple hundred a year.\n\n\"With all the responsibility he has, with a million things to do, he takes the time to make you feel like the most special person to him -- when he's doing the same for a thousand different people,\" said Wayne Goins, director of jazz studies at Kansas State. He has received five letters from Snyder over the years.\n\nSnyder's letter-writing gained notice recently, as opposing players have begun posting them on social media. TCU's Trevone Boykin posted such a letter from Snyder after he quarterbacked the Horned Frogs to a last-second win over the Wildcats.\n\nI have so much respect for Coach Snyder and his Kansas st football team! #LivingLegend pic.twitter.com/An0ANnJgME Trevone BoyKING (@OGcURIOUSDEUCE) October 16, 2015\n\n\"If a young man gets hurt, I want to let him know I'm thinking of him,\" Snyder said. \"If somebody does something that maybe others see as a reason they lost a ballgame, I'll respond to that, because no one loses a game. If somebody has a good performance, you certainly want to let them know you thought they did well.\"\n\nBut the letters like Boykin's are just a drop in the ocean.\n\nAnd to anyone who has received one of Snyder's letters, he will always be so much more.\n\nIt's always been important to me to respond to people. Anyone in my position is always going to receive an ungodly amount of correspondence on a daily basis. But I always felt it was important. Put yourself in the same position; you don't want to reach out to somebody and never get a response. -- Snyder\n\nJake Trotter/ESPN\n\nThrough his letters, Snyder made three major events for one family all the more special.\n\nThat began with Julie Horvath, who wanted to do something unique for her sister Alicia's wedding. She had heard rumors of Snyder responding to wedding invitations. So she passed along her sister's announcement. Sure enough, Snyder wrote back, congratulating the newlyweds with a note.\n\n\"They absolutely loved it,\" Julie said. \"It was the coolest thing.\"\n\nShortly after Alicia's wedding, Julie got engaged to Ryan Wallace, a writer for the K-State website, GoPowercat.com. Alicia secretly returned the favor, sending Julie's wedding announcement to Snyder, who once again wrote back.\n\nThis fall, the sisters teamed together. Their parents were celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary. So the daughters bought them tickets to K-State's season opener. And for the kicker, they wrote Snyder to see if he would surprise them with a note. Without fail, he did. And the daughters surprised their parents with the letter on the way to the game.\n\n\"My mom was so excited,\" Julie said. \"Her eyes welled up.\"\n\nWhen players, coaches or people -- students, student-athletes, professors -- do something significant, people that have some kind of association with our university, I want to recognize they've done something extremely well. -- Snyder\n\nAny time people want jazz in the Little Apple, they call Wayne Goins.\n\nJake Trotter/ESPN\n\n\"It's usually either my students or me playing,\" said Goins, who also plays guitar for a faculty jazz band.\n\nYears ago, Snyder saw Goins' band play. Snyder enjoyed the music so much, he went up to the stage between numbers to let the band know.\n\nDays later, Goins received a letter from Snyder telling him again.\n\nSnyder and Goins have since become friends. They cross paths at events. Snyder will go see Goins play around town. He has even had Goins' band play at fundraisers.\n\nThis year, Goins was awarded the title of \"University Distinguished Professor,\" the highest honor K-State gives professors.\n\nShortly after, Goins received another note from Snyder, who wanted to let Goins know he was proud.\n\n\"He stays on top of things,\" Goins said. \"Not only is he the nicest and most genuine man on the planet, he goes the extra mile to let you know he cares.\n\n\"That's what's amazing to me. ... That's what's so great about him.\"\n\nIf you communicate with someone, you'd like the response to be genuine. -- Snyder\n\nThis spring, fourth-grader Claire Gottschalk was given a poetry assignment: to ask someone to share a favorite poem and explain why it's meaningful. Most of Claire's classmates chose family members. But Claire, part of an avid K-State family, chose Snyder.\n\nShe didn't know if he'd answer. But she took the chance. Three weeks later, the reply came. Snyder did have a favorite poem, \"Grandpa,\" and he enclosed it with the letter.\n\nJake Trotter/ESPN\n\n\"When you read it, you may understand why it has been my favorite for a long time,\" Snyder wrote. \"My grandpa was a guiding light in my life.\"\n\nThe poem hit home for Claire. Her grandpa had died when she was young, but she had memories of going to the Kansas State Fair, which he had helped run for 25 years.\n\n\"The poem made me think of my grandpa,\" Claire said. \"It was really special.\"\n\nClaire received the class award for eliciting the \"coolest\" reply.\n\n\"The fact he can relate to anyone, doesn't matter if it's a 10-year old,\" said Claire's father, Joe.\n\n\"That shows what kind of person he is.\"\n\nThe personal touch of being able to write it down. I think that has meaning. -- Snyder\n\nThe Lannous had always bled green and gold. Ken was a Baylor athletic trainer. Their son Kenny had received his degree in Waco, Texas. But after Kenny got a job in K-State's athletic department, the Lannous had a second Big 12 school.\n\nJake Trotter/ESPN\n\nKen's wife Patti quickly became a hit at K-State, thanks to the chocolate pecan cookies she'd bring whenever visiting her son. Snyder loved them so much he wrote to tell her.\n\nBut last spring, the Lannous had a scare when Ken felt a sharp pain. After tests, doctors discovered a mass in his chest. They decided Ken needed open heart surgery to determine if the tumor was malignant and whether it had spread to his heart.\n\nThough the procedure was risky, surgeons successfully removed the mass. While recuperating, Ken received several get-well cards. But only two of them came handwritten. One was from a 90-year-old aunt. The other, from Snyder.\n\n\"It was like we were best friends,\" Ken said. \"That's really what made it special.\"\n\nKen has since made a full recovery. Recently, they welcomed a new grandchild through Kenny.\n\n\"I feel like we've been accepted at K-State, strictly because of the way Bill is,\" Ken said. \"Here's a guy in the College Football Hall of Fame, the entire nation knows him. There's no reason for him to take the time to write in that detail that he's thinking about you and praying for you.\n\n\"If I walked in a room, he probably wouldn't know me. And yet, I feel like I'm part of his family.\"\n\nIt's important to care about people. That's what's important in our program, portraying that. -- Snyder\n\nBrad Jackson was undergoing chemotherapy this summer to combat the softball-sized tumor on his liver. The bile-duct cancer had even forced him to go on disability.\n\nHe and his wife Kathy had anxiously been monitoring the mail for his first disability check when an unexpected letter arrived instead.\n\nTheir daughter Briana, a K-State grad, had heard about Snyder's letter-writing. So without telling her parents, she composed a letter to Snyder.\n\n\"I understand that my timing is very poor,\" she wrote. \"You have a football season to focus on. However, it would mean so much to my father to hear from his favorite college coach.\"\n\nThat day when the Jacksons went to the mailbox, they found the letter from Snyder.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it,\" Brad said. \"I was overwhelmed. For him to take the time to write me just meant the world to me. After I got that, I looked at my wife and said, 'This is way better than my disability check. This trumps it completely.' \"\n\nSaid Kathy\" \"Our family loves Bill Snyder. He lifted our spirits.\"\n\nThere isn't a day that goes by I don't get a letter saying how the 16 goals have had an impact in someone's life. -- Snyder\n\nAt just 25, Patrick Hines was on a dangerous path. He was 50 pounds overweight from gorging pizza and slamming cans of soda. His cholesterol was through the roof. He had no energy and couldn't sleep.\n\n\"I had no motivation,\" said Hines, a recent K-State grad.\n\nAfter one week in the gym, Hines was already about to quit. But in bed, he began reading a K-State poster on his wall, which included Snyder's famed 16 goals for success.\n\nHines suddenly felt motivated.\n\nHe committed to a salad diet. He only drank water. He dragged his body to the gym daily. And whenever he felt weakness, he would think about the poster, which espoused the qualities of \"commitment\" and \"self-discipline.\" In six months, Hines dropped 40 pounds. Never feeling better, he wrote Snyder.\n\n\"I wanted to thank him,\" Hines said, \"even if it was probably a long shot he'd read it.\"\n\nBut Hines soon heard back from Snyder, who encouraged him to \"keep up the great work.\"\n\n\"All the hard work, all the dieting, for Bill Snyder to acknowledge it, meant such a great deal,\" Hines said. \"Even to this day, it helps me keep going.\"\n\nJake Trotter/ESPN\n\nIt's not about tradition. It's about doing the right thing. -- Snyder\n\nKaiden Schroeder was in an all-too-familiar place. Diagnosed with leukemia at four, Kaiden was back at the hospital in Kansas City. He was drained emotionally from living in a hospital bed, and physically from the chemotherapy.\n\nBut this day would take a turn for the better when an unexpected letter from Snyder arrived. It was the first of several letters, posters and Skype videos to Kaiden.\n\n\"He was having a down time then,\" said Kaiden's father, Chris Schroeder. \"When he saw what it was, he just started smiling from ear-to-ear.\"\n\nKaiden's story is well known locally.\n\nHe was the boy who Snyder, former defensive end Ryan Mueller and the Wildcats invited to the 2013 spring game. There, they designed a play for him to score a touchdown.\n\n\"Had his own locker, with his own nameplate,\" Chris said. \"Seeing the whole sideline clear out to go to the end zone and carry him to the sideline -- it was just awesome.\"\n\nShortly before, Kaiden had undergone a bone marrow transplant. His younger sister, Ashlyn, then only 4, was the donor.\n\nThe fight against the leukemia hasn't come without setbacks. This summer, he required another bone marrow transplant; this time, Chris was the donor.\n\nBefore returning to the hospital, Kaiden packed up all the letters and memorabilia he'd received from Snyder and the players. He then placed them on the windowsill of his hospital room.\n\n\"They remind him of all the support he has,\" Chris said.\n\n\"Coach Snyder is a real gentleman. It's been a blessing, keeping our spirits up, keeping Kaiden's spirits up. The whole Wildcat family been phenomenal.\"\n\nThere's never something that comes across my desk that I don't respond to. -- Snyder\n\nRyan Archer didn't have any special reason to write Snyder, other than wanting to do something special for his daughter Riley's 12th birthday.\n\n\"We'd heard about Coach Snyder writing people,\" Archer said. \"Honestly, I really didn't think he'd respond.\"\n\nWell, he did.\n\nArcher saved the letter for Riley's birthday, which happened to be on the same day as K-State's spring game. On the way there, Archer surprised his daughter with the letter.\n\n\"We didn't have a cause. Nobody was sick,\" Archer said. \"So for him to take the time just to wish a 12-year-old happy birthday, meant a lot.\"\n\nThe most significant person in my life was my mother. So I have a great appreciation for mothers and what they go through. There are so many single parent mothers out there, which is what my mother was. I recognize what it takes to do that. So many people don't understand what that type of individual has to do. I wish we had players that had that that kind of work ethic, work habits, persistence and determination that so many mothers do. -- Snyder\n\nIn October 2004, the Finney household was changed forever.\n\nJ. Finney died of a heart attack, leaving his wife Christy on her own with four kids, including their youngest and only son, B.J.\n\nTo cope, Christy quit her better-paying position in Wichita, Kansas, and took two jobs in the Andale school district to be closer to her children, driving a bus in the mornings and afternoons while serving as a secretary in between during the day.\n\nB.J. Finney became an All-Big 12 performer at Kansas State under Snyder's tutelage. Charles Baus/CSM/AP Images\n\n\"It was overwhelming,\" Christy said. \"I was a mess for a long time. But I finally pulled myself together. I didn't have a choice.\"\n\nAfter the three girls graduated high school, it was just B.J. and Christy in the house. That pulled them even closer. She took him hunting, and whenever he needed it, she helped him with his homework.\n\nIn sports, B.J. blossomed into a state championship wrestler and standout offensive lineman. He was hoping for a football scholarship to Ohio University, but it never came. B.J.'s only FBS recourse was to walk-on at K-State. Christy knew what kind of financial strain that would bring. But she also wanted to help her son reach his dream. So she gave him one semester to earn a scholarship.\n\nWhile redshirting at K-State, B.J. did just that. Then, he won a starting job at center. Then, he became an All-Big 12 player.\n\nDuring B.J.'s first year, Christy received a Mother's Day card from Snyder, which caught her off-guard, especially since B.J., after all, was still just a walk-on.\n\n\"That was very emotional,\" Christy said. \"Very touching.\"\n\nSnyder would send four more Mother's Day cards to Christy. And after B.J.'s career ended last season, Christy wrote a long letter back to Snyder thanking him for the influence he had in B.J.'s life.\n\nSnyder, of course, responded with a letter back.\n\n\"The man B.J. has become is because of [Snyder],\" Christy said. \"I have the utmost respect and love for that man.\"", "Starting Wayne Ellington, Shane Larkin in second half sparks Brooklyn": "Despite Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh each scoring 24 points, the Heat fall to the Nets with Wayne Ellington scoring 26 points off the bench in a 111-105 victory. (1:13)\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets were on the verge of getting blown out again -- which prompted their coach to make a change.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t as drastic as he initially planned it to be, but Lionel Hollins\u2019 decision to start Wayne Ellington and Shane Larkin in the third quarter over Bojan Bogdanovic and Jarrett Jack paid off in the form of a huge comeback victory.\n\nEllington scored 23 of his 26 points in the second half, Larkin had all seven of his assists in the third quarter, and the Nets rallied back from a 16-point deficit to stun the Miami Heat 111-105 on Monday night. Brooklyn (9-22) improved to 3-12 on the road.\n\nOver the course of the season, some of Hollins\u2019 decisions haven\u2019t panned out the way he hoped they would.\n\nThis one certainly did.\n\nShane Larkin helped the Nets shoot 66.7 percent in the third quarter on Monday night.

(3:15)\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. -- Stephen Curry's greatness as a basketball player can be measured by his record-setting shooting numbers that are changing the game.\n\nHis immense popularity derives from something less tangible.\n\nWhile many NBA greats rely on uncommon height and athletic ability that average fans can only dream of having, Curry's game relies on the skills that every casual player can work on: shooting, dribbling and passing.\n\nThe difference is, perhaps nobody ever has put those three skills together the same way Curry has in the past year, as he has dominated on the court and made the once-downtrodden Golden State Warriors the NBA's must-watch team.\n\nWarriors star Stephen Curry joins LeBron James, Michael Jordan and Larry Bird as the only basketball players to win AP Male Athlete of the Year in the 85 years of the award. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\n\n\"The way that I play has a lot of skill but is stuff that if you go to the YMCA or rec leagues or church leagues around the country, everybody wants to shoot, everybody wants to handle the ball, make creative passes and stuff like that,\" he said. \"You can work on that stuff. Not everybody has the vertical or the physical gifts to be able to go out and do a windmill dunk and stuff like that. I can't even do it.\"\n\nThat's about all Curry is unable to do on the basketball court. His amazing year, in which he won an MVP, led Golden State to its first title in 40 years and helped the Warriors get off to a record-setting start this season earned him The Associated Press 2015 Male Athlete of the Year.\n\nCurry finished first in a vote by U.S. editors and news directors, with the results released Saturday. He joined LeBron James, Michael Jordan and Larry Bird as the only basketball players to win the honor in the 85 years of the award. Curry beat out golfer Jordan Spieth, who won two majors, and American Pharoah, who became the first horse since 1978 to win the Triple Crown.\n\nWhile American Pharoah got three more first-place votes than Curry's 24, Curry appeared on 86 percent of the 82 ballots that ranked the top five candidates. More than one-third of the voters left American Pharoah off their list.\n\n\"That's a real honor,\" Curry said. \"I'm appreciative of that acknowledgement because it's across all different sports. ... It's pretty cool.\"\n\nCurry has become the face of the NBA this past year. His jersey is the bestseller in the league; his team's games get record television ratings at home and in opposing markets and even his 3-year-old daughter, Riley, became a star by overshadowing her dad at playoff news conferences.\n\nEven his intricate warm-up routine has become a show for fans who get out early or even sometimes on TV pregame shows. He does an elaborate two-ball dribbling routine, works on passes and shots with both hands, takes jump shots from just inside half court and then caps it with a long-range shot from the tunnel on the way back to the locker room.\n\n\"Steph actually looks different,\" ESPN analyst Jalen Rose said. \"Like the best player in the league usually is also physically opposing -- 6-6 plus, scowl on his face, menacing. With the attitude that we appreciated because like a Michael Jordan or Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant, you know, just a cutthroat nature. Steph allows us into his living room. We see him on a national stage be a son, a dad, a husband, a father, a brother. And he does all of it while continuing to improve.\"\n\nCurry has improved his scoring from 23.8 points per game to 30.8 -- the biggest one-year jump ever by an MVP -- prompting Rose to say that Curry could be the most-improved player and repeat as MVP this season in a remarkable tribute to the offseason work he put in even after winning a title.\n\nHe has become much more efficient scoring on drives and has amazingly added range to his already record-setting 3-point shooting. Curry can consistently make shots from 28 feet out as he is on pace to shatter his own record of 3-pointers made in a season.\n\nThe drive to succeed is fueled by the fact that Curry got no major scholarship offers coming out of high school; he was the third point guard taken in the 2009 draft and he settled for a below-market contract extension three years ago because people questioned his durability after ankle injuries.\n\n\"The thing I would say about Steph, what makes him who he is, is that nobody has to challenge him to get to the next level because he does it on his own,\" coach Steve Kerr said. \"I didn't think he could get that much better from last year but I do think he's gotten considerably better, which is quite a feat when you're the reigning MVP.\"", "Aroldis Chapman would bring even more strikeouts to Yankees bullpen": "The New York Yankees have announced they have traded for Aroldis Chapman to a bullpen that was already one of the best in baseball at striking batters out.\n\nChapman has struck out 15.4 batters per nine innings pitched in his career, the highest rate in Major League Baseball history with a minimum of 100 innings pitched. He joins Dellin Betances (131 Ks) and Andrew Miller (100 Ks), who were the other two pitchers to strike out at least 100 batters last season alongside Chapman (116 Ks).\n\nFrom the Elias Sports Bureau: Assuming Aroldis Chapman, Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances open the season on the team, the 2016 Yankees will be the first team ever to feature three pitchers who had at least 100 strikeouts in relief the season before.\n\nYankees relief pitchers ranked first in MLB in strikeout percentage last season at 26.3 percent.

Chapman had 72 of those strikeouts in 2015 alone. Herrera and Arquimedes Caminero tied for second in baseball last year with four strikeouts on 100-mile-per-hour pitches.\n\nElite career ranks\n\nChapman has held opponents to a .154 batting average in his career.

There are challenges. I think they and we will have to get through it.\"\n\nReedie spoke after Rio organizers made their latest progress report to the International Olympic Committee executive board. The Brazilians outlined the progress they have made in venue construction over the past year, saying most of the facilities are now ready for South America's first Olympics.\n\n\"There has been a massive improvement of the situation in the past months,\" Reedie said. \"That's good news. Now you have to determine the service levels that athletes and international federations expect.\"\n\nBrazil's economy was booming when Rio was awarded the Games in 2009, but the country is now in its worst recession since the 1930s. The real has lost a third of its value this year, gross domestic product has tumbled, inflation is nearing 10 percent and unemployment has soared to nearly 8 percent.\n\nOn top of that, Brazil is mired in a spiraling kickback scandal centered on Petrobras, and Rousseff -- whose popularity rating has sunk to about 10 percent -- is facing impeachment proceedings based on allegations of fiscal irregularities by her government.\n\nRio Mayor Eduardo Paes, who has emerged as a central figure in the Olympic project, spoke to the IOC board by video conference from Brazil. Officials said he briefed the members about the economic problems and the impeachment process.\n\nRio organizers are trying to cut 2 billion reals ($530 million), or almost 30 percent, from their operating budget of 7.4 billion reals ($1.9 billion).

All the games are the same. We need to adjust everything and we are doing this with the IOC, the international federations and the NOCs (national Olympic committees).\n\n\"I think the most important thing is that nothing is affected for the athletes, that nothing affects the organization of the games,\" Nuzman added. \"We have been working for seven years.

The initial stadium proposal would have cost 252 billion yen ($2.1 billion), making it the most expensive stadium ever built.\n\nKuma's combined steel and wood structure, with a relatively flat roof with shrubbery along its outer concourses, echoes traditional temple designs. It stands 50 meters (164 feet) tall, with the track and field below ground level.\n\n\"This is a wonderful plan which meets the basic vision in the new construction plan and requirements for construction period and the budget,\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in announcing the choice.\n\nTuesday's announcement was a major step for organizers, who were forced to start over on a new design less than five years before the 2020 Games.\n\nThe scrapping of the initial stadium plan forced the 2019 Rugby World Cup to change venues, and the late change had raised concerns about whether it could even be completed in time for the Olympics.\n\nOrganizers also had to deal with a plagiarism scandal over the logo for the event, and an investigation last month found backroom dealings in the selection process.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that the design selection process was more transparent than that for the previous stadium plan, and also addressed the main problems: cost and post-Olympic use.\n\nThe winning project will be led by major construction company Taisei Corp. Lead architect Kuma, known for his Japanese aesthetic, has also designed Tokyo's kabuki theater that was renewed in 2013.\n\nOfficials said the design won by a small margin over the alternative plan led by architect Toyo Ito and three construction companies Takenaka, Shimizu and Obayashi.\n\nSuga said Kuma's plan was superior because of its ample environmental consideration and a possibility of shrinking the construction period.\n\nThe original plan by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid was criticized for its massive cost and scale.\n\nHadid said Japan's scrapping of her plan was \"shocking\" and that she said it was not about design or budget.\n\n\"In fact much of our two years of detailed design work and the cost savings we recommended have been validated by the remarkable similarities of our original detailed stadium layout and our seating bowl configuration with those of the design announced today,\" she said in a statement to The Associated Press.", "MLB's Strange But True Feats of 2015": "How downright illogical was the ever-unpredictable sport of baseball in 2015?\n\nSo illogical that one of our favorite pitchers \"played\" for three teams without ever throwing a pitch. ...

And so illogical that a team had to suspend one of its star players not because of insubordination but because of Instagram.\n\nBut frankly, we're as grateful as ever that all of that stuff really happened because it makes it possible for us to present what our pollsters tell us (after no actual polling) is absolutely, positively your favorite column of the year (and ours): The Strange But True Feats of the Year.\n\nWait. Make that two columns, come to think of it. Because one wouldn't possibly be enough. So first up, it's the Strange But True Regular-Season Feats of 2015. And you know what you'll get Tuesday? The Strange But True Postseason Feats of 2015. Naturally. So here we go. Let the strangeness begin.\n\nStrangest But Truest Man of the Year\n\nBronson Arroyo was a member of three different teams in 2015. But he didn't throw a single pitch. Mark J. Rebilas/USA TODAY Sports\n\nBronson Arroyo threw as many pitches in the big leagues this year as Old Hoss Radbourn. Or Miss Colombia. Or, well, as many as you, for that matter. So how did he win our prestigious Strangest But Truest Man of the Year Award? Glad you asked. Here's how ...\n\n\" Has anyone in history managed to \"play\" for three teams in one year without ever actually playing in a single game, for any team? It's possible, we guess. But we've never heard of it. And Bronson Arroyo had never heard of it, either. Not until it happened to him, anyway. Let's trace his incredible itinerary:\n\n\" He started the season, pretty much minding his own business, trying to rehab his previously ultra-durable right elbow after Tommy John surgery. For a couple of months, he did that as a proud member of the Arizona Diamondbacks. But then the Strange But True portion of his year kicked in.\n\n\" On June 20, Arizona shipped him (and, in a heavily related development, his $9.5 million salary) to the Atlanta Braves as part of the fascinating Touki Toussaint trade. So off went Arroyo to the Braves' Florida complex at Disney for a month, where he resumed rehabbing in the shadow of Pirates of the Caribbean and Splash Mountain. That fun lasted until July 30, when he took a bunch of Braves rookie leaguers to dinner. Suddenly, in the midst of those festivities, Arroyo reported, \"One of the young kids said to me, 'Hey, I think you just got traded to the Dodgers.' And I said, 'What?' He said, 'Yeah, I just saw it on Twitter.'\"\n\n\" Well, you can't believe everything you read on Twitter. So Arroyo immediately called the Braves' president of baseball operations, John Hart, to confirm that yet one more team had traded for him. Hart laughed and said: \"Yeah, we had to throw you in the deal.\" So with that, it was time for Arroyo to head off to those ever-innovative Los Angeles Dodgers, as part of a wild and crazy three-team extravaganza in which eight players, one competitive-balance draft pick and a bunch of money went flying all over the map.\n\n\" So, next thing he knew, Arroyo found himself back in Arizona, in the very same house he'd been living in when he was a Diamondback. Only instead of driving every morning to the Diamondbacks' rehab facility in Phoenix, he drove to the Dodgers' rehab facility in Glendale. He never did make it to Chavez Ravine, Hollywood or even to a rerun of \"L.A. Law.\" But on his list of official transactions, it still says he was a Dodger. What a country.\n\n\" So did that mean Bronson Arroyo played for three teams in 40 days or no teams? That's the kind of question that keeps us Strange But True aficionados awake at night. So we figured we'd better get Arroyo's take.\n\n\"I'll put it this way,\" he said. \"If I retired tomorrow and somebody asked which teams I played for, I'd never mention the Braves or Dodgers. Heck, I never set foot in their locker rooms. I was just kind of on vacation, throwing bullpens.\"\n\n\" Now before we wrap this up, let's put Arroyo's fascinating travels in perspective. Felix Hernandez, Justin Verlander and Matt Cain have each been pitching in the major leagues since 2005. They've pitched a combined 33 seasons and made a combined 943 starts -- and never been traded. Not once. But Arroyo somehow got traded twice -- in a season in which there was next to no chance he would ever throw a pitch. Is this a crazy sport, or what?\n\n\" Oh, and one more thing. We counted 40 pitchers who spent at least 150 days on the disabled list this year. As best we can tell, Arroyo got traded twice as many times as the other 39 combined. (And if it weren't for Matt Harrison, who got dealt from Texas to Philadelphia in a three-week window between DL stints, that total would have been zero.) So we know Arroyo is the only player of 2015 to land on the 60-day disabled list of three teams. The question is whether he's the only player ever.\n\n\"Three teams, and I never threw an official pitch,\" Arroyo said, chuckling over the insanity of it all. \"And I was coming off Tommy John, so everyone knew I probably wouldn't pitch a game all year. I don't know if anyone else can say they ever did that.\"\n\nYeah, good chance. But with all these new \"Ivy League grads\" now running half the teams in baseball, Arroyo said, \"I bet things are going to be done now that have never been done before. It wouldn't surprise me if this becomes more and more normal.\"\n\nOK, he might be right. But if we're really heading for a world where a season like this stops being Strangest But Truest Man of the Year material to \"normal,\" this column might have to cease operations!\n\nFive Strangest But Truest Injuries of the Year\n\n\" On his way to retirement, Giants pitcher Jeremy Affeldt sealed his first-ballot election to the Strange But True Hall of Fame by getting hurt on (what else?) an off day. Took his kids to a lake. Slipped off an inflatable platform. And kaboom, he was back on the DL with a \"patellar subluxation\" in his left knee. Which, according to the Giants' surgeon general, Dr. Bruce Bochy, is a medical term for \"Jeremy being Jeremy.\"\n\n\" Here's one thing we learned this year: The only thing in baseball that's more dangerous than a beanball is, of course, a beanbag. As our first witness, we call Oakland reliever Fernando Abad. He tried to plop down into a beanbag chair one day. But apparently, he's going to have to work on that move in spring training because he missed his strike zone, also known as \"the chair.\" He also missed the next week and a half with a bruised tailbone -- but a spectacular tale of how he bruised it.\n\n\" We found out again this year that White Sox ace Chris Sale is unhittable. We also found out, however, that he isn't unbreakable. You'd think there would be nothing that could stop this man from pitching on Opening Day. But here's what did: his truck. He was unloading it during spring training, neglected to stick the landing and broke a bone in his foot. Next time, he might want to hire a few Teamsters.\n\n\" April showers bring, um, let's see now, something or other. Pretty sure our grandmothers once used to warn us about whatever the heck it was. But nobody warned Brewers second baseman Scooter Gennett, who was taking an April shower after a game in Pittsburgh -- and cut his hand reaching for the body wash. That was the bad news (for him). But here's the good news (for the rest of us): He was helpful enough to tweet about it!\n\nCan't believe it! Literally trying to grab some body wash in the shower (post game in Pittsburgh) and... https://t.co/TO1j6BRuQH Scooter Gennett (@Sgennett2) April 20, 2015\n\n\" Finally, we'd love to tell you that some injuries are nothing to sneeze at -- but that's one beloved clich\u00e9 that sure doesn't apply to this year. First, Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar ah-chooed his way into the news by pulling an oblique this spring -- by sneezing. But that wasn't even the sneezing mishap of the year. That award goes to Nationals outfielder Reed Johnson. He probably thought he'd accumulated enough injuries this summer, when he (A) hurt his foot and (B) got drilled in the ribs while playing on a rehab assignment. But then he completed this trifecta by really aggravating that rib injury -- with a mega-sneeze. So what can we say? Just one thing: Gesundheit!\n\nFive Strangest But Truest Replay Moments of the Year\n\n\" You think it's cool to score the winning run? How about scoring it twice in one game? Happened to Ian Kinsler on Sept. 19. The run he thought he'd scored in the ninth got overturned. So he just had to return to the scene of the crime in the 11th and mash a walk-off homer. Overturn that!\n\n\" Where Mookie Betts went this year, stuff just kept on happening. And we should have known because, in the very first inning of the Red Sox home opener, he stole second and third base on the same pitch (thanks to the miracle of shifting). And the Nationals were so delighted, they challenged the \"safe\" calls at both bases -- and got rejected by the replay pooh-bahs on both of them. So that went well.\n\n\" Nobody could possibly have gotten more down on modern technology this year than Josh Donaldson. He had two home runs taken away by the replay machines in one game, on Sept. 8. Where are those local blackouts when you need them?\n\n\" Khris Davis, on the other hand, might never feel the same again about the human element. On May 25, he launched a first-inning home run, circled the bases, then got called out for (gulp) missing home plate. But wait. Three minutes and 20 technologically efficient seconds later, it turned out he touched that plate after all. So it turned into the longest home run trot of the year. But hey, justice was served.\n\n\" Not only did the Red Sox hit for the cycle this year (courtesy of Brock Holt), they also got tangled up in the first replay cycle in history (as far as we know). In their Sept. 19 game against the Rays, they inspired the boys in New York to review plays at first base, second, third and home. And even better, those reviews were initiated by both teams and the umpiring crew. Might be the greatest day in technology since Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone.\n\n10 Strangest But Truest Role Reversals of the Year\n\n\" In case we forgot to break into regularly scheduled programming to mention this, a tremendous record was set this year: most games ever pitched by position players in one season (27). But it was tough to top Mystery Pitcher appearance No. 27 -- by the one, the only Ichiro, pitching for the first time since the 1996 Japanese All-Star Game, on the last day of the season. In what we believe was the greatest hits mismatch ever, he headed to the mound with 2,935 hits. The five Phillies hitters he faced had 430 combined.\n\n\" And those 27 position-player appearances don't even count another historic moment in Mystery Pitching: Cliff Pennington doing what no position player had ever done -- pitching for the Blue Jays in an actual postseason game. (That would be Game 4 of the ALCS.) On one hand, that wasn't what the Blue Jays had in mind. On the other hand, his fastball averaged 90.7 miles per hour. Which was 7 mph swifter than that of their starter that day (R.A. Dickey).\n\n\" So how wacky did that Mystery Pitcher craze get? Three teams -- the Rays, Indians and White Sox -- all ran two position players out there to pitch in the same game at some point. No AL team had done that in a nine-inning game in 37 years before that. ... In just the eight days between June 12 and June 20, eight different position players pitched (and allowed 13 runs, for what it's worth). ... The Yankees faced four position players in the same season. ... One of those Yankees, Chris Young, hit a homer off one position player (Jonny Gomes) but struck out against another (Adam Rosales). ... There hadn't been any day since 1979 in which three position players pitched on the same day. And then, naturally, it happened two days in a row this year (June 16 and 17). ... And four mystery men were allowed to pitch twice this year: Rosales, David Ross, Ike Davis and Jesus Sucre. Not only did Ross go six-up, six-down in his two outings for the Cubs but he also hit a home run after his 1-2-3 inning July 26. So he somehow managed to get through the year as the only catcher in baseball to homer as a pitcher but not as a catcher? You bet he did.\n\n\" And let's not forget Wilson Ramos' place in Mystery Pitcher History. In a June 16 game in Tampa Bay, he homered off Jake Elmore in the eighth inning, then homered again off Nick Franklin in the ninth. And you know how many other players who debuted in the expansion era have even hit home runs against two different position players at any point in their whole careers, let alone one game? That answer, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, would be zero. But Wilson Ramos did it on the same night. In back-to-back innings. Because baseball happened.\n\n\" That game at Tropicana Field got so mixed up, by the way, that, in the ninth inning, the Nationals sent a pitcher (Joe Ross) out to pinch hit for their DH (Yunel Escobar). Which meant a National League pitcher had just turned into a DH for the first time in history. And Ross then batted against -- what else? -- a position player (Franklin). In a game in an AL park. Perfect. ... But even more incredibly, exactly two months later, an Orioles-A's game turned so upside-down that an AL position player (Ike Davis) wound up pitching to an AL pitcher (Jason Garcia) and -- what else? -- walked him! On four pitches! You can't make this stuff up, friends.\n\n\" And here's to Brendan Ryan and Jeff Francoeur. They both did something Craig Kimbrel hasn't done in four years: get the last six outs of a game. Francoeur actually threw 48 pitches -- which was 22 more than his team's starting pitcher (Jerome Williams) threw that night. And Ryan zipped through two shutout innings. Last Yankees position player to get that many outs: Gene Michael, in 1968!\n\n\" Meanwhile, there were some great moments in pitchers at the dish, too. Like this: Randy Choate made it to the plate for the first time in 11 years -- and Mets reliever Jack Leathersich promptly walked him.\n\n\" And this: Two American League pitchers hit a home run this year. The first (Nathan Karns) accounted for the only run in a 1-0 game. The second (Daniel Norris) didn't even get a win out of it -- because he pulled an oblique three innings later.\n\n\" And this: Four Giants pitchers homered in September. Which would have been pretty amazing no matter what. But especially amazing was this: None of them was named Madison Bumgarner, who had hit all 12 of the homers hit by Giants pitchers between Sept. 1, 2012, and Sept. 1, 2015.\n\n\" Finally, speaking of MadBum, we'd like to thank him for all of this: (A) He outhomered Matt Holliday this year (5-4). (B) He pinch hit in back-to-back games and homered in back-to-back starts -- in the same week. (C) As our buddy Buster Olney pointed out, he not only was sent up to pinch hit against Aroldis Chapman but was the first player all year to fall behind Chapman, 0 and 2, yet wind up drawing a walk. And (D) he did something that Pablo Sandoval, Albert Pujols and Justin Upton have never done: hit a home run off Clayton Kershaw. But then came this postscript: Guess who had the longest at-bat against Bumgarner all year? Right you are. Clayton Kershaw (13 pitches).\n\n10 Strangest But Truest Hitting Feats of the Year\n\nTodd Frazier suffered through the longest home run drought of his career in 2015 -- but there's a very good reason no one remembers it. David Kohl/USA TODAY Sports\n\n\" Want proof that actually swinging is overrated? On Sept. 3, Bryce Harper got through an entire game without swinging at a single pitch -- and still scored four runs. Meanwhile in Chicago, Melky Cabrera swung at 23 pitches that day -- and scored no runs.\n\n\" Billy Hamilton really did hit a home run this year before Giancarlo Stanton -- but, in an even bigger upset, got out-tripled by Evan Gattis. Then again, so did a lot of people. Gattis' mind-boggling stat line: 11 triples, 0 stolen bases. First man in 75 years to hit that many triples but forget to steal a base. Of course he was!\n\n\" But nobody was more convinced that everything happens in threes than Royals rookie Paulo Orlando. He had to wait until age 29 to reach the big leagues. But once he got there, every time he looked up, he was dusting himself off at third base. Here are his first seven career hits, courtesy of loyal tweeter Ed Bartel: triple, triple, triple, single, triple, single, triple. So that's more triples in his first seven hits than Victor Martinez has unfurled in his first 1,776 hits.\n\n\" Rockies masher Nolan Arenado homered in six straight games in September. But over the first five, we're betting he did something no one else has ever done: hit a home run in five consecutive games -- but not even hit the most homers on his own team in that span. He can blame Carlos Gonzalez, who ripped off three straight multihomer games. And in answer to your question before you ask it, of course they were playing at Coors Field. You were expecting maybe the Polo Grounds?\n\n\" Bet you didn't know that Todd Frazier went through the longest homerless streak of his career this year (63 plate appearances). But you probably don't remember it -- because in the middle of all that, he won the Home Run Derby. Of course he did.\n\n\" You definitely can't accuse Gordon Beckham of loving his dad more than his mom. He got a walk-off hit on Mother's Day. Then he got a walk-off hit on Father's Day. And you know how many walk-off hits he got in the other 98 games he played this year? Right. That would be zero.\n\n\" And while we're in that holiday spirit, sound those trombones, because what could be more patriotic than a Sousa (OK, so it was a Souza) hitting a tying homer in the ninth inning on the Fourth of July? So what if it was Steven Souza, not John Philip Sousa? Anybody know the tune to \"Semper Fidelis\"?\n\n\" Apparently, Xander Bogaerts is a morning person -- because, on April 10, the Red Sox played a 19-inning game at Yankee Stadium, and he went 0-for-4 before midnight but 4-for-4 after midnight. If the Red Sox were as innovative as they're reputed to be, wouldn't they play a few 12:05 a.m. games, just to see if that was a trend?\n\n\" Think it's safe to say the Mariners' catchers were offensively challenged? They hit .159, with a .464 OPS, this year. The Giants' pitchers hit .162, with a .463 OPS. The Mariners used five catchers. They got 86 hits combined. Meanwhile in San Francisco, Buster Posey got 86 hits by the Fourth of July. So, how have the Mariners addressed that this winter? They signed a catcher who hit .188 (Chris Iannetta) -- and that's an upgrade!\n\n\" Then there's all this stuff you undoubtedly never saw coming: Ben Revere hit a home run off Max Scherzer. ... J.T. Realmuto drove in five runs in one inning. ... Curt Casali had back-to-back multihomer games. ...The Cardinals used five pinch hitters in the same inning. ... The Pirates played a game in which they walked 10 times, had 16 baserunners and got shut out. ... Jackie Bradley Jr. whomped 11 consecutive extra-base hits. ... Derek Norris struck out four times in a row May 29, then bopped a walk-off grand slam. ... Bartolo Colon got an infield hit -- and \"sprinted\" to first in a glacial 7.4 seconds. ... And a team that won 100 games (the Cardinals) got shut out three times in a row by a team that lost 95 games (the Braves). No kidding!\n\nStrangest But Truest Pitching Feats of the Year\n\n\" You know how people say wins are a meaningless stat? How about losses? Shelby Miller led the National League in losses, with 17 -- and still had a lower ERA (3.02) than seven of the 18 starting pitchers who got Cy Young votes this year.\n\n\" Did anyone have a Stranger But Truer September than Rich Hill had in Boston? Did you know Madison Bumgarner, Zack Greinke, Adam Wainwright and Cole Hamels have never spun off three double-digit strikeout games in a row? But guess who did? A 35-year-old left-hander who spent part of his year in the rotation of the Long Island Ducks, hadn't made a big league start in six years and hadn't had a 10-strikeout game in eight years. One of the great Strange But True sagas of modern times.\n\n\" The bad news for Colby Lewis was: He was the only pitcher in the American League to give up 10 runs in a game twice this year. The good news for Colby Lewis was: He was literally unbeatable (as in 11-0) over an 18-start stretch from May to August when he didn't give up 10 runs. Here's to the joys of single figures.\n\n\" Exactly once in the history of the Royals had they ever pulled a pitcher working on a no-hitter in the sixth inning or later. Then, naturally, Ned Yost did it twice this year -- to the same guy (Chris Young). So Chris, about pitch counts: Your thoughts?\n\n\" The Phillies were a Strange But True phenomenon unto themselves. But since they were creative enough to become the first team since 1900 to get through a whole season without a seven-game winner, they inspired loyal tweeter Christopher Long's favorite tidbit of the year: Cole Hamels managed to tie for their team lead in wins -- while actually winning more games for another team. (He went 7-1 with the Rangers.)\n\n\" OK, one more on the Phillies: They got within one game of tying the modern National League record for most games in a row without a win by a starter, but picked a great time to break that streak (at 25) -- thanks to a win by a pitcher who was 0-6 in the minor leagues (Adam Morgan).\n\n\" You know which pitcher retired 32 hitters in a row this year? No, not Max Scherzer, Jake Arrieta or Zack Greinke. It was Wandy Rodriguez, of course. For the Rangers. Who released him three months later.\n\n\" Strange But True Drill Sergeant Dept.: Remember Pat Misch? In a May 4 start for those New Orleans Zephyrs, he drilled the first four hitters he faced (including the final three on three pitches in a row). And what makes this extra Strange But True? In his six seasons in the big leagues, he never hit four batters in one year.\n\n\" Strange But True Drill Sergeant Dept., Part 2: Mark Buehrle managed to plunk Rays HBP magnet Brandon Guyer with four pitches this year. Which would be one more time than Mark Buehrle hit the other 195 hitters he faced put together.\n\nWait! One bonus Strange But True Buehrle note: He finally figured out a way to win a game against the Yankees this year -- for the first time in 11 years. It took him so long, he won 148 games in between against teams not named the Yankees.\n\n\" And guess what? We saved the best for last in this section because Jake Arrieta's second half was one giant Strange But True compendium. But rather than devote the next 48,000 words to this dude, we're going to restrain ourselves and present our three most astounding SBT Arrieta-isms: (1) Over his last 18 starts of the season, the Cubs went 17-1 -- and in the only loss, they got no-hit (of course they did) by Cole Hamels. (2) Over his last 20 starts, he hit as many homers as he allowed (two). And (3) if you'd started your clicker on Aug. 1, you'd have counted 269 pitchers who allowed at least four earned runs in an inning. And while all that was going on, Arrieta was also allowing four earned runs -- in two months. So get the picture? He was pretty good.\n\n10 Strangest But Truest Box Score Lines of the Year\n\nYankees shortstop Didi Gregorius did something in 2015 that his predecessor, the great Derek Jeter, never did. USA TODAY Sports\n\n\" When I asked all you Strange But True fans in the Twitterverse to nominate your SBT favorite of the year, about 50 of you reminded me of this: Andrew Cashner got only 14 outs in his June 1 start against the Mets -- but he still managed to cram 12 strikeouts and 11 hits into his box score line. That means he faced 25 hitters -- and 23 of them either got a hit or struck out. Which can be rough on a guy's BABIP.\n\n\" But here's the best part: That was the first game in the history of baseball in which a pitcher piled up at least 10 whiffs and 10 hits without making it through the fifth inning. So it took 140 seasons for it to happen once -- and exactly one day for it to happen again. Because Noah Syndergaard did it the next night. In the same ballpark. Because of course he did.\n\n\" While we're on this strikeout roll, human SBT note machine Corey Kluber made a May 13 start against the Cardinals in which he faced 26 hitters -- and struck out 18 of them. That was in one night. Meanwhile, Chad Billingsley faced 165 hitters this year -- that was in seven starts -- and struck out 15 of them.\n\n\" It's safe to say Jeremy Guthrie isn't as big a fan of Yankee Stadium as, say, Babe Ruth. In his May 25 visit to the Bronx, he gave up 11 earned runs. And four homers. And allowed 13 baserunners. And got three outs. So who else has ever done that, you ask? Nobody has ever done that, we answer.\n\n\" But now let's make Jeremy Guthrie feel at least slightly better. Before he got to the mound, exactly one starting pitcher in the live-ball era had found a way to give up 11 earned runs without making it through at least the second inning. It then happened three times just this year. David Buchanan and Chris Rusin were such big fans of Guthrie's work, they also did it, within a week and a half of each other, in August.\n\n\" Have we ever mentioned that not all blown saves are created equal? Cody Allen took the mound April 20 with a 3-0 lead over the White Sox, then faced eight hitters in the ninth -- and got one of them out. His outing went: Strikeout, double, walk, wild pitch, double, single, single, single, single, drive home safely.\n\n\" Then again, not all saves are created equal, either. Adam Warren, for instance, saved one game this year. On July 28. In a 21-5 game. If you're scoring at home, that ranks him No. 3 on the Cheapest Saves of the 21st Century list, behind Wes Littleton (saved the fabled 30-3 game in 2007) and Willie Banks (saved a 22-4 game in 2002).\n\n\" But we're still not sure that was any crazier than this: In an actual June 12 game in Houston, Felix Hernandez allowed more home runs (two) than he got outs (one). His catcher, Jesus Sucre, wound up pitching a scoreless inning that day. Felix gave up eight runs. Yeah, really.\n\n\" So what did Didi Gregorius do this year that Derek Jeter never did? Drive in six runs in one game, that's what. On Aug. 28. You can look it up. Jeter played 2,505 games for the Yankees, by the way, counting the postseason. This was Gregorius' 120th. Baseball is awesome.\n\n\" But that still wasn't the Strangest But Truest box score line by a player in New York this year. Because who could top Kirk Nieuwenhuis' epic 4-3-3-4 show July 12, in which he became the first player in the history of the Mets to hit three homers in a game in New York? So which is more incredible? That Mike Piazza, David Wright and Howard Johnson never hit three home runs in a game for the Mets -- or that Nieuwenhuis almost made it through the whole season without hitting any other homers. Alas, he messed up that note with a Sept. 8 game winner off Jonathan Papelbon. Why was he celebrating?\n\n10 More Strange But True Classics\n\nThe first rain delay of 2015 happened Opening Day at Marlins Park, which has a roof. Because of course it did. Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\n\" How did this happen? The Indians lost the first seven games started this year by the incumbent Cy Young Award winner, Corey Kluber.\n\n\" And how did this happen? The Red Sox played an April 10 game in New York in which they blew leads in the 16th and 18th innings -- and still won. But the Giants played a game six days later in which they scored in the seventh, ninth, 10th and 12th innings -- and still lost.\n\n\" And how did this happen? The Red Sox also played a game on July 5 in which their first basemen somehow made it through all nine innings without recording a single putout. It was the 17,867th game in Red Sox history. It was the first in which their first baseman didn't record at least one out. So want to guess what happened in their very next game? The first ball put in play was (what else?) a 3-unassisted. What else?\n\n\" And how did this happen? The Braves and Phillies played a three-game series in which the score of every game was Braves 2, Phillies 1. Which was almost as insane as the Mets winning two straight games in Denver by the score of 14-9. So how random was that? There were no other games played all year, by anybody, that ended 14-9.\n\n\" And how did this happen? From Opening Day through Sept. 12, there wasn't a single game in which a team found itself down by at least three runs with two out and nobody on in the ninth and then won. Then the Mets and Astros both did it -- on the same day (Sept. 13). Because of course they did.\n\n\" And how did this happen? The Twins got a triple from three hitters in the same inning of their June 14 game in Texas -- but scored only one run. (So how did that happen? Shane Robinson got picked off third by Robinson Chirinos after triple No. 2. That's how.)\n\n\" Strangest But Truest Great Moments in Managing: The Padres lost three games in 48 hours -- with three different managers. ... And the Brewers went through the entire month of April without winning a series, then won their first series in May -- and (naturally) fired their manager (Ron Roenicke) after the game.\n\n\" Strangest But Truest No-Hitter Epidemic: Chase Utley played 13 seasons in Philadelphia and got no-hit only once. Then he became a Dodger -- and got no-hit twice in his first nine games in L.A. But what really made this a Strange But True all-timer was this: The same three Dodgers made the last three outs in both no-hitters (Utley, Jimmy Rollins and Justin Turner).\n\n\" Strangest But Truest Social Media Debacle: The Red Sox waited all year for Pablo Sandoval to get hot. Instead, he got suspended in June -- because of \"hotties.\" During a midgame bathroom break, he made sure to focus on what really mattered. By \"liking\" photos of a bunch of attractive females on Instagram. And this just in: All Instagram \"likes\" are accessible only to a small group consisting of ... the entire rest of the planet.\n\n\" Strangest But Truest Delays of the Year: Why was a June 15 Tigers game delayed? Because they couldn't start the third inning until Yoenis Cespedes came out of the bathroom. ... A Florida State League game in Tampa was called on account of a circus (seriously) -- because a bunch of blinking lights on a tent across the street were messing with the hitters' vision. ... An Angels-Royals spring training game was delayed on account of bees. ... And finally, the very first rain delay of 2015 occurred in Miami, in a ballpark that had never had a rain delay before. Then again, there's a good reason for that. It has a roof on it. The Marlins just couldn't get it closed in time. Because, if they had, they'd be putting us Strange But True Feats of the Year aficionados out of business. And that would be just plain wrong.", "Justin Gallegos overcoming cerebral palsy to inspire fellow high school runners": "As a high school cross country and track coach, Darren James likes to tell his athletes that running is a metaphor for life.\n\nJames says if they can tune out that inner voice screaming for them to quit when things get difficult, or if they can get back up when they fall or shake off a bad race, they'll forge a strength that will serve them the rest of their lives.\n\nYet, as a teacher, James says he's no match for Justin Gallegos.\n\nJustin, a 17-year-old senior distance runner for James at Hart High School in Santa Clarita, California, has cerebral palsy. His gait isn't smooth. His motion isn't efficient. He doesn't have the muscle coordination most people take for granted. Even when he's running at top speed, Justin is no match for his teammates or most of his opponents. Many times, he's finished last. Nothing comes easy.\n\nYet he's worked hard and improved consistently since Day 1 as a freshman. And that, says James, is why he's such a wonderful teacher.\n\n\"He can sit there in front of the team and talk about the dedication you have to put in and how you fight when it gets difficult and all of those things, and when he says it, it's like a thunderbolt strike,\" says James. \"It's a lot more powerful than when you hear it from someone like me. I think the kids respond to that.\n\n\"When he's out there, I think it's crystal clear to them what that endeavor is, what he's bringing to the table, what he's doing, because they see it and they hear it every single day.\"\n\nWhich is why, in many races, Justin's teammates, coaches, parents, classmates and even opponents line the race route as he approaches the finish line to cheer and shout their encouragement.\n\n\"I think that could be misinterpreted why people run out there and do that,\" says James. \"It's definitely his influence and the inspiration he brings.\"\n\nIt's not out of pity for a runner with no hope of winning. It's out of respect for one with uncommon desire.\n\nFalling and getting back up\n\nJustin wanted to do something athletic and be part of a team in high school. He thought about going out for football as a freshman, but his father, Brent, counseled him to try cross country.\n\n\"I don't like to discourage him or tell him things that he can't do,\" says Brent. \"I was just reluctant obviously (and said), 'As your father I'm concerned you're going to get hurt.'\"\n\nSo the two talked to James and fellow cross country coach Larry David. Brent told them Justin had done a lot of work on the treadmill and assured them his son could run the three miles required in a cross country race, and that he would work hard. Both coaches encouraged Justin to come out.\n\nAt first, it was rough.\n\n\"He fell quite a bit in the first week or so, to the point where I started wondering if it was going to work out,\" says Brent. Justin's knees and elbows took a beating. He had cuts, scrapes and bruises. Brent even bought his son kneepads to cushion the falls.\n\n\"He never once said 'I don't want to do this,' or 'I need a break,' or 'I need some time off,'\" says Brent. \"If he got hurt that day, nine out of 10 times he would just pick himself up and start running again even though his knees were bleeding.\"\n\nJustin says he had to get used to the new routine and the hours and the training. Despite the falls, he liked it. His coaches and teammates accepted him and he could feel himself getting better.\n\n\"I see it as a way to keep improving on myself,\" says Justin. \"In the past, and still sometimes here and there, I've fallen frequently. I fall more than most of my other teammates just because of how I walk and how my stride is. But over the years I've progressively fallen less and less. I've become a faster runner and improved on my stride.\"\n\nThe coaches have a no-cut approach. As long as students show up and work hard, they can be on the team. James says Justin -- who's been running for the junior varsity -- is an incredible worker.\n\nBrent admits Justin was discouraged at times early on by finishing last or falling. But he always bounced back. After some time, he embraced the concept of running against the clock instead of opponents. At first, his goals were modest. He wanted to break 30 minutes in cross country by the end of his freshman year. He broke that in his first race.\n\n\"For me, that was definitely a sign that we were moving in the right direction and that cross country was going to be something that was going to work for me,\" says Justin.\n\nDuring the past three years, his improvement has been steady in cross country in the fall and on the track (800 meters, mile and 2-mile) in the spring. The exercise and hard work paid off.\n\n\"I feel like I've gotten a lot stronger because of the fact I train every day and strengthen my core muscles and my leg muscles,\" Justin says. \"I think it's helped me walk better, too.\"\n\nThis year, he set a personal best at the Woodbridge Cross Country Classic by running 23:58. He says the time made him feel \"ecstatic.\"\n\nAs a freshman, James says Justin ran about 8:30 in the mile. Last spring the goal was for him to go under 7:30.\n\n\"He exceeded that and ran 7:14, and I think he's going to go under 7 and probably approach 6:30 (this spring),\" says James. \"His improvement has been really great.\"\n\nAs a senior, he's run all the courses multiple times, so he can focus on his PRs. When he doesn't set one, says Brent, laughing, \"He's not happy.\"\n\nDuring the past four years, Justin has become well-known among other Foothill League teams and runners. Often, he says, opponents will congratulate him after races.\n\n\"I feel like we almost know all of each other, even though we really don't,\" he says.\n\nJames recalls a 1,600-meter race last spring when Justin achieved a goal of breaking 8 minutes, a mark his teammates could sense was in reach as the race unfolded:\n\n\"He's coming down the last straightaway and the kids are running back and forth across the infield and all lined up along the straightaway knowing that here comes this huge goal, and he ended up running like 7:54 that night and broke it.\"\n\nJames says he's had the privilege of coaching runners who ran terrific times, \"but that 7:54 was no less significant in the scheme of things. And the energy around it was really cool.\"\n\nThe final race\n\nA few months ago, Justin was the subject of a 5-minute documentary made by one of his classmates, Luke Peckham, called \"No Such Thing As A Disability: the story of a runner with cerebral palsy.\"\n\nJustin Gallegos hopes to continue running competitively after high school, and says running will be a part of his life for the rest of his life. Courtesy Lori Peterson\n\nLuke, who's known Justin since the seventh grade, gave Justin the chance to talk about what it's like to run with cerebral palsy and what he's hoping to prove. Clips of Justin running on the school track are woven into clips of the interview.\n\nLuke says it was an opportunity to tell the story of a passionate person.\n\n\"Everybody admires Justin for how hard he works for what he wants,\" says Luke of the respect Justin's peers have for him. \"People are astonished, so enthused, that he works so hard and does so well.\"\n\nTo Justin, it's been a lot of work, but also his passion. Since he started running, he's become a student of cross country and track. He reads about the sports, the athletes and the finest feats. He says running will be a part of his life forever, and he hopes to continue in college for a club or school team. Someday, he'd like to compete in the Paralympics.\n\n\"It's helped me become stronger physically and mentally,\" he says. \"It's helped me learn to never back down from my challenge and always give your best at something. I've learned just because I have a disability, I can still do my best at running and improve.\"\n\nOn Nov. 5, Justin ran the final cross country race of his high school career. For the first time, he ran for the varsity team.\n\nMore than 11 minutes after the winner crossed the finish line and almost five minutes after every other runner was done, Justin came in at 26:23.71. Like so many previous races, his final strides turned into a celebration.\n\n\"He's like 300, 400 yards away and everyone started screaming and clapping all the way until he got there,\" says Luke. \"It was very cool.\"\n\nJustin called it an \"awesome\" and yet \"bittersweet moment.\"\n\nJames says the familiar sight of Justin putting total effort into every workout and every race has connected with many.\n\n\"Everyone knows who Justin is in the (Santa Clarita) Valley, so the Valley kind of rallies behind him,\" says James. \"And it's so cool, because often times he is the last guy to come across the line, and we've been competitive and at each other all day long, and the day always wraps with this perspective, right?\n\n\"Justin coming across the line and everybody, regardless of what color singlet they have on, everyone's out there supporting him.\"", "Roger Federer's sneak attack a prelude of tennis in 2016?": "This past season will indisputably go down in tennis history as the Year of Novak Djokovic. The 28-year-old top-ranked player won three majors, shattered a record by winning six Masters 1000 titles (in eight finals). He also reached 15 consecutive finals and compiled an 82-6 record, including 31-5 against top-10 opponents. So this is as good a place to start with our look at five takeaways from the year in ATP tennis:\n\n1. Domination isn't just possible, it's likely: Remember back in the days immediately after aging Pete Sampras released his stranglehold on the game? Starting at the US Open of 2000, seven different men won the next seven consecutive majors, and 10 different players won the ensuing 13, ending with Andy Roddick's win at the US Open in 2013.\n\nAt the time, everyone said that the game had gotten too demanding and that there were just too many great players for anyone ever to dominate in the future. Then Roger Federer matured. That gave rise to the theory that he's a once-in-a-millennium player, the exception that proves the rule. Consider that debunked. The reality is that tennis has thrived with one boss, despite brief interludes when no one is in charge.\n\nRoger Federer showed us a new way to return serve in 2015. Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images\n\n2. Offense is in the game plan again: Roger Federer's SABR (Sneak Attack by Roger) strategy really livened up the summer and fall. That exaggerated interpretation of the familiar chip-and-charge tactic paid off in a big way for Federer only once or twice, but it's a perfect emblem for the great awakening that has taken place in the ATP.\n\nNumerous pros are now playing more balanced games, relying on approach shots and volleys, if not outright serve-and-volley tennis to win points. The poster boy for the trend may be Federer, but the guy who really embodies this trend is Feliciano Lopez. The 34-year-old Spaniard has a big, lefty hook serve and he loves to serve and volley. He finished in the top 20 for the second year in a row (No. 17). He wasn't in that league before he embraced his attacking instincts.\n\n3. The phenom is extinct: It's a great time to be a veteran tennis player, just ask Federer, Tommy Haas, Lopez or a score of other over 30-year-old players. A potential phenom, a la young Andre Agassi, Lleyton Hewitt or Rafael Nadal?\n\nNot so much.\n\nThere are numerous promising young players (under 21 or close to it) on the ATP Tour -- Borna Coric, Hyeon Chung, Dominic Thiem, Nick Kyrgios, Thanasi Kokkinakis -- but none of them are seem ready to make the big breakthrough. Some that once did, like Grigor Dimitrov or Bernard Tomic, have found it difficult to maintain their momentum and push into the elite category.\n\n4. The Davis Cup overfloweth: It wasn't so long ago that all kinds of people were calling for deep reform of Davis Cup, the voices in the U.S. especially loud. You don't hear them so much anymore. That's because the great spread of talent has made a dozen nations competitive, and the prestige of, and interest in, the competition has skyrocketed.\n\nAndy Murray's commitment to Davis Cup is especially noteworthy, given how unlikely it seemed at the start of the year that Great Britain could win the event. But because of the genius of the format, the British crafted a wonderful story that resonated powerfully throughout the global sports community. With so many nations now competitive and sports fans worldwide enamored of nations-based competition, the Davis Cup may be entering a golden age.\n\n5. Clay has a summer season: Of the nine tournaments between the end of Wimbledon and the first big pre-US Open hard-court Masters 1000 of August, one is on grass and just three are on hard courts. The other five are on clay in Europe, in what has become a viable and, to European players, welcome option to the preponderance of hard courts on the ATP Tour.\n\nThose events are all low-key ATP 250s with the exception of Hamburg, an ATP 500. Hamburg once was a 1000 (Masters), played after the Rome 1000 (or Italian Open). The promoters unsuccessfully fought demotion and an accompanying change of date (done to make room for the current Madrid 1000), but the ATP prevailed.\n\nThe promoters of Hamburg, often plagued by damp, cold weather back when it was a spring 1000, are probably now thinking that maybe things didn't work out so badly after all.", "new coach Ljubicic has remarkable tale to tell": "Roger Federer has appointed a new coach who has one of the most remarkable stories in tennis -- whose route to the elite included fleeing the Balkan Wars by cargo plane and bus before living in a refugee camp.\n\nIvan Ljubicic's tale of escape, and of being \"a refugee of war\", is one that Federer knows well. The Croatian he has appointed to replace Stefan Edberg has been a close friend for many years.\n\nLiving in Banja Luka, an area dominated by Serbians which is now part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ljubicic grew up with his family watching on as \"people disappeared\".\n\nAfter growing increasingly concerned for their safety, they left on a plane, before a long bus journey around Hungary and Slovenia took them to a refugee camp in Croatia.\n\nFrom there, the Ljubicic family rebuilt their lives, and Ivan, who ended up training at a tennis academy in Italy, went on to become an extremely accomplished player. He never made it into the same tennis stratosphere as Edberg, a winner of six singles majors, but he reached world No.3, played in a Grand Slam semifinal at Roland Garros and propelled Croatia to a Davis Cup triumph.\n\nOne of the most popular figures in tennis, he has become known for his intelligence; Federer once described his friend as \"very bright\" and \"a natural leader\".\n\nOff the court, Ljubicic has been an extremely influential figure. In addition to having served on the ATP Player Council, he was on the ATP Board of Directors, which no other active player had done for the best part of 20 years.\n\nThere has been top-level coaching experience, too, as, until last month, Ljubicic was working with Milos Raonic. The highlight of their time together saw the Canadian make the Wimbledon semifinals in 2014 before his path was blocked by a certain Mr Federer.\n\nReflecting on their collaboration, Raonic spoke of Ljubicic's \"tremendous amount of support, knowledge and understanding\".\n\nSince his retirement as a player, Ljubicic has stayed connected with the sport, his other commitments including managing Tomas Berdych and television commentary stints.\n\nHe is a physically imposing man -- with his 6-foot-4 frame and his shaved head, some have suggested that he looks more like a nightclub bouncer than a former tennis player -- but is much more brains than brawn, and will bring no little thought to his adventures with Federer.\n\nStefan Edberg brought an attacking dimension to Roger Federer's game. Aurelien Meunier/Getty Images\n\nLjubicic will have a very tough act to follow, however. Edberg was always Federer's hero and guided him to three Grand Slam finals during their partnership: Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015, and this year's U.S. Open.\n\nThere is no doubt that Edberg transformed Federer after his distressing 2013, when he lost in Wimbledon's second round and some outside the camp started to use the r-word: retirement.\n\nThis year, only Novak Djokovic stopped Federer from adding to his collection of 17 Slams, with the Serbian beating him in the London and New York major finals.\n\nFederer's adoration of Edberg smoothed their player-coach relationship; there was already a base. Their relationship only came to an end, they both said, because it had never been designed as a long-term partnership.\n\nThis time, with the Swiss' new coach, there is a friendship in place before work has started. And Ljubicic will know Federer's game from their 16 matches on the Tour (of which he won just three) as well as their time practising together when they were both competing.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether Federer will continue to be as aggressive with Ljubicic as he was with Edberg. During the Edberg era, Federer attacked the net more than he had done in years.\n\nLjubicic was fundamentally a baseliner, who only made rare excursions to the net. But whatever direction Ljubicic takes Federer in next year, he won't do so without first putting a great deal of thought into it.", "Gus Bradley will return as Jacksonville Jaguars coach for 2016 season": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jaguars owner Shad Khan has gone through five head coaches in two years with the London soccer team he owns, but he's sticking with just one in Jacksonville -- for now.\n\nKhan announced Tuesday afternoon that he is bringing Gus Bradley back for at least one more season, though Bradley will face much higher expectations in 2016, which is the final year of his contract.\n\n\"I spoke to Gus Bradley today to confirm to him that he will continue as head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2016. It's evident to see how far we've come in many aspects of our game, and Gus deserves a lot of credit for that progress,\" Khan said in a statement. \"It's also evident the considerable work that remains to be done to be where we expect to be at this time next season, which is well above where we stand today. And Gus understands that. [General manager] Dave Caldwell and I also spoke today and we are both confident that Gus will make 2016 the best year of his career. In the meantime, I expect his coaching staff and team to respond favorably to this news in preparation for Houston on Sunday and then begin thinking about what more they can provide next season. We have high ambitions.\"\n\nGus Bradley will be back as Jaguars head coach for the 2016 season. Wesley Hitt/Getty Images\n\nBradley and Caldwell were both hired in 2013 and tasked with rebuilding one of the NFL's worst franchises. The Jaguars hadn't made the playoffs since 2007, which was also the last time they had a winning record.\n\nBradley won four games in 2013 and three in 2014, and 19 of the 25 losses in those two season were by double digits -- including the first eight games in 2013.\n\nThings have slowly improved, and the Jaguars have been more competitive in 2015. They are 5-10 heading into the season finale at Houston but have only four losses by double digits. Two of those losses are to Carolina and New England.\n\nThings certainly look bright on the offensive side with a young core of players that includes quarterback Blake Bortles, receivers Allen Hurns and Allen Robinson, running back T.J. Yeldon, and tight end Julius Thomas. Bortles has already set the franchise's single-season record for touchdown passes (35 and counting) and needs just 179 yards to set the single-season franchise record for passing yards (currently 4,367). Hurns (10 TDs) and Robinson (NFL-high 14 TDs) have both surpassed 1,000 yards receiving, the first time that's happened since Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell in 2001.\n\nThe defense, however, has been a problem, especially this season. The Jaguars are on pace to give up the second-most points in franchise history and three of the top five worst scoring defenses in team history have come under Bradley, who helped build Seattle's defense into one of the NFL's best.\n\nThings weren't helped by the fact that first-round pick Dante Fowler Jr. suffered a torn ACL in rookie minicamp and defensive tackle Sen'Derrick Marks, the team's best defensive player and an effective interior pass rusher, played in only four games. He didn't play in the first six because he was coming back from a torn ACL he suffered in the 2014 season finale and was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 18 after suffering a torn triceps against Baltimore.\n\nThe Jaguars' plan is to concentrate on the defense in free agency and the 2016 draft, especially at pass rusher, safety and cornerback.\n\nKhan didn't give an indication in his statement what his exact expectations are for Bradley and the franchise in 2016, but it's logical to infer that a winning record would qualify as \"well above where we stand today.\"\n\nThat might be hard to do considering the work that must be done on defense and the fact that it's unlikely the AFC South would be as much of a mess as it was in 2015. Indianapolis lost quarterback Andrew Luck for much of the season, and backups Matt Hasselbeck and Charlie Whitehurst have also been hurt. Tennessee started a rookie quarterback in Marcus Mariota who showed flashes that he could be headed for a bright career. Houston has started four quarterbacks because of injuries.", "New England Patriots' Tom Brady expresses support for Peyton Manning": "ESPN's Ian Fitzsimmons and Mike Golic discuss Broncos QB Peyton Manning denying reports of receiving HGH in 2011 and if they believe the findings are valid. (1:20)\n\nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady expressed support and personal admiration for Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning in the wake of Manning being identified in an Al Jazeera report as one of several high-profile athletes who were supplied performance-enhancing drugs from an anti-aging clinic.\n\n\"I would consider him a good friend and you hate to see your good friends go through anything like that,\" Brady said during his weekly interview on sports radio WEEI on Monday morning.\n\n\"He\u2019s been a great player for this league, for his teams, for his organizations. He\u2019s been one of the best players to ever play the game. Nobody has more respect for Peyton than I do, and everything he\u2019s accomplished. Those are always challenging times, but he\u2019s a tough guy, I know that. He\u2019s a very mentally and physically tough guy.\"\n\nBrady, who went through his own high-profile situation in the offseason with the NFL taking him to court over air pressure in footballs, was asked by hosts John Dennis, Andy Hart and Steve Buckley if he would consider reaching out to Manning based on his own experience.\n\n\"He\u2019s a big boy. He knows how to handle these things. Like I said, he\u2019s a very mentally tough guy,\" Brady answered.\n\n\"There is nothing I really want to add, because I don\u2019t know; someone writes a story and to comment on the story that someone writes all the time, I don\u2019t know the details of anything,\" Brady continued.\n\n\"I fully support Peyton and my friendship with him over the years. He\u2019s a guy that I can always count on and he\u2019s been someone who has always been so supportive of me. We\u2019ll have lifelong friendships. Truthfully, I don\u2019t put much into anything.

I wanted to do my job and do my job well and get into the playoffs and have a big season so he could continue to be the head coach. I have such respect for him. He's the only coach I've had in the NFL, and in that sense, I feel disappointed that I wasn't able to play at a better level for him.\"\n\nTold that some of his players, including Manning, feel as though they've let him down, Coughlin said he hoped that would stop.\n\n\"I feel badly that they feel that way,\" Coughlin said. \"It's a shame they have to be put in the position where they have to respond to something to do with me.

I am confident with the character, the leadership, the talent that we have that exists on that team now that we will be able to have the run.\"\n\nBrees, who turns 37 next month, is due $20 million in salary and bonuses in 2016, the final year of his contract. His salary-cap figure will be $30 million, the highest for any player since at least 2002, according to ESPN Stats & Information. That makes it likely the Saints will pursue a contract extension with Brees to lower his 2016 cap number -- especially because they're already over the projected salary cap of $150 million for next year with just 41 players under contract.\n\nIf the Saints were to trade or release Brees, they would have to do it by Feb. 10, when $10.85 million of his salary becomes fully guaranteed.\n\nPayton has two years remaining on his contract, but other teams are expected to inquire about whether he might be available next week.\n\nDuring Tuesday's interview with NFL Network, Brees also offered support for NFC South rival Cam Newton's MVP candidacy.\n\n\"I absolutely [believe he deserves it].

Even worse, he'd lost the joy of running.\n\nAfter a disappointing 2:28:54 in his marathon debut -- at the 2014 New York City Marathon -- he'd had enough. He walked away for more than two months, gained 23 pounds on his 6-foot-4 frame and had no desire to get back. His contract with the Oregon Project expired and wasn't renewed.\n\nNewly married and with a daughter on the way, Puskedra questioned whether all the work he'd put in -- he calls himself an \"all-or-nothing\" personality who does nothing halfway -- and all the time away from home had any meaning. He'd thrown everything he had into running and, in his eyes, fallen flat.\n\n\"When you don't race well, it's hard not to look back and say, 'I sacrificed all this stuff and it wasn't worth it,'\" Puskedra says.\n\nHe started looking at various jobs and thinking he wanted to be a \"normal guy\" who didn't eat, sleep and breathe running.\n\n\"I didn't have that desire,\" he says. \"I just didn't see it.

He's again a happy, dedicated runner. And, on Feb. 13, he'll be among the favorites to win a spot on the U.S. team at the U.S. Olympic marathon trials in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's probably one of the bigger transformations I've seen in a runner, going from kind of down and out to being the top U.S. marathoner,\" says Andy Powell, his distance coach at Oregon and a friend and mentor. \"It was pretty cool to see.\"\n\nRegaining his stride\n\nPuskedra's running renaissance was gradual. It came with the help of a move, his wife, Powell, the Olympic calendar and a change in approach.\n\nLuke and Trudie moved from Portland, Oregon, where he'd been training with the Oregon Project, back to Eugene, where she took a job as a tennis coach. At the time, Luke felt he was closing a door. Instead, it turned out he was opening one.\n\nBack in Eugene, he was closer to Powell and felt more at ease. Powell hadn't been his coach since Luke left Oregon, but the two had stayed in touch. Now that Puskedra was back, Powell -- the man who recruited him to Eugene -- invited him to Ducks practices.\n\nLuke Puskedra, far left, reconnected with the running world when he returned to Oregon, where he was a track and cross country star. Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\n\"Andy told him, 'Just come down to practice. You don't have to run with the guys or anything, just come and hang out,' to get a little social interaction,\" recalls Trudie. \"He started running with the guys. He definitely wasn't, 'I'm going to run again.' It was slowly. You kind of let the wounds heal and your confidence builds back up.\"\n\nPowell says his invitation to Luke Puskedra wasn't anything \"structured.\" Puskedra came out, watched workouts, chatted and soaked up the college vibe.\n\n\"I told him, 'Don't take running too seriously, but don't completely make up your mind and just throw in the towel,'\" says Powell. He told Puskedra to just run for fun and invited him to occasionally work out with the team.\n\nAt first, \"he was the worst one of the group,\" says Powell, laughing. He was out of shape. \"Slowly, over time, he got better. I was just giving him the opportunity to be around our guys and go for runs and ... something sparked.\"\n\nPuskedra says it was \"a long process.\" It wasn't really until April, when he entered the Vancouver Sun Run 10K and won in 28:53, that he felt as if he were on the right track. It wasn't a big race. The field wasn't stacked with elite runners. Yet he was energized by the atmosphere, his performance and the presence of several members of Trudie's family who regularly participate in the event. He had fun.\n\nAs spring turned into summer, his training with Powell increased and he began to regain his fitness and passion. The fact it is a pre-Olympic year was a motivator.\n\n\"Making the Olympic team was always my dream, and so it was kind of us sitting down and having the talk, it's like it would be stupid go give it up and then a year from now say, 'OK, yeah I want to run again,'\" he says. \"'OK, you've got to wait another three years for the Olympic trials.'\n\n\"That was what I'm trying to work towards. When I started training again, like I said, I'm all-or-nothing with everything. I was like, 'OK, I'm going to do everything I can to make that Olympic team.'\"\n\nAll the while, Puskedra was intent on keeping a better balance in his life. Running would no longer overpower everything else, especially once Trudie gave birth to their daughter, Penelope, in July. He vowed that family would be a priority. He cites Meb Keflezighi and Dathan Ritzenhein, both stars in the running world and devoted family men, as role models.\n\n\"But I don't think it's a secret that when they show up to the line they're ready to go every time,\" he says.\n\nSo Puskedra streamlined his workouts. Less was more. Instead of stressing about working additional stretching, core work and weights into his routine, he ditched them. He focused only on running. His intent was to gradually work those back in, but as of late November he said he hadn't.\n\n\"I've been able to have the success without them ... I just felt I've got a good balance,\" he says.\n\nPowell, too, could see it, especially after Penelope arrived.\n\n\"He was just genuinely really happy,\" he says. \"And I think being happy is a big part of running, you know? If you're not happy, you're not going to be successful. I think he got into this good routine and he just seems to be doing great.\"\n\nManaging stress\n\nIn June, Powell suggested Puskedra run Grandma's Marathon in Minnesota. He did, and ran 2:15:27. Trudie says she could see a difference in him.\n\n\"It was just a nice, easy pace for him,\" she says. \"After that everything just started picking up and he felt better and better.\"\n\nEditor's Picks Competitor: Linden's strong season, trials buildup Desiree Linden finished fourth at the Boston Marathon and more success followed over the summer. Now she's prepping in earnest for the U.S Olympic trials and possible redemption in Rio.\n\nIn early September, he finished fourth in the USA Track and Field 20K championship in Connecticut, running 59:30, just three seconds behind Ritzenhein in third place, and six seconds behind winner Jared Ward.\n\nWith the Chicago Marathon just weeks away, Puskedra started thinking about entering. Though he wasn't doing the usual structured marathon training, he was eager to test himself. Almost every day Trudie says her husband would say, \"I think I want to run Chicago.\"\n\n\"One day I was like, 'You know what, just run Chicago,'\" she recalls. \"I told him, 'You're at a point in your career where nothing really matters. Nobody really expects anything from you anymore. Not in a bad way, you're just now the underdog.'\"\n\nSo, Puskedra called the race director three weeks before the race date, was granted a spot and surprised almost everyone with his performance. Powell, however, wasn't among the surprised.\n\n\"He was doing some incredible things in practice,\" he says. \"He just kind of had to put it together and get in the right race. I've seen him in good shape when he was in college, but the stuff he was doing before Chicago, he looked really good.\"\n\nPuskedra says his own expectations for the race were low. He simply hoped for a good marathon experience. But halfway through, he found himself in the lead pack at a pace that was perfect for him. When the leaders took off with 10K remaining, he couldn't catch them. Yet he felt good and stayed strong, finishing fifth as the top American.\n\nIt was an entirely different experience from his marathon debut in New York almost a year earlier, when he says he'd stressed himself out thinking of every possible scenario that could go wrong, and did.\n\n\"I guess the biggest difference was I obsessed about that marathon for 16 weeks before, and that was the result,\" he says. \"And this one, I only gave myself three weeks to obsess about it and I didn't really obsess.\"\n\nNow, he's back into a more traditional marathon training routine, building up for the Olympic trials. And, in just over 2 hours and 10 minutes in Chicago, he restored all those high expectations. Now, too, he has a new deal with Nike. He's back in the mainstream.\n\nThis time, he believes he's ready.\n\n\"I feel good,\" he says. \"I think the biggest thing for me is to not stress. It's managing it.\"\n\nPowell, too, believes he's primed. He thinks he has a good shot at making the Olympic team.\n\nWhether he does or not, though, Powell sees big things in the long run for Puskedra in the marathon. He believes the two years Puskedra put in with Salazar - building a strong base - are paying off. At 25, he's still got a big upside. Plus, he says Puskedra's ability to do high mileage yet stay healthy is rare.\n\n\"All of a sudden, things are starting to click,\" he says. \"He's in a good spot now for sure.\"", "Two books highlight early Olympic success stories": "Looking for a holiday gift for someone with an interest in the Olympics? Here are two new books to consider: \"The Three-Year Swim Club\" by Julie Checkoway and \"Speed Kings\" by Andy Bull.\n\nLike the wonderful and highly successful \"Unbroken\" by Laura Hillenbrand and \"The Boys in the Boat\" by Daniel James Brown, these books focus on Olympic athletes and their aspirations from the Depression and World War II era. \"The Three Year Swim Club\" examines the rise of swimmers in Hawaii who overcame such poor circumstances that many of them began swimming in irrigation ditches near a Maui sugar plantation. The gold-medal bobsledders from the 1932 Olympics in Lake Placid in \"Speed Kings\" generally had a tad more money -- several were part of the upper-class society at the time, wealthy enough to vacation in St. Moritz.\n\nBoth books are exceptionally well-researched and well-written accounts of long-forgotten and perhaps never known sporting success. In \"Swim Club,\" we learn much about gold medalist Duke Paoa Kahanamoku and his role in Hawaiian swimming, the horrible working conditions on the sugar plantations where many of the swimmers grew up, and the incredible coaching of Soichi Sakamoto. He had little swimming experience -- when he swam to earn Eagle Scout status, the examiner called it the most pathetic performance he had ever seen -- yet still trained 15 national champions, including future gold medalist Bill Smith. The Maui coach pushed his athletes with the club's motto of \"Olympics First and Olympics Always.\"\n\nUnfortunately, \"Olympics Always\" was not the case due to WWII. One of the most interesting parts of \"Swim Club\" is the tale of how Japan was awarded host city for both the 1940 Winter and Summer Olympics, both of which were cancelled due to World War II. The cancellation of the 1940 and 1944 Games cost some Swim Club athletes their Olympic medal chances.\n\n\"Speed Kings\" occasionally ranges too far in its scope, with much background on peripheral and supporting characters, such as actress/dancer Mae Murray and Melvil Dewey, the founder of the Dewey Decimal system. Still, almost all the stories -- even the peripheral ones -- are captivating, particularly that of Eddie Eagan, a light heavyweight boxer and student at Harvard and Oxford who remains the only athlete to ever win gold in the Summer (1920) and Winter Olympics (1932). Other intriguing tales are how bobsledding started and evolved, how Lake Placid was able to get the 1932 Olympics (and which were nearly ruined by warm weather) and just who gold medal bobsledder Clifford Tippy Gray really was.\n\nThe person who receives the most pages in \"Speed Kings\" is U.S. sled driver Billy Fiske, who won his first gold medal at age 16 in the 1928 Winter Olympics and won his second in 1932. Unfortunately, he reportedly become the first American killed in WWII, albeit while flying in the British RAF before the U.S. had even entered the war.\n\nEither of these books will make a nice holiday gift. Just be sure not to tear the cover, bend the spine or stain the pages while you read them before giving them away.", "Luke Campbell and Mitchell Smith have learned that boxing is about hurt, not hype": "It is rare that a genuine prospect gets beat when he is meant to win, but this month this has happened to two of Britain's very best young fighters.\n\nIn both cases the boxers were not overmatched, or thrown into a risky fight that had some type of genuine benefit. Both were hefty favourites with the bookies and both had big fights planned.\n\nAt the O2 in London on December 12, Luke Campbell was dropped heavily and beaten over 12 rounds by Frenchman Yvan Mendy. Campbell, who won Olympic gold in 2012, was unbeaten in 12 with 10 knockouts and, during the last year, has been declared the best lightweight in Britain; a super champ in waiting.\n\nThe truth is that the people in charge of him -- and some easily influenced so-called boxing experts -- considered that he was a better fight than the British lightweight world champions Terry Flanagan and Ant Crolla, and far in advance of the British lightweight contenders Kevin Mitchell, Derry Mathews and even the British champion at the weight, Scott Cardle. He was our new Jim Watt, the lightweight hero for the future.\n\nCampbell, you see, had sold out venues in his hometown of Hull, had thrilled the crowds with fights and smiled each time the cameras settled on him. Nobody told him that the business gets harder.\n\nHe found out when the bell sounded against Mendy. Campbell also found out that praise is not an asset once a man refuses to fall over in the ring, and that no amount of expectation and wild predictions can help a fighter when it gets tough inside the ropes. In defeat, Campbell showed that he has guts and that will, trust me, help him in the future.\n\nMitchell Smith was previously unbeaten Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nAt the Manchester Arena last Saturday, Mitchell Smith, who narrowly pipped Campbell to become the British boxing writers' young boxer of the year, was given a serious lesson in humility, preparation and old-fashioned skill by a man called George Jupp.\n\nSmith had started to believe his publicity and, during a bad-tempered week before the fight, had verbally abused his opponent and his opponent's seasoned and decent trainer, Derek Grainger. I have to say that Jupp and Grainger handled the nonsense with dignity and class. I was a bit disappointed with Smith and I was not alone in looking at his skin colour and body tone and thinking that perhaps he had cut a few corners during the preparation for the fight. I was probably right.\n\nJupp was picked to lose, picked to make Smith, who was unbeaten in 13, look good before a massive announcement. Jupp refused to lose and he and Grainger worked to a plan; Smith was outpointed over 10 rounds and deserved to lose. Grainger, by the way, once went unbeaten in 18 fights before getting his own reality check one night at the Royal Albert Hall in 1991. The defeat could make Smith the fighter that he started to think he was, but it will not be easy.\n\nJupp and Mendy offer a dark warning to Britain's hundreds of unbeaten and untested young fighters that no amount of publicity, careful matchmaking and ticket sales can protect you in a real fight.\n\nIt's the hurt business, not the hype business.\n\nBuncey's Vaults\n\n'That is my life: sex and fighting,' said Vinny Pazienza (left) Mark Thompson/Allsport via Getty Images\n\nVinny Pazienza was in London to fight Herol 'Bomber' Graham and the extrovert former world champion was in fine form and contemplating a career in the adult film industry.\n\n\"Pazienza says that he has invited his \"friends from the industry\" to London for the contest and the guest list for his private party afterwards reads like a business-card display in a West End telephone box.\"\n\nPazienza had survived a car crash to defy the odds and walk and fight again. \"'I knew that if I could have sex with a girlfriend, I would fight, because I need to do both. That is my life: sex and fighting,' said Pazienza.\"\n\n\"For Saturday's contest against Graham, he has settled for a poster which shows him holding the severed heads of two women.\" He had previously walked naked through a graveyard to help sell a fight.\n\nGraham was the underdog at Wembley in the fight and Pazienza had lost only to Roy Jones in his previous 13 fights. On the night, however, Graham gave him a boxing lesson and won every round.\n\nAs reported in the Daily Telegraph on December 4, 1997", "Novak Djokovic the undisputed men's player of the year": "It is again time to hand out our year-end awards. Today, we look at the men's player of the year, but click here to check out the rest of our list.\n\nIt's no secret Novak Djokovic strung together one of the finest seasons in ATP history.\n\nHe dominated so much so that he has no competition for the 2015 men's player of the year award. We can only enumerate his vast accomplishments. He collected 11 titles and reached the final in 15 of 16 events -- all except his first of the season. Among the highlights, Djokovic won three Grand Slam titles and reached the final at Roland Garros, He also captured six of the nine Masters titles and won the ATP Tour Finals trophy. Thanks partly to large prize-money increases at these events, he collected a record $21 million in winnings.\n\nDjokovic not only finished the year ranked No. 1 but nearly lapped No. 2 Andy Murray in rankings points. Just about the only thing Djokovic did not accomplish this season was to complete the career Slam by winning the French Open, where he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the championship match.\n\nNovak Djokovic won three majors, six Masters and the year-end championships in 2015. Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images\n\nDjokovic finished with a record of 82-6, with three of those losses coming against Roger Federer.\n\nThe Serb's season was so good, the question isn't whether it was the best season of the year -- it's whether it was the best season of any year. Only Federer in 2006 (92-5), John McEnroe in 1984 (82-3) and Jimmy Connors in 1974 (93-4) had better winning percentages in a single season.\n\nThat Djokovic had a career year is saying something considering he had already assembled an all-time great season in 2011, when he dropped just two matches through the US Open in September, while winning three Grand Slams along the way. But he injured himself in the Davis Cup semifinals and couldn't quite regain his momentum for the fall swing.\n\nThis year, Djokovic went 19-1 after New York, and the one match he lost came in the round-robin stage of the ATP World Tour Finals -- a tournament he won.\n\n\"I can't say I expected it, not at all,\" Djokovic said to the press at the year-end championships. \"But I always gave my best, and I'm always asking from myself the most. I was always hoping that I can play this well throughout the entire season.\n\n\"Again, I've played maybe the best tennis of the season in China. I played great on clay, as well. Overall it's been as close to perfection as it can get, the season. Just blessed and overwhelmed with the emotion and the thrill to be achieving such a great season. It inspires me even more to keep on going.\"\n\nDespite all of Djokovic's achievements, they were somewhat downplayed compared to Rafael Nadal's inconsistent season and Federer's enduring presence. But now, it's apparent that Djokovic's career is approaching theirs. With a total of 10 Grand Slam titles, he is now seven behind Federer and only four behind Nadal, but the world No. 1 has accrued more weeks at No. 1 than the Spaniard (176-141).\n\nFrom this point on, Djokovic will not only be playing his legendary rivals for trophies but for space in the history books as well.", "Beer Mile record-setter Lewis Kent signs shoe deal with Brooks": "The Beer Mile World Classic in San Francisco featured the greatest field the sport has ever gathered. Four beers and one mile later, Canadian Lewis Kent emerged as the champion. ESPN's Greg Garber reports. (2:41)\n\nLewis Kent may never become a professional runner, but the 22-year-old student at the University of Western Ontario -- and \"beer mile\" record holder -- has signed a shoe and apparel deal with Brooks.\n\nIt is believed to be the first mainstream sponsorship for the sport, in which participants must drink four beers over the course of a 1-mile run. After Kent broke his own record for the beer mile (4 minutes, 51 seconds) on Tuesday night, he announced that he had signed with Brooks.\n\n\"It's pretty surreal,\" Kent said Wednesday. \"I've always liked to run and drink beer, but I never thought I would be considered world class for doing both.\"\n\n\"It's pretty surreal. I've always liked to run and drink beer, but I never thought I would be considered world class for doing both.\" Lewis Kent\n\nJenine Lafayette, marketing manager for Brooks Canada, would not disclose the terms of the two-year deal with Kent, other than to say the deal will pay him \"more than we would pay an amateur athlete and less than we would pay an Olympian.\" The deal does include bonuses should he win some of the big events on the beer mile calendar, she said.\n\nKent, who is on the Western Ontario track team, has a personal mile record (without beer) of 4:15. The fact that it takes him only an additional 36 seconds to tackle the beer mile makes him world class. Olympian Nick Symmonds, for example, has a personal beer mile record of 5:19.\n\nAfter setting a then-record beer mile of 4:55 at the Beer Mile World Classic in San Francisco in August, Kent contacted Montreal-based sports marketing agent Kris Mychasiw, who set up a meeting with Brooks. Kent bested that record on Tuesday, running by himself on a high school track in London, Ontario.\n\n\"I think, over the past couple of years, the beer mile has gone from something collegiate runners did to something more serious,\" Mychasiw said. \"And there's a lot [of] appeal to the guys who can who can do this.\"\n\nLafayette said that Brooks had been watching the beer mile revolution for a couple of years and was looking for a way to dip its toe in the event.\n\n\"We heard about Lewis and how he wanted to use the beer mile to put Canada on the map,\" Lafayette said. \"We feel like our brand zigs when others zag and while our competitors might be all about the sweat and tears of the run, we're about the pursuit of happiness along the way.\"\n\nAlthough Kent received no prize money for winning the Beer Mile World Classic, that could change in the future, given the attention the beer mile has received.\n\nLast year, online streaming company FloTrack provided nearly $250,000 in funds and resources to host the Beer Mile World Championships, which will take place again in Austin, Texas, on Dec. 1. The winners take home $2,500, and $5,000 for a world record.\n\nMark Floreani, chief operating officer of FloSports, which owns FloTrack, said the company invested in the beer mile because of the traction that it got from people outside the running community.\n\n\"There's a lot of interest in the beer mile,\" said Floreani.\n\nFloTrack has also helped in establishing the official rules for the beer mile. Runners drink a 12-ounce beer (which cannot be light and must be a minimum 5 percent alcohol) every quarter of a mile. The beer must be consumed within a 10-meter zone before the start of each lap. Penalty laps are added on for runners who throw up.\n\nWhen Kent graduates this year, he plans to attend postgraduate school to pursue a career in physical therapy, but if the interest in the beer mile continues to gain steam, there's a shot he could make a career out of it, similar to the opportunities for top competitive eaters.\n\nOn Tuesday night, hours after Kent set the record, Amsterdam Beer, the Toronto-based brew that is Kent's beer of choice, retweeted the YouTube clip of Kent's run. Mychasiw said that could be another potential sponsorship.", "Elisa Desco Interview: Trail Running\u2019s Persona Non Grata Speaks Out": "We caught up with Italian trail runner Elisa Desco to ask questions about her failed doping test in 2009 and the resistance she faced at The North Face Endurance Challenge 50-mile championship on Dec. 5 near San Francisco. The intent to publish this interview is not to suggest Elisa Desco is innocent or whether she should be allowed to compete, but merely to further the conversation about the current issues and unknowns facing trail running and ultrarunning. [Note: This story has been updated to correctly identify the name of the therapeutic cream Desco says was applied to her body as Voltaren.]\n\nThere\u2019s a growing movement among race bureaucracies, athletes and media to call for lifetime bans for athletes who are caught using performance-enhancing drugs. It\u2019s easy to cast off a rule-breaker as someone who disrespected the sport. Hammering a runner personally from behind a keyboard with self-righteous indignation might feel good, but there is often more than just the apparent facts of a particular case.\n\nAny amount of false-positive tests would serve to undermine the entire system of drug testing. As such, doping-control protocols are designed to find those athletes who reach a 99.9 percent likelihood of PED use. This leaves a lot of suspicious tests unflagged and unreported\u2014as was evident in the IAAF leaked test results which showed out of 12,000 blood tests from 5,000 athletes between 2001 and 2012, 800 tests were \u201chighly suggestive of doping or at the very least abnormal,\u201d but were ultimately found negative for PEDs.\n\nOnly 1 percent of worldwide samples tested are found positive. It\u2019s with this in mind that I interviewed Elisa Desco, who failed a drug test in 2009 for EPO, served a two-year ban from the IAAF and has claimed her innocence ever since. (She has been eligible to compete since Aug. 28, 2012, when her IAAF ban ended and has competed in numerous races since then, including several high-level trail races this year.) Her entry in The North Face Endurance Challenge 50-miler in California on Dec. 5\u2014which had a $30,000 prize purse (one of the largest in trail running), including $10,000 for the winners\u2014forced the international ultrarunning community into a mostly productive, but sometimes vitriolic, discussion.\n\nUltimately, the online chatter, other media stories (including those about Lance Armstrong winning a trail race) and this interview all suggest that trail running is at a crossroads as more money and professional runners enter the sport, especially given that there are few races that test athletes and few races that have specific policies about doping or convicted dopers.\n\nIn reporting on ultrarunning\u2019s growing need for testing, I reached out to Desco for an interview, but was unable to speak to her before that article was published on Dec. 9. After that story went live on Competitor.com, her partner, five-time world mountain running champion Marco De Gasperi, emailed me to say she\u2019d be willing to talk. Since we don\u2019t share a common language, the following interview was done in two parts over email. The interview is published below, edited only where necessary for optimally coherent translation.\n\nYou are an accomplished international athlete, but for our readers who might not know you, please tell us a bit of your background: Where were you born?\n\nI [was] born in Savigliano in [the] province of Cuneo, in the northern west Italy, on the France border.\n\nWhere did you grow up?\n\nI lived until when I was 25 with my parents and my brother in Paesana, a small village down the shadow of Monviso, a beautiful mountain, the highest of this part of the Italian Alps.\n\nWhen did you start running?\n\nI started running at the age of 12, following my father and brother who were passionate about this sport. I didn\u2019t like it the first time, but I remember this passion grew in [a] few months and I [have] never stop[ped].\n\nAre you a full-time athlete or do you also have another profession?\n\nI consider myself not a professional runner, but first of all a mother. This is my profession, maybe even a housekeeper. Then, eventually, a professional runner.\n\nWhen were you and Marco married?\n\nWe haven\u2019t gotten married yet. We have lived together about eight years in our house [in] Bormio, Italy.\n\nHow many children do you have and what are their ages?\n\nWe have only one daughter, Lidia, born in 2010. She is our little angel!!\n\nWas running always your primary sport growing up?\n\nYes, I can consider running the only sport I\u2019ve done in my life. I believe I\u2019m not so good in other sports, I\u2019m quite bad in riding a bike or playing volley[ball] or other sports where you need some technique, generally speaking.\n\nWhen did you realize that you had a certain aptitude for endurance sports, and running specifically?\n\nWhen I was 16, my coach at that time told me how my skill[s] were towards the longer distances even [though] I was still young. At 20 I raced my first road half marathon in 1:18:30 without too many specific trainings because I was only a mountain runner.\n\nWho are your main sponsors?\n\nScott, Compressport, Agisko and Nortec.\n\nWhich win do you consider your favorite?\n\nSierre Zinal 2013. [It is] one of the most iconic mountain running race in the Alps.\n\nYou won the won the 2009 World Mountain Running Championship in Campodolcino, Italy. Can you describe for us what happened after the race?\n\nThe same things [that] happen after an important victory. The incredible happiness after an unexpected victory, and the referee after the finish line [had me] sign the sheet for the anti-doping control. I remember I was the only one among the three of us tested, that the referee led me straight to the bar where the test took place.The others stayed outside with their referees for [a] longer [period of] time.\n\nCan you take us through the drug-testing procedure?\n\nThe test is quite simple. First of all you need to fill in your dates [on] the sheet for the procedure. Then you have to choose a box with two separated glass jars. Then you take another plastic glass for the urine. When ready (I drank about 700ml of water before it), you can try to fill it up until the minimum requested (about 100ml) under the check of a doctor in the bathroom. Then, when it\u2019s done, you can be helped by the doctor to share [the urine] in the two jars that must be closed with the special cap by you. Then [both jars are] introduced into the same box and the procedure ends with filling the sheet with the numbers impressed on the jars, the caps, and the box, which must be the same one. You must declare the medicine you took in the last few days eventually and fill in if everything in the control went OK.\n\nDescribe when you eventually heard that you failed the test?\n\nI remember exactly that day, it was October, one month after the race in Campodolcino. I was at home, waiting for a call from the Italian federation for the details of the flight I would have had to take two days later for the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Birmingham (Great Britain). The mobile phone rang that early afternoon and a person at the other end told me I had failed an anti-doping test. I tested positive to a substance called CERA. I just watched the number on the mobile because I guessed someone was just kidding me, but I recognized the number was from Rome\u2014from the Italian athletic federation! This person (from the health federation) said to me I could make a paper airplane with the air ticket to the race.\n\nI was so shocked and immediately I called Marco. I was about 400K far away and when I reached him, he sat on the ground. We had heard about this heavy substance that summer from some cyclist scandals during the Tour de France, but we really didn\u2019t know more about it. I felt totally empty and disoriented. I called my parents and some friends to tell them the shocking news, while Marco was driving back home and calling someone to understand better what happened. When he arrived at home, I was crying. I just had a chat with the president of my club, who didn\u2019t believe my try to explain my incredulity and innocence in the situation! Marco\u2019s face was disoriented. He got the information for this substance [and] I should have had to make at least an injection. I remembered, one month before the race I needed to go to the first aid at the hospital to make an injection of an antihistaminic due to a strong allergy on a leg to the Diclofenac present in a cream (Voltaren) the physiotherapist had used on my leg without asking me if I was subject to any allergies. We discovered after[ward] that antihistaminic cannot be related (or polluted, eventually) in any case to the CERA.\n\n\n\nHave you ever used the banned substance erythropoietin?\n\nNEVER used it, but even NEVER thought about it! I will declare my innocence until the end of my days!! The investigators (the Carabinieri in Italy) put my contacts (emails and mobile) under control for two years before and after [the test]. NOTHING was found that could be used against me to prove I got prohibited substances from anyone! I guess for heavy substances like this, some traces would have to be found\u2014we are not talking about something you can buy in a store! Isn\u2019t this something strange?\n\nHave you ever used any banned substances?\n\nNEVER in my life. This is so far away from my lifestyle and the love for my sport!\n\nRELATED: Ultrarunning at a Crossroads: Is There a Growing Doping Problem on the Trails?\n\nHow do you explain the failed test after the 2009 Campodolcino World Championship?\n\nI cannot say I\u2019m guilty. I never cheated in 2009 or anytime! So, I went to all the hearings, after the positivity of the \u201cB\u201d sample, one month after, to say my version of the fact. There was something strange on the receipt of the box with the samples in Rome. On the sheet was written the box was damaged. Always in the report I got from the laboratory it\u2019s written one of the samples belonged to another athlete (unknown, because there are only numbers impressed on) [and] couldn\u2019t have been tested because the urine in the sample were not enough. This is also strange. Athlete is not allowed to get out the anti-doping test before you fill up the minimum requested! The anti-doping commission said to me this was not a problem of mine. They attacked me for the substance [that] was present (in a very huge quantity) in my urine. The scientific protocol for the CERA never fails in this case, even because they have had a double-check from another laboratory in Paris.\n\nHow did you attempt to redeem yourself and fight the charges?\n\nIt was a long fight, without any money from the start, but with the great motivation of someone who doesn\u2019t want to accept to be killed for something [they] have never done! We found an important doctor representing the anti-doping laboratory in Firenze called Giuseppe Pieraccini. He listen[ed] to us, and accepted to try to follow-up [in] person the check on the B sample in Rome. He accept[ed] after Marco\u2019s explanation of this case. He said he did it only because he is sure we could have nothing to do with the CERA. This is too big for us. Then we chose a good lawyer [who is an] expert in doping cases. He always told us, \u201cplease confess it before the commission could prove by some emails you are involved in this case!\u201d We always denied obviously! We have nothing to hide and what should we confess?! We even tried to ask for a DNA test. It was so hard, long, and expensive. This could have been the only chance I had to show maybe those urines weren\u2019t mine! I think mine was the only case of an athlete that have the chance to make it. Basically, because when in your conscience you know you are guilty inside yourself, there\u2019s no reason to make it! Unfortunately, this test said the urines were mine, and I realized everything was finish[ed], definitely. I was against a wall, with great evidence against myself, no more money to pay the lawyer to continue a hard battle (lasting 16 months!), and the sport could convicted me with two years (but in reality more than three because they didn\u2019t calculate the 16 months I spent self-suspended from September 2009 to February 2011 because I chose to make the DNA test!)\n\nI [have] spoken to all my friends, and they understood I did everything possible I could! It was so hard. I passed really bad times if I think about when I was banned. I never slept, and I felt in depression. My desire to know who could have [done] this to me was strongly present every day. I had to be taken to the first aid [at] nighttime by Marco (with my little baby, of course!) because [of] some heart problems. I don\u2019t wish to pass something like this to anyone!\n\nDo you still believe in the testing system?\n\nYes, I still believe in it! I don\u2019t believe in the persons. But I accepted to be in the Whereabouts program (test control at home) of the WADA before, and national now, plus in competitions (three times this year). Stories tell [us that] there could be athletes that use prohibited substances and can be negative at the test. But at least I hope it will never happen [to] the contrary anymore, this that happened to me! In addition, [after] talking to a doctor, I decided to build up a biologic[al] passport with blood exams in a hospital. Every month I check some specific parameters (such as reticulocytes) that can be shown as a strong defense if something like it happened in the past to me. My opinion is any federations must be pushing all their athletes to do it. It\u2019s simple, not expensive at all, and everyone can show their test to the federation medical commission or to anyone.\n\nDo you think the two-year ban is appropriate in general?\n\nNo, for two reasons. In my opinion there are different substances. There are the heaviest like EPO, CERA, hormone steroids \u2026 that are worth a lifetime ban for sure, in my opinion!\n\nBut, to make this, we need to be sure 100 percent [that] the athlete is guilty! I believe my case passed way too easily just for scientific evidence. But, when you don\u2019t find from where these heavy substances came, how do you can say an athlete is 100 percent guilty? We cannot consider the corruption [that] is placed in some Federations, and interesting things have came out recently! Then there are prohibited substances (I\u2019m not a kind of specialist, but this is what I learned from some scientists involved in the anti-doping commissions and at the head of the doping fight!) that could be considered not so strong and not able to change the improvements for long time. Of course, ANYONE who uses any drugs can be considered as a cheat, but I think there are these big differences and for these I think [a] lifetime ban is too much.\n\nDo you think it was appropriate in your case specifically?\n\nWell, as I told you, if I would have to consider my case, I would have to say what happened is something crazy. If one day the truth will come out and we will discover this was somebody\u2019s incredible mistake or worse, someone who wanted to just cut me out for some unknown reasons, who will give me back my years, and all my life I spent with horrible times swimming in this shit?! What has happened to me [in the] last week before the TNF was so bad. I came back to my nightmares, and this has destroyed me again inside! I accept people can have an idea about me. They can think I\u2019m a cheat. But I paid my time, and the rules (not mine, the international rules), say I can run again. I want to be tested anytime if it\u2019s possible! But I have the right to run. If the rules are not good for some people, they can ask for a change. But using it against me wasn\u2019t fair! It would have been [a] better fight to have the anti-doping test at the end of the TNF than try to force me out of the race instead.\n\nRELATED: An Open Letter To Seb Coe: Invoke Lifetime Bans for Convicted Dopers\n\nWhen you said you still believe in the testing procedures, but \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the persons,\u201d who specifically do you mean. The doping-control agents or someone else?\n\nI think generally the agents and doctors are very professionals and I fully trust them and their work! On the other hand, I\u2019m very scared for those people who are politically involved in sport and, as recently happened, after investigations have been discovered acts of corruption.\n\nYou mentioned being treated unfairly at The North Face 50. Who treated you unfairly and what exactly happened?\n\nWell, my trip started really bad, with a strong stomach virus that bent me the night before the flight and during the over 20 hours to get there. I could not eat or drink for two days, and my first days in San Francisco I felt totally empty\u2026 then, it was not easy reading in those days my name everywhere on the social [media], where most of the people wanted me pulled out from the race!\n\nI\u2019m not really a big fan of social [media] or the U.S. media, basically because I don\u2019t speak English. But day by day, it started to appear on my timeline some articles with my face connected to the word \u201cdoping.\u201d It was shocking and it has hurt me. Then I watched the loads of comments against me, and I even started to get some private messages that invite me to stay out, because I\u2019m a cheat and nobody could accept me at the start! This never happened to me before, I was really afraid to get attacked during the race! It was such a nightmare for me, for sure this wasn\u2019t fair, because I believe to have fully (served my time). I felt worse about this issue than I did about the stomach bug.\n\nI discussed it for a long time with Marco, who was not sure he would allow me to race (for security purposes). Then, the few (but really good) American friends we have, cheered me up (and encouraged me) to start and try to not listen those bad voices. I think if I wouldn\u2019t have given myself a chance, it would have been again another injustice otherwise: the World Anti-Doping Agency is the only organization that can judge and commit sentences. The rules aren\u2019t written by me, and people can\u2019t change them after only because they don\u2019t like them.\n\nIs this why you dropped out of the race?\n\nHonestly, the virus problem, plus the stress I got, didn\u2019t put me in the best condition to run 50 miles (my first ultra) so easily. I couldn\u2019t eat and drink nearly anything, because after few miles I felt sick. At the first lights of the day, my situation got worse and worse. My legs weren\u2019t too bad, but the stomach was so bad. Plus, for the reason I couldn\u2019t drink or eat, my energy went down just after the (26-mile mark).\n\nThere were allegations after the race that people saw Marco \u201cmuling\u201d for you on the course, but that is spelled out in the rules as illegal. Did he carry anything for you outside of the aid stations? [De Gasperi, 38, was officially entered in the 50-mile championship race and ran near Desco. They recorded similar splits through the 8.7-mile mark\u20141:07:11 for De Gasperi and 1:07:14 for Desco\u2014but both runners dropped before they reached the next official split at the 44-mile mark.]\n\nWe read about this, and I am sure I can\u2019t stop their thought that Marco helped me in the race, pacing my run or carrying water, for the fact he followed my run from close.\n\nDo you think Marco came to the TNF 50 in San Francisco to help me? For those who don\u2019t know him, he\u2019s a professional runner, and even if he has never run an ultra before, he\u2019s capable to fight for a victory! He was so kind to sacrifice his run for me, when I decided to start, he wanted to be sure that nobody made me any kind of problem after those messages I got. This was my first time in the U.S. I don\u2019t speak any English, and many people promised I would have problems if I would race. Do you think I was in the best condition to run alone? We were under a microscope for sure, but those people didn\u2019t understand my fear in the race was due to this not really warm intentions! Of course, for them all of us started at the same level, it was not, try to live what I lived, first! Plus, with my stomach problems, I had to walk from the 50K to 55K when I dropped. If I were alone I would never find a way to get out of the course and go back to the finish. Thanks to Marco and the car we stopped on the road, those guys were so generous to drive us to the finish!\n\nMy final thought is races like The North Face Endurance Challenge need to have the anti-doping tests, at least for the podium finishers. The few money for this it\u2019s only an excuse, because it\u2019s enough to cut some prices and eventually add 5 dollars at the entry fee of anyone to find more money. But maybe it\u2019s easier to pull me out from the race and let people run that you never know if they run clean.\n\nRELATED: Lance Armstrong Wins 35K Trail Race, Sparking Social Media Uproar", "Brian Hoyer to start for Houston Texans if cleared to play": "HOUSTON -- Brian Hoyer, in the final stage of the concussion protocol, will be the team's starter Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars if he passes in time, Texans coach Bill O'Brien said Monday.\n\nEditor's Picks Texans quarterback carousel hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fazed DeAndre Hopkins With no continuity at quarterback, DeAndre Hopkins has reason to be frustrated.

Hoyer was the team's opening-day starter but was benched for Ryan Mallett. Hoyer regained the No. 1 role after Mallett went 1-3 in four starts, and the Texans released Mallett in the last week of October.\n\nHoyer played well until suffering a concussion against the Bengals on Nov. 16. Backup quarterback T.J. Yates entered the game and led the Texans to a 10-6 win.\n\nThat concussion caused Hoyer to miss the Texans' 24-17 win over the New York Jets. Hoyer returned the following week and started games against the Saints, Bills and Patriots. Against the Patriots on Dec. 13, Hoyer suffered his second concussion in less than a month. Yates started the following week against the Colts but suffered a torn ACL, requiring the Texans to turn to Weeden, whom they claimed off waivers Nov. 18.\n\nThe Texans want to play Brian Hoyer on Sunday against the Jaguars, but the quarterback still needs to clear the final stage of the concussion protocol. AP Photo/George Bridges\n\nAlthough Hoyer said he felt good on Thursday and traveled to Tennessee with the team, he had not cleared the league's concussion protocol.\n\nIn his absence, Weeden threw two touchdowns and ran for another, becoming the first quarterback in franchise history to do so.

Although Clowney initially reacted angrily to the injury, he later said he would be fine.\n\nO'Brien said Clowney had no structural damage to his foot.\n\n\"You don't want to be not out there with the guys, so if you have a little nick or bruise, you'll be pissed off about it,\" Clowney said. \"You just want to be out there with the guys and have fun and win games.\"", "Adoree' Jackson of USC Trojans to skip spring practice, pursue 2016 Rio Olympics in long jump": "ESPN Pac-12 reporter Kyle Bonagura discusses the impact of USC's Adoree' Jackson skipping spring practice to focus on his pursuit of qualifying for the 2016 Rio Olympics.

He makes decisions without becoming entangled in petty emotions (Is that your home planet of Alderaan, Princess Leia? Kaboom!). He has experience keeping Sith such as Vader on their leash and not being intimidated by big egos. He runs the club, Fergie-style, and when the going gets tough, he's not a manager to bail for another club.

Chewie has the height, strength and wingspan to stop pretty much everything. He's basically Sunderland's Costel Pantilimon with more hair. Plus, he maintains that all-important keeper trait: He's a bit crazy, but in a good way -- a player who won't hesitate to bark at his central defense if it loses concentration. Sure, you have to worry about the Wookiee's propensity to pull opponents' arms out of their sockets if he loses, but Chewbacca will put everyone this side of David de Gea to shame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarth Vader: Center Back\n\nHome Planet: Tatooine\n\nBest Skill: The Reducer\n\nYou need an imposing veteran at the back who makes sure everyone's positioning is correct and intimidates opponents by his sheer presence. Enter the original galactic gangster, Darth Vader. A sort of John Terry in a cape and helmet, you won't find anyone better at the dark arts of soccer. Need to take someone down before he's clear on goal? No moral qualms here.

Of course, that happened after Luke disobeyed Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, again showing the young Jedi's impulsive nature. Suffice to say, Louis van Gaal would hate Skywalker's reckless nature.

It's the perfect tandem: Luke opens up space, and Leia runs into it seamlessly and without so much as a wink to alert defenders. Leia also brings more organizational smarts to the attack, and she isn't afraid to take her teammates to task if they get too big for their boots.

Han Solo brings little subtlety to his attacking role. In this intergalactic soccer world, he always shoots first (sorry, Greedo) and exhibits enough street smarts to get into the heads of opponents with his blunt trash talking.

Many goals, Yoda will score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Silva: 'I'm ready to be tested any time'": "As Anderson Silva prepares to return from a one-year suspension stemming from multiple failed drug tests in January, the former UFC middleweight champion says his \"conscience is clear\" regarding any use of performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nSilva, 40, is scheduled to return to the Octagon opposite Michael Bisping on Feb. 27 at O2 Arena in London. It will mark his first appearance since a decision win against Nick Diaz at UFC 183 on Jan. 31. The result of that fight has since been changed to a no-contest.\n\nTwenty-two days before UFC 183, Silva (33-6) submitted a random drug test to the Nevada State Athletic Commission that tested positive for the anabolic steroid drostanolone and a form of androstane. On fight night, he again tested positive for drostanolone, as well as a banned anti-anxiety medication. The bout went on, however, as the NSAC did not receive results of the prefight drug test until after Jan. 31.\n\nWidely considered the greatest fighter of all time, Silva has claimed innocence in regard to the failed tests. In August, he claimed the banned substances came from a contaminated sexual performance-enhancing drug he acquired from Thailand.\n\nSpeaking through a translator Tuesday, Silva said his attorneys at that August disciplinary hearing came off as \"clowns.\" He maintained that he never knowingly ingested any banned substance.\n\nMichael Bisping is pushing for testing throughout camp ahead of the fight with Anderson Silva in February. Martin McNeil for ESPN\n\n\"Inside the Octagon, there's no way to really lie,\" said Silva, who recorded a UFC-best 10 consecutive title defenses from 2007 to 2012. \"I've been fighting my whole career and never tested positive. My conscience is clear. I've never purposefully taken any banned substance. I made an error in taking a substance that was contaminated. I never cheated. In this sport, at the end of the day, whoever is best prepared is going to show on that night.\"\n\nDrug testing within MMA has come a long way in recent years, as athletic commissions have spearheaded efforts to test fighters randomly during training camps as opposed to waiting to do it the night of a fight. In Silva's case, it was the first time he had been tested away from competition.\n\nIn response to a rash of positive tests in 2014 and early 2015, the UFC partnered with the United States Anti-Doping Agency this year to implement its own random drug testing program. Since going into effect in July, the program has administered 349 tests, according to USADA records.\n\nBisping (27-7), who trains out of Southern California, has long chased a fight against Silva, but he hasn't minced words when it comes to the Brazilian's failed drug tests. The 36-year-old Brit has never fought for a UFC championship and has suffered losses to multiple opponents who have experienced licensing issues because of PEDs, including Wanderlei Silva, Chael Sonnen and Vitor Belfort.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is Anderson Silva tested positive for not one, not two, but three banned substances,\" Bisping said. \"While I respect him as a fighter, I've got to say, I lost a lot of respect for him for that. This fight represents me beating all those people who want to cheat the system. I have never taken a performance-enhancing drug in my life. Anybody that does should be ashamed.\n\n\"To call yourself a martial artist and then take a performance-enhancing drug is the biggest contradiction you could ever make. He should be ashamed of himself, and I feel this should be talked about more. I want to be tested throughout camp. I hope that happens, and I hope Anderson is tested.\"\n\nSilva's failed tests stemmed from his only fight in the past two years. In 2013, he surrendered the UFC middleweight title in a knockout loss to Chris Weidman at UFC 162. Later that year, he suffered a broken leg in a TKO loss to Weidman in a title rematch. The injury kept him sidelined for all of 2014.\n\nDespite the hit his legacy has taken from the one-year suspension, Silva says he's not returning in 2016 with any added motivation to prove himself. He says his goal is to reclaim the title, which wasn't the case before the Diaz fight.\n\n\"I'm very motivated to come back. Over the past two years in my career, I've had some bumps in the road and some adversity to overcome.

The Qatari federation had no immediate comment when contacted by The Associated Press.\n\nThe IAAF ethics commission has not yet responded to questions from the AP about Qatar, which beat bids from Eugene, Oregon, and Barcelona to earn the right to stage the world championships for the first time.\n\nEarlier this month, the IAAF suspended the Russian track and field federation after a report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency accused the country of operating a state-sponsored doping program.\n\nThe suspension of the three Kenyan leaders comes a week after a group of athletes occupied the federation's headquarters demanding the removal of top officials in a protest against doping and corruption.\n\nThe IAAF said \"in the interests of the integrity of the sport\" it had suspended Kiplagat, Athletics Kenya vice president David Okeyo, who is also a member of the IAAF's ruling council, and 2015 world championships team leader Joseph Kinyua for 180 days pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nThe three men are accused of \"potential subversion of the anti-doping control process in Kenya\" and the \"potential improper diversion from Athletics Kenya of funds received from Nike.\"\n\nKiplagat and Okeyo are also being investigated by Kenyan police over the alleged misappropriation of more than $700,000 from federation sponsor Nike.\n\n\"I was formally set to relinquish the seat anyway and retire to my farm, but I will fight all allegations against me vigorously,'' Kiplagat said. \"My time in Athletics Kenya was up anyway. Only an accident at home that has kept me in hospital prevented me from handing over.''\n\nKinyua, the former treasurer at Athletics Kenya, maintained that he had \"nothing to worry about.''\n\n\"I responded to charges pertaining to Nike sponsorship in March this year, and there is nothing new involving me since that issue has been revolving for a long time,'' Kinyua said. \"What has happened is fine, and each will have their day to respond to the charges.''\n\nThe ethics commission has appointed Sharad Rao, a former director of public prosecutions in Kenya, as an investigator.\n\nThe cases come at a time with scrutiny over the spike in doping cases in Kenya, with more than 40 athletes failing tests since 2012.", "How a Group of 5 team can make the College Football Playoff": "The American Conference made strides with this year's College Football Playoff committee. ESPN's Heather Dinich joins Adrienne Lawrence to explore what it would take for a non-Power 5 team to finish in the top four. (3:25)\n\nIt is possible for a team from a Group of 5 conference to crack the code into the College Football Playoff semifinals, it just has to have the perfect season, the perfect schedule and the perfect storm.\n\n(So you're saying there's a chance ...)\n\n\"I won't say there's a glass ceiling,\" said Mid-American Conference commissioner Jon Steinbrecher, \"but you wonder.\"\n\nThe Group of 5, comprising the American, Conference USA, Mid-American, Mountain West and Sun Belt, fared far better in the selection committee's Top 25 rankings than it did a season ago but is still perceived as a collection of second-tier teams that has to beat the sport's heavyweights on a consistent basis to earn national respect.\n\nIt definitely made some dents.\n\nMemphis' victory over Ole Miss made the college football world pay attention to the American. Justin Ford/USA TODAY Sports\n\nToledo beat Arkansas. Memphis beat Ole Miss. Temple beat Penn State. Houston beat Louisville and Vanderbilt.\n\nThe American carried the banner with three ranked teams -- No. 18 Houston, No. 21 Navy and No. 24 Temple -- with Houston earning a spot in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl against Florida State because it was the highest-ranked conference champion from the Group of 5.\n\n\"For the American, the strength at the top really helped them,\" CFP executive director Bill Hancock said. \"To have those four quality teams, four teams that the committee clearly respected because they had them in the Top 25 at one point or another, that was absolutely what carried them, four teams of that caliber and the way they performed in their nonconference.\"\n\nThe G5 commissioners agree that the automatic spot in a New Year's Six Bowl makes this system vastly more favorable than the BCS was, but it's still on the outside looking in when it comes to finishing in the top four.\n\n\"I think it certainly has to be the right set of circumstances,\" said former Memphis coach Justin Fuente, who was hired at Virginia Tech in November. \"Is it possible? Sure. Is it very likely? I don't know. Your nonconference schedule has to pretty good, obviously you've got to win them. You're going to have to run the table, and then your league has to help you out. I thought this year our league was good enough that if you had the right nonconference schedule and you made it all the way through that league, then you certainly deserved some serious consideration. It will certainly be difficult, but if you run the table and the dominoes fall the right way for you, you at least have a shot.\"\n\nIt's going to take a Herculean effort to unseat the likes of an Alabama or Oklahoma, but there is a formula for it:\n\nBowling Green has made it a priority to schedule multiple Power 5 teams each season. AP Photo/Nick Wass\n\n1. Schedule aggressively: Bowling Green, which opens at Ohio State next year, and Toledo are two MAC teams that got the memo. The Falcons' nonconference schedule included Tennessee, Maryland, Memphis and Purdue. The Rockets caught the country's attention when they upended Arkansas, and they also beat Iowa State. Those two MAC teams went 4-1 against their Power 5 opponents, with the lone loss coming to a ranked Tennessee team.\n\n\"Early on we titled our schedule 'Fiesta Bowl or bust,'\" said Bowling Green athletic director Chris Kingston, who didn't hesitate to plug in Tennessee after UAB temporarily shut down its program. \"Specifically in the nonconference portion, to have success in that puts us in the national conversation.\"\n\nKingston said he wants to schedule at least two Power 5 teams and two Group of 5 teams annually in the future.\n\n\"I listen to [CFP chairman] Jeff [Long],\" he said. \"I listen to the committee.\"\n\n2. Go undefeated: A two-loss Boise State team played in the Fiesta Bowl last season (and beat Arizona), but any G5 team with aspirations of a semifinal seed simply has no margin for error. Had Memphis gone undefeated and won the American, it absolutely would have been at least considered for a top-four spot -- especially if Ole Miss had gone on to win the SEC.\n\n\"I think this year the Ole Miss-Memphis game was probably the most important game we played,\" American commissioner Mike Aresco said. \"It was the one that galvanized things for us. We got a lot of attention from that.\"\n\n3. Depth in the conference (the American): This is an underrated key to the puzzle, because while athletic directors can control their nonconference schedules, they have zero influence over how good the league might be in any given year. The American carried the banner this season for the Group of 5, with just as many teams as the ACC ranked in the final Top 25.\n\n\"The rising tide in that conference did lift all the boats,\" Hancock said.\n\nThe Mountain West Conference can attest to the benefits of it.\n\n\"Last year we had four 10-win teams and we were a much stronger league,\" commissioner Craig Thompson said. \"This year we had one 10-win team. The American kind of fed off itself. We had that when we had TCU and Utah, and BYU on occasion, all three in the Top 25. You've got to get help from your league schedule, you've got to play the right nonconference schedule and no question -- you have to be 12-0.\"\n\nSee?

(1:51)\n\nAgainst Eric Weddle's wishes, the San Diego Chargers placed the 30-year-old safety on injured reserve Monday with a groin issue, ending his season and likely his nine-year career with the organization.\n\nRubbing salt in the wound, Weddle's agent, David Canter, revealed that the team informed Weddle on Thursday that he will be fined $10,000 for staying out during halftime of what could be San Diego's final game at Qualcomm Stadium on Dec. 20 against the Miami Dolphins to watch his daughter perform at halftime in a program sponsored by the Chargers' cheerleading squad.\n\nWeddle never asked permission to remain on the sideline to watch his daughter perform at halftime; he simply didn't show up in the locker room, a source told ESPN's Ed Werder.\n\nCanter and Weddle were not planning to disclose the fine but decided to announce it after the Chargers told players on injured reserve this week they will not be traveling for the team's final game of the season against the Denver Broncos.\n\nTeam spokesperson Bill Johnston said the Chargers have 17 players on injured reserve, so room for all of them could be an issue. Johnston also said that in the past, players on injured reserve who requested to travel had not been turned down.\n\nFan favorite safety Eric Weddle, who has spent nine years with the Chargers, was fined by the team and placed on IR for the team's final game of the season. This could result in the safety's free-agent departure from the only franchise he's played for. Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images\n\nCanter said he plans to file a grievance with the NFL Players Association on Weddle's behalf.\n\n\"We have a policy here,\" Chargers head coach Mike McCoy said. \"And a situation took place two weeks ago in our stadium. So yes, we did fine him.\"\n\nJohnston said it is mandatory for players to be in the locker room at halftime because coaching adjustments made at that time could be the difference in winning or losing.\n\nMcCoy said Weddle's fine was an organizational decision, one that all but seals Weddle's departure in free agency this offseason. Weddle, an unrestricted free agent in 2016, skipped voluntary workouts last offseason to show his displeasure with the Chargers' unwillingness to sign him to a contract extension.\n\nWeddle said he felt disrespected by the way the organization handled negotiations.\n\n\"If you do bad things to good people, you deserve to have your dirty laundry aired in the limelight,\" Canter told The Associated Press. \"Eric's done nothing but give nine years to the Chargers organization -- his heart, his soul, his body.\"\n\nWeddle led San Diego's defense by playing 961 snaps in 2014. Since 2008, Weddle has played an average of 937 snaps during the regular season.\n\nWeddle is the only safety in the NFL named a first- or second-team All-Pro for five straight seasons. He made $7.5 million in base salary this season in the final year of a five-year, $40 million deal.\n\nWeddle dealt with a nagging groin injury that forced him to miss three games this year. He did not play in the second half of the team's Thursday night contest against the Oakland Raiders after aggravating the injury.\n\nWeddle leads the team in tackles with 77 and also has a half a sack to his credit.", "Rio Olympics air-conditioning proposal sparks memories of cheapness in sports": "The operators of the 2016 Summer Olympics have backed off of a cost-cutting proposal that many observers deemed uncool.\n\nEditor's Picks Feeling heat? Rio to provide free AC after all Rio organizers announce that they will provide free air conditioning to athletes after initially saying countries would have to pay.\n\nA day after suggesting that approximately 10,000 Olympians would have to pay for air-conditioning in their rooms at the athletes village in Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian organizers have reversed course on the embarrassing decision.\n\nStill, the episode evokes memories of many instances of cheapness in sports history. Here's a sampling:\n\nSt. Louis/Arizona Cardinals\n\nBill Bidwill's family has owned the Cardinals since 1933, when they were based in Chicago. Mark J. Rebilas/USA TODAY Sports\n\nLongtime Arizona Cardinals owner Bill Bidwill, nicknamed \"Dollar Bill\" for his thrifty ways, has been criticized for decades about his reluctance to spend. Former defensive back Robert Griffith said the team made players wait to eat on the plane home after road games rather than providing food in the locker room, and that the team once charged him for the FedEx delivery of his contract. When the team was based in St. Louis, players alleged they had to buy their own cleats and were asked to provide explanation as to why they needed new tube socks.\n\nLegendary head coach Don Coryell publicly stated \"I'd like to be fired; let me have a high school job,\" late in the 1977 season largely because the team angered many players over salary negotiations. After that season, a dozen Cardinals players shopped their services to other teams -- 15 years before the onset of unrestricted free agency.\n\nDonald Sterling\n\nBefore being forced to sell the Los Angeles Clippers after receiving an NBA lifetime ban over racist comments, Sterling had a well-deserved reputation for being cheap.\n\nShortly after buying the San Diego Clippers in 1981, he asked if head coach Paul Silas could tape players' ankles so the team wouldn't have to pay a trainer -- and things went downhill from there. Sterling repeatedly refused to re-sign many of the team's lottery picks, notably former No. 1 overall selection Danny Manning.\n\nSterling regularly failed to sign players for depth when injuries ravaged the team's roster. He stopped paying Mike Dunleavy when he fired the coach/general manager in 2010, and Dunleavy later won a $13 million judgment from an arbitrator.\n\nIn the interest of keeping this article under 3,000 words, we'll move on to other subjects.\n\nOakland Raiders\n\nRaiders cheerleaders were making less than minimum wage until they sued the team. AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez\n\nFormer Raiders head coaches Mike Shanahan, Lane Kiffin and Tom Cable have said the team stiffed them of earnings during the stewardship of now-deceased owner Al Davis. Years later, with son Mark Davis running the team, Raiders cheerleaders sued the franchise, alleging they were paid less than $5 per hour. The suit was settled for $1.25 million.\n\nCincinnati Bengals\n\nOwner Mike Brown faced criticism for many years over his miserly habits while the Bengals had the smallest scouting department in the NFL. However, the team might be getting the last laugh by drafting stars such as A.J. Green, Andy Dalton and Geno Atkins in recent years.\n\nChicago Bears\n\nBears founder and longtime owner George Halas hired Mike Ditka to coach the team in 1982. AP Photo/Jewell\n\nLongtime player, coach, general manager and owner George Halas, who paid $100 for his franchise in 1920, feuded with countless players over money -- including some of the biggest stars in team history, such as Sid Luckman, Doug Atkins and George Blanda. Hall of Famer Mike Ditka, a player and coach under Papa Bear, once famously said Halas \"throws around nickels like manhole covers.\"\n\nTexas Longhorns\n\nDuring the tenure of previous athletic director Steve Patterson, the University of Texas eliminated free meals for coaches and staffers -- at a time when the athletic department was grossing more than $160 million annually.\n\nKansas Jayhawks\n\nKansas went 0-12 in its first season under David Beaty, the lowest-paid coach in the Big 12. AP Photo/Rich Schultz\n\nThe University of Kansas paid head football coach David Beaty a base salary of $800,000 this season. That figure is the lowest figure in the Big 12 by about $1 million, and it represents less than one-third of what the school is paying fired predecessor Charlie Weis this year.\n\nLousy tippers\n\nBills running back LeSean McCoy left a 20-cent tip on a dining bill of more than $60 last year, when he was a member of the Philadelphia Eagles; McCoy later said he got lousy service. Other athletes widely reputed to be lousy tippers are Tiger Woods, Dan Marino, Pete Rose, LeBron James, Michael Jordan and Scottie \"No Tippin\" Pippen.\n\nMinnesota Twins\n\nFormer owner Carl Pohlad ran his team on a shoestring budget and allowed many homegrown star players to leave as free agents. At the same time, he repeatedly threatened to move the team if it didn't get a new publicly financed stadium. He nearly took a buyout from MLB to contract the franchise after the 2001 season, but the plan was ultimately blocked.\n\nThat guy ...\n\n... in your fantasy football league who hasn't paid his entry fee for three years.

Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"The sports department found a solution that could allow us to have the air conditioning,\" said Mario Andrada, the spokesman for the 2016 Games. \"So we're buying air conditioning for all the athletes' bedrooms and social rooms.\"\n\nRio organizers are making severe cuts to try to balance their operating budget of 7.4 billion reals ($1.9 billion). Andrada said they are cutting \"fat\" that could reach 2 billion reals ($520 million), which is almost 30 percent of the operating budget.\n\nAndrada termed the reversal \"an evolution and not a change\" in planning for the Olympics, which run Aug. 5-21.\n\nThe decision will be welcomed, and it's apparently a surprise to many.\n\nKitty Chiller, the team chief for the Australian Olympic team, said Friday in an email that she was expecting not to have air conditioning.\n\n\"Rio organizers have told us they will be providing a fan in each of the bedrooms and the lounge room of each apartment,\" she said in a statement. \"This was also confirmed in a meeting with the organizing committee in Brazil this week.\"\n\nChiller said she did not expect the heat to be a problem in the South American winter.\n\n\"We do not anticipate any athletes suffering from any heat stress in the village or anywhere in Rio,\" Chiller wrote.\n\nThough it is winter, the temperature soared on Aug. 19 this year to 35.4 degrees C (95.7 degrees F).\n\nRio Olympic organizers are being buffeted by a deep recession in the country. The local currency has collapsed in value against the dollar, and inflation is running at 10 percent.\n\nThere is also a growing corruption scandal involving state-run oil giant Petrobras that has helped trigger impeachment proceedings against Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff.\n\nOfficials say the Olympic cuts involve \"back stage\" elements unseen on television or by ticket-paying customers. This could involve organizers buying cheaper products and services, cutting signage or using more temporary structures.\n\nThe Games were to have 5,000 employees when they open on Aug. 5.

He died Sunday at his home in Park City, Utah. He was 88.\n\nHis death was confirmed by Deer Valley Resort, where Eriksen served as director of skiing for more than 35 years.\n\nEriksen rose to prominence at the 1952 Winter Olympics in his hometown of Oslo when he captured gold in the giant slalom and silver in the slalom. Two years later, he won three gold medals at the world championships in Are, Sweden.\n\nThe charismatic Eriksen became the face of the sport and portrayed it in a new, exciting way. His somersaults were epic -- and a prelude to the tricks in freestyle skiing.\n\n\"He's a legend,\" Norwegian World Cup racer Kjetil Jansrud said.\n\nStein Eriksen's death was confirmed by Deer Valley Resort, where he served as director of skiing for more than 35 years. Bill Stahl/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nAlthough he was from Norway, Eriksen lived in the U.S. for the last six decades, holding one position after another at various ski resorts around the country. He was director of skiing and a ski school instructor at Snowmass, Colorado. He taught skiing at Sugarbush, Vermont. He even owned his own shop in Aspen, Colorado, in addition to being the ski school director.\n\nHe also made stops in Heavenly Valley, California, and Boyne Mountain, Michigan, before settling in at Deer Valley.\n\n\"His influence in the ski industry and at this resort was infinite, and his legacy will always be a fundamental aspect of Deer Valley,\" said Bob Wheaton, Deer Valley president and general manager. \"He was a true inspiration.\"\n\nHe was such an inspiration, in fact, that he became an honored member of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame in 1982, one of the many awards and accolades he received in his lifetime. According to a Deer Valley release, Eriksen even earned the Knight First Class honor in 1997, which was awarded by the king of Norway for outstanding service in the interest of his country.\n\nThis much is also certain: Eriksen left an indelible impression on Norwegian racers.\n\n\"It's sad that he's gone, but he had a lot of cool experiences in his lifetime and I'm guessing he was blessed and happy with what he accomplished,\" said Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal, who won Olympic gold, silver and bronze at the 2010 Vancouver Games.\n\nAs an up-and-coming racer, Jansrud was once invited to Eriksen's house -- along with the rest of the Norwegian team -- and regaled with story after story.\n\n\"He did a back flip every day at noon in Park City until he was like 80 years old,\" Jansrud said. \"He was doing what he loved.\"\n\nAnd that hair was always styled just right. Or as Jansrud said, \"flawless.\"\n\nSame with the way he skied. He made turns on a hill look so elegant.\n\n\"I guess that's why he went to the U.S. and got on the pro [tour].

With the victory, Alvarez inherited a mandatory defense obligation against Golovkin because, besides his two sanctioning body titles, GGG also holds the WBC\u2019s interim belt.\n\nGolden Boy Promotions\u2019 Oscar De La Hoya, Alvarez\u2019s promoter, and Golovkin promoter Tom Loeffler of K2 Promotions, have been working to make a deal but they are not there yet. So WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman has given them leeway to make a deal. He is trying to help the process.\n\n\u201cThat bout carries enormous implications and is of great importance for boxing, both in terms of history and for the future of the sport,\u201d Sulaiman said. \u201cMany details must be addressed for a super fight of that magnitude to actually occur. The boxers\u2019 respective promoters, Golden Boy Promotions and K2 Promotions, have been communicating in good faith to finalize the details of the negotiations for the contest to come to fruition.\n\n\u201cRecognizing that their discussions have been ongoing, the WBC has given the parties the flexibility to continue to work amicably to finalize terms, with the ultimate goal being that the two champions meet in the ring.\u201d\n\nSulaiman said he plans to attend an in-person negotiating session between the two promoters on Monday in Los Angeles and hopes there is a resolution. If they fail to make a deal, Alvarez risks being stripped of his alphabet belt, something Sulaiman does not want to be forced to do.\n\n\u201cThe WBC's goal is to facilitate this fight, which will be of tremendous magnitude for the sport of boxing and its fans all over the world,\u201d Sulaiman said.\n\nAlthough everyone involved is working toward making a deal, they almost surely will not fight next. More likely, they will make a deal that will allow for the Los Angeles-based Kazakhstan native Golovkin (34-0, 31 KOs), 33, and Alvarez (46-1-1, 32 KOs), 25, of Mexico, to have interim bouts with the goal being for them to meet next fall.\n\nGolovkin likely will fight in late February or early March (at least) with Alvarez already penciled in for his next fight to be in early May.\n\nThe camps have a lot to work out, mainly the weight and the percentage split of the money.\n\nAlvarez claims he is not a true middleweight despite being champion and prefers to fight at about 155 pounds rather than the division limit of 160. He fought Cotto at 155 and his three fights before that were also contracted at 155 pounds.\n\nAs for the split, Alvarez is, by far, the A-side financially. He is a major star who is established on pay-per-view and will command the lion\u2019s share of the money. The question is just how much?\n\nGolovkin\u2019s first pay-per-view fight, a knockout of David Lemieux on Oct. 17 to unify titles, did about 150,000 buys, which was fine based on what the event cost to produce but was less than half what Alvarez has done on pay-per-view for his smallest PPV bouts against Erislandy Lara and Alfredo Angulo. Alvarez\u2019s fight with Floyd Mayweather sold 2.2 million pay-per-views (third-most ever) and his fight with Cotto did 900,000 buys, a very strong number.", "Path to the playoffs: NL West": "Has anything interesting happened in the NL West so far this offseason?\n\nLet's review each team's potential path to the postseason:\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n\n2015: 92-70, plus-72 run differential, lost in division series to Mets\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 95-67\n\n2015 payroll: $291 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $205.6 million\n\nWhoa, hold on here a second -- a 95-67 projected record? I mean, I've heard some of the complaints, read the articles. Listening to MLB Radio the other day, the host described the Dodgers as having the worst offseason of any team so far. Mark Whicker of the Los Angeles Daily News just wrote that Andrew Friedman \"is fast becoming the most polarizing sports executive in town.\" That, \"The problem is that the moves aren't integrated, that nothing really indicates an obvious plan. Or, maybe, there are too many plans.\"\n\nYes, the Dodgers have lost Zack Greinke, and that's a big deal. Over the past two seasons the Dodgers were 46 games over .500 when Greinke or Clayton Kershaw started and two games over .500 when anybody else started. It's fair to say those two carried an otherwise .500 team to two division titles. And that projection has the Dodgers improving?\n\nOK, here's how that can happen even without Aroldis Chapman or Hisashi Iwakuma. Kershaw is still here, and he's the best pitcher in baseball, the one ace most likely to repeat his 2015 performance. FanGraphs projects Brett Anderson and Hyun-Jin Ryu to combine for more than 300 innings and 5.1 WAR. Optimistic? Maybe, given Anderson's long injury history before 2015 and Ryu's shoulder issue that wiped out 2015, but both are good pitchers if they're healthy. Alex Wood is a solid midrotation starter. The bullpen was 19th in the majors in ERA but second in strikeout rate and had the seventh-lowest walk rate. So -- well, the projection systems like those kinds of numbers. (Dodgers fans simply point to the postseason.)\n\nOn offense, it's not difficult to envision a lineup that scores more runs than 2015, when the Dodgers ranked eighth in the NL. Corey Seager should be a big upgrade over Jimmy Rollins and his .285 OBP. Yasiel Puig, who for all the concerns about him, still owns a career .371 OBP. Joc Pederson had that terrible second half but has the plate discipline to rediscover his swing. They have plenty of depth. If anything, that's the key: The Dodgers don't project to be bad at any position.\n\nCould they use another starter? Sure. Maybe they will make a big trade yet. Maybe they will hold on to Julio Urias and Jose De Leon, who could crack the rotation later in the season. The fans are restless, but the Dodgers are still the team to beat in the West.\n\nSan Francisco Giants\n\n2015: 84-78, plus-69 run differential\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 87-75\n\n2015 payroll: $180.7 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $167.9 million\n\nOut: Tim Lincecum, Tim Hudson, Ryan Vogelsong.\n\n2015 combined numbers: 59 starts, 316 innings, 4.39 ERA, 0.1 WAR\n\nIn: Johnny Cueto, Jeff Samardzija.\n\n2016 projected numbers from FanGraphs: 404 innings, 5.9 WAR\n\nThe Giants are hoping for more than a six-win improvement from their two big free-agent signings. In 2014, Cueto was worth 6.4 WAR on Baseball-Reference and Samardzija was worth 3.7. That's what they would like to see.\n\nIf they do, the Giants might be the team to beat in the West.\n\nNote: The payroll suggests there is perhaps room for another signing. Alex Gordon? Justin Upton? Either makes sense, with Gregor Blanco shifting over to become the regular center fielder over Angel Pagan.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks\n\n2015: 79-83, plus-7 run differential\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 79-83\n\n2015 payroll: $79.7 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $98.4 million\n\nNew $206 million ace pitcher? Check. Welcome to town, Zack Greinke.\n\nMVP candidate? Check. Paul Goldschmidt has finished second in the voting in 2013 and 2015.\n\nUnderrated star center fielder? Check. A.J. Pollock has blossomed into one of the best all-around players in the league.\n\nSolid No. 2 starter? Check. Maybe Tony La Russa and Dave Stewart paid too much for Shelby Miller, but they got a guy who gets ground balls, all part of the master plan.\n\nGreat defense? Check. The Diamondbacks led the majors in defensive runs saved in 2015, though the defense will take a major hit with Ender Inciarte going to the Braves in the Miller trade.\n\nSo the D-backs have the nucleus to be a contender. They will need more offense from shortstop Nick Ahmed and whomever ends up at second base (Chris Owings or Aaron Hill). They will need David Peralta to repeat his surprising 2015 (.893 OPS). They will need Yasmany Tomas -- or maybe Socrates Brito -- to step up and produce in right field. They will need Patrick Corbin to produce in his first full year back from Tommy John surgery.\n\nIf all that happens? Maybe the D-backs can win the NL West.\n\nSan Diego Padres\n\n2015: 74-88, minus-81 run differential\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 76-86\n\n2015 payroll: $110.3 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $99.4 million\n\nLast offseason, A.J. Preller was busy collecting baseball players -- but not a baseball team. He ended up with three right fielders and no shortstop. Their first basemen were next-to-last in the majors in home runs. Bringing in Wil Myers ended up costing the Padres Trea Turner, Joe Ross and sleeper prospect Jake Bauers.\n\nStill, for all that, it was the pitching that killed the 2015 Padres. The Padres scored 115 more runs; maybe not as many as Preller expected but still a significant increase. They allowed 154 more, however, and the net result was three fewer wins.\n\nSo what now? The FanGraphs projection doesn't like the Padres much, projecting them as the fifth-worst team in the majors. Preller has traded away his two best relievers (Craig Kimbrel and Joaquin Benoit) and infielders Jedd Gyorko and Yonder Alonso, with Myers likely taking over at first base and Cory Spangenberg at second. Justin Upton is gone.\n\nIn other words, it's hard to see the Padres improving much. But this is supposed to be a path to the playoffs, so here goes: Matt Kemp improves on his .265/.312/.443 line; Myers has a monster, .300/30-homer season; James Shields and Andrew Cashner each lower their ERA by a run; Tyson Ross cuts down on his walks and posts a sub-3.00 ERA; the no-name bullpen delivers; Melvin Upton Jr. hits 28 home runs as he did back in 2012.\n\nColorado Rockies\n\n2015: 68-94, minus-107 run differential\n\nProjected 2016 record from FanGraphs: 73-89\n\n2015 payroll: $107.6 million\n\nProjected 2016 payroll from Baseball-Reference: $101.8 million\n\nThe Troy Tulowitzki era is over, ending with a large thud as the Rockies lost 94 games -- their fifth season in a row with at least 88 losses.\n\nThe Carlos Gonzalez trade rumors persist, but trading him isn't going to turn around the franchise. This is what will: A starting pitcher -- or five -- who can throw more than 150 innings. Jorge De La Rosa led the staff with 149 innings in 2015.\n\nOn offense, the Rockies led the league in runs scored, but that's a product of Coors Field. Nolan Arenado hit .287 with 42 home runs but had a .323 OBP; that's not great for any home field, let alone Coors. Charlie Blackmon had a .347 OBP but just .300 on the road. And those are their best players. In other words: The offense is arguably just as much of an issue as the pitching.\n\nI guess I didn't provide a path to the playoffs. In this division, with their current rotation and lineup, it's a very narrow road along a very windy cliff. Maybe Arenado hits 50 home runs and boosts that OBP. Blackmon learns to hit on the road. Corey Dickerson returns with a healthy season. CarGo is traded for some pitching help. Jose Reyes discovers the fountain of youth. And somehow the Rockies find a bunch of pitchers who can make 30 starts and a bullpen that can keep its ERA under 4.70 (worst in the majors).", "Luis Ortiz impresses in destruction of Bryant Jennings": "A roundup of the past week's notable boxing results from around the world:\n\nSaturday at Verona, New York\n\nLuis Ortiz TKO7 Bryan Jennings\n\nRetains an interim heavyweight title\n\nRecords: Ortiz (24-0, 21 KOs); Jennings (19-2, 10 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: The heavyweight division is wide open and could be fun again now that Tyson Fury has pulled a huge upset by ending world champion Wladimir Klitschko's 9\u00bd-year title reign on Nov. 28. Although Klitschko may very well reclaim the title in their spring rematch, there are new names making the case that they are the future of the heavyweight division.\n\nAmong them are titleholder Deontay Wilder, who although facing mediocre opposition, is as entertaining as any of the big men. There is the No. 1 heavyweight prospect in England's big-punching Anthony Joshua, the 2012 Olympic super heavyweight gold medalist who is making a bigger impression with each big knockout. Now you must add Ortiz to that list. The southpaw banger looks like an absolute wrecking machine and the real deal, a guy who could make serious noise and do major damage in the division if anyone dares to fight him.\n\nPunch stats Punches Ortiz Jennings Landed 128 136 Thrown 441 327 Percent 29% 42% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\nTo Jennings' credit, he did but he paid a painful price. Ortiz, 36, a former Cuban amateur standout (a 343-19 record) who defected and lives in Miami, seems to have all the tools. His amateur pedigree is supreme. He has tremendous power, fast hands, good footwork, solid defense and excellent size (6-foot-4, 240 pounds).\n\nHe brought that all to bear against Jennings, 31, of Philadelphia (who had just 17 amateur fights). Jennings was coming off an April 25 lopsided decision loss to then-champion Klitschko but turned in a credible performance. He turned in another credible one against Ortiz but was simply outgunned in a really good fight that closed out a fine year of fights on HBO.\n\nOrtiz, making the first defense of the interim belt he won Oct. 17 by one-sided third-round knockout of unknown Matias Ariel Vidondo (Ortiz's second bout after returning from a suspension due to a positive steroid test), had Jennings in major trouble in the opening round after he landed heavy shots that took his legs away. Jennings kept himself together and had a good second round but Ortiz was a man on a mission. He took whatever Jennings could dish out and gave it right back with even more force.\n\nOrtiz had a huge third round as he badly hurt Jennings with an uppercut and chopping left hand. It appeared to be a matter of time until Ortiz was going to take Jennings out and it finally happened in the seventh round. He landed a howitzer of a left uppercut that dropped Jennings face first. Most guys would have been out cold. Jennings, who was in superb condition, rose to his knees quickly and beat the count. Most referees probably would have stopped the fight because Jennings was in a bad way. He was aware of his surroundings but his legs were not in control. Ortiz nailed him with a right hand that sent him into the ropes (it could have been called a knockdown but was not) and then a left hand that rocked his world, at which point referee Richard Pakozdi stepped in to stop the fight at 2 minutes, 41 seconds. While Ortiz, known as \"The Real King Kong,\" climbed the ring post and beat his chest, Jennings had no complaints about the stoppage and even said later that it was a \"good stoppage.\"\n\nIt was the end of a tremendous heavyweight fight, one in which Ortiz's stock went through the roof. People are going to want to see him fight. A lot. And even in the loss, Jennings acquitted himself well, made a great fight and showed true professionalism after a tough loss.\n\nNicholas Walters D10 Jason Sosa\n\nJunior lightweights\n\nScores: 95-95 (twice), 96-94 Sosa\n\nRecords: Walters (26-0-1, 21 KOs); Sosa (18-1-4, 14 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Scan history for the worst decisions you can think of. There is the laughable draw that robbed Lennox Lewis of the undisputed heavyweight championship in his first fight with Evander Holyfield. There is the scandalous draw given to Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. after he was soundly outclassed by Pernell Whitaker. All three judges were suspended for rendering a joke of a decision that gave Paul Williams a majority decision against Erislandy Lara. How about Jose Armando Santa Cruz being blatantly robbed of the lineal lightweight title against Joel Casamayor? And, of course, the gift split decision given to Timothy Bradley Jr. in the first fight with Manny Pacquiao that outraged the world?\n\nPunch stats Punches Walters Sosa Landed 281 168 Thrown 622 873 Percent 45% 19% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\nWell, add another to the list as Walters, a former featherweight titleholder moving up to junior lightweight, was horribly ripped off and given a draw with Sosa in a fight in which he totally dominated.\n\nPerhaps this fight is not of the same significance as those others but the scoring by judges Don Ackerman and Wynn Kintz (95-95 each), and Tom Schreck (96-94 for Sosa!) was as bad as it gets. Literally every single member of the ringside media had Walters winning easily, mostly by 10-0 or 9-1 in rounds. HBO's Max Kellerman had it 10-0. HBO's Harold Lederman had it 9-1. Social media was awash with landslides for Walters. The scores rendered by the judges were absolutely laughable.\n\nYes, Sosa, 27, of Camden, New Jersey, in his first fight against a quality opponent, was game and ready to fight. He showed a lot of heart, landed some nice shots and has nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, most people probably would want to see him again because of his spirited effort. But Walters, 29, of Jamaica, in his first fight since being stripped of his 126-pound belt for failing to make weight for a June defense against Miguel Marriaga, ran roughshod over Sosa in every way possible. He was very clearly the heavier hitter and outlanded Sosa in every single round, according to CompuBox punch statistics. Further, he landed way more punches overall, connecting on 281 of 622 (45 percent) while Sosa landed 168 of 873 (19 percent).\n\nThroughout the fight, Walters walked Sosa down and abused him to the body (where he landed 118 punches to Sosa's 39). He manhandled him round after round and rocked him several times. This should have been an easy fight to score because the rounds were not close. It was all Walters in a dominant performance in which he hurt Sosa numerous times. When it was over Walters was very disappointed. When asked how he was scoring the fight in his head he said he won thought he won every round but \"it's Christmas, so I gave him one round.\" In reality, it was the judges who stole a win from Walters and gave Sosa the ultimate Christmas gift of a draw. Everyone should simply view this is a win for Walters and move on, although the judges should be forced to explain themselves.\n\nVyacheslav Shabranskyy W10 Yunieski Gonzalez\n\nLight heavyweights\n\nScores: 98-92, 97-93, 95-95\n\nRecords: Shabranskyy (15-0, 12 KOs); Gonzalez (16-2, 12 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Headlining the HBO Latino portion of the card, Shabranskyy, 28, a Ukraine native living in Los Angeles, pulled the mild upset in a terrific battle against Gonzalez, 30, a Cuban defector living in Miami.\n\nPunch stats Punches Gonzalez Shabranskyy Landed 178 261 Thrown 603 821 Percent 30% 32% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\nWhile Shabranskyy was coming off a third-round knockout win against Paul Parker in June, the unknown Parker dropped him twice in the first round and left many questioning his chin. A month later, Gonzalez got his first wide exposure when he landed a fight on HBO against former light heavyweight champion Jean Pascal. In a blazing battle, Gonzalez seemed to get the better of the action but lost a heavily disputed decision that the judges gave to Pascal 96-94 across the board. With so many believing that Gonzalez beat Pascal and with Shabranskyy having had so many problems last time out, most viewed Gonzalez as the heavy favorite.\n\nIt did not quite work out that way as Shabranskyy got the better of the action overall, which heated up in the third round with Shabranskyy hurting Gonzalez on the ropes, Gonzalez coming back and the round ending with them trading toe-to-toe. They both landed big bombs throughout the fight and they both showed good chins, especially Gonzalez after he nailed Shabranskyy with a right hand as the seventh round ended. They closed the fight with a memorable 10th round in which they traded with abandon.\n\nIn the end, Shabranskyy got the nod from two judges after having landed 261 of 821 punches (32 percent), according to CompuBox punch statistics, while Gonzalez connected on 178 of 603 blows (30 percent). It was a huge win for Shabranskyy (and his promoter, Golden Boy) because he immediately becomes a fighter to watch closely in an increasingly busy weight division. And even with a second loss in a row, Gonzalez remains a quality fighter fans should want to see again.\n\nGabriel Rosado W10 Joshua Clottey\n\nMiddleweights\n\nScores: 97-93 (twice), 96-94\n\nRecords: Rosado (22-9, 13 KOs); Clottey (39-5, 22 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Few fighters needed a win more than Rosado and he got in a fairly crowd-pleasing fight while also working with former two-time junior middleweight titleholder Fernando Vargas as his trainer for the first time. Rosado, 29, of Philadelphia, who stars in the new Rocky movie \"Creed,\" finally ended a five-fight winless streak, having gone 0-4 with a no decision since 2012 in official boxing matches against top opponents (including in cut-induced stoppage losses in world title fights against Gennady Golovkin and Peter Quillin), although he went 1-0-1 in unofficial Big Knockout Boxing bouts.\n\nPunch stats Punches Rosado Clottey Landed 166 133 Thrown 791 455 Percent 21% 29% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\nComing off a one-year layoff, Rosado looked rusty early as Clottey, 38, a Ghana native who fights out of New York, appeared to open a lead. The fight was contracted at 158 pounds to accommodate Clottey, a former welterweight titlist who has been fighting at 154 pounds and looked a lot smaller than Rosado.\n\nAs the fight went on Rosado began to get more into the flow, although he eventually had swelling around both eyes but avoided the cuts that have plagued his recent career. Later in the fight Rosado began to force Clottey into the ropes and make him more defensive as he came on strong in the second half of the bout to win the competitive fight. Rosado had Clottey in trouble in the eighth round and Clottey was warned for landing a low blow in the ninth round. It seemed like a very close fight, so they both let it all hang out in the 10th round, but Rosado won the round on two scorecards as he landed some clean shots to force Clottey backward.\n\nIt was a good win for Rosado after such a rough stretch. Rosado would like a May shot against middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez, but a win over Clottey after a winless streak should not be enough to land that caliber of fight. Clottey saw a four-fight winning streak since back-to-back losses to Miguel Cotto (2009) and Manny Pacquiao (2010) in welterweight title fights come to an end.\n\nYuriorkis Gamboa W10 Hylon Williams Jr.\n\nLightweights\n\nScores: 98-92 (twice), 96-94\n\nRecords: Gamboa (25-1, 17 KOs); Williams (16-2-1, 3 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Despite another long layoff, former unified featherweight titlist Gamboa, who turns 34 on Wednesday, looked pretty sharp in a one-sided win against Williams, 25, of Houston.\n\nPunch stats Punches Gamboa Williams Landed 137 64 Thrown 572 343 Percent 24% 19% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\nGamboa, a 2004 Cuban Olympic gold medalist who defected and fights out of Miami, has had chronic inactivity. He was fighting for only the fourth time since 2013 and for the first time in 13 months, partly due to his own doing -- turning down fights -- and partly due to the weak promotional efforts of rap star Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson, who was ringside. Gamboa, two fights removed from a ninth-round knockout loss to then-lightweight champion Terence Crawford in a 2014 fight of the year candidate, looked fast and powerful as he beat Williams to the punch throughout the fight and landed a lot of clean shots with both hands.\n\nWilliams, who isn't a puncher at all, didn't look as though he had any impact on Gamboa with his punches, even though Gamboa has been knocked down several times. After a three-year layoff, Williams is now 0-1-1 since his return in August. Ultimately, Gamboa got in 10 solid rounds and hopefully will stay more active. A title shot at junior lightweight would not be out of the question or even a fight with fellow former featherweight titlist Nicholas Walters, which would be very interesting.\n\nSaturday at Manchester, England\n\nBilly Joe Saunders W12 Andy Lee\n\nWins a middleweight title\n\nScores: 115-111, 114-112, 113-113\n\nRecords: Saunders (23-0, 12 KOs); Lee (34-3-1, 24 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: After two postponements of Lee's mandatory defense it was hardly worth the wait. Instead of an exciting fight that they promised we got one action-packed round and little else but a fight devoid of entertainment unless your thing is watching a passive Lee getting jabbed around the ring by fellow southpaw Saunders.\n\nLee, 31, of Ireland, a 2004 Olympian, and Saunders, 26, of England, a 2008 Olympian, were due to fight Sept. 19 in Lee's hometown of Limerick, but Lee came down with a virus and the fight was postponed. It was rescheduled for Oct. 10 in Manchester but Saunders suffered a cut over his right eye during a sparring session, forcing a second postponement.\n\nLee won the vacant belt last December when he rallied from being way down on all three scorecards for a one-punch knockout of Matt Korobov courtesy of his awesome right hook. Lee retained the title on April 11 in a split draw against overweight Peter Quillin in a fight in which he knocked Quillin down but got dropped twice himself.\n\nAgainst Saunders, Lee, making his second defense, also tasted the canvas as Saunders floored him twice in the wild third round. The first knockdown came on a right hook out of nowhere and the second came moments later on another counter right hand that forced Lee to catch himself on the mat with his gloves from going all the way down.\n\nFrom there, Saunders was content to jab, jab and jab some more as he was obviously very wary of Lee's power. It was not the most entertaining game plan to watch him execute but it worked because Lee was not aggressive at all until the last few rounds when perhaps he realized his title was slipping away.\n\n\"I'm world champion,\" Saunders said. \"I beat a good champion today, a good sturdy champion. I used his power against him. When I was boxing he got a little bit careless and dropped his lead hand and I caught him with the hook. I'm not going to start running my mouth, but it was a good shot. With someone as fast as me you have to keep your hands up. I'm not the biggest puncher in the world, but I showed you there that I can punch.\"\n\nHad Lee won most believed he would embrace an immediate unification fight in 2016 with either Gennady Golovkin or Daniel Jacobs, both of which would be high-profile fights the fans would probably get behind. However with Saunders taking the belt few believe he will accept that caliber of fight right away or that his promoter, Frank Warren, will look to make that fight. Saunders more likely will remain in England and look to protect the belt against at least a couple of soft touches. Hopefully, he and Warren prove the conventional wisdom wrong.\n\nLiam Smith TKO7 Jimmy Kelly\n\nRetains a junior middleweight title\n\nRecords: Smith (22-0-1, 12 KOs); Kelly (16-1, 7 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: After inactive Demetrius Andrade was stripped of his 154-pound world title, Smith squared off with John Thompson on Oct. 10 for the vacant belt and Smith knocked him out in the seventh round.\n\nMaking his first defense, Smith, 27, of England, took on countryman Kelly, 23, in what was billed as a rival city fight because Smith is from Liverpool and Kelly from Manchester, and there had not been a world title bout between fighters from those cities in more than 80 years. Kelly came into the fight with a glossy record built against nobodies and his inexperience showed as Smith broke him down with accurate body and head shots. The most Kelly could must on offense was to purposely head butt Smith in the sixth round, which did not fly with referee Marcus McDonnell, who docked him two points for the flagrant foul. As Smith continued to dole out punishment to a bloodied, battered and exhausted Kelly in the seventh round, Kelly's trainer Ensley Bingham -- who challenged for the same belt in a lopsided decision loss to Winky Wright in 1996 -- threw in the towel and McDonnell stopped the bout at 2 minutes, 35 seconds.\n\nSmith said he knew all along that he was the more talented fight. \"Kelly put up a tough challenge, but I knew that I was levels above him,\" Smith said. \"I was comfortable in there and I started breaking him down from the beginning and I knew I was hurting him when I was landing the body shots. He was a hard man and was hanging in there and I said to his corner to pull their man out. They did in the seventh. I'm sure Kelly can build himself back up again. As for me, I'd love a unification fight in 2016. I know there are big fights on the horizon and I can't wait.\"\n\nFriday at Las Vegas\n\nRances Barthelemy W12 Denis Shafikov\n\nWins a vacant lightweight title\n\nScores: 119-109, 116-112 (twice)\n\nRecords: Barthelemy (24-0, 13 KOs); Shafikov (36-2-1, 19 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Barthelemy, 29, a Cuban defector fighting out of Las Vegas, won a junior lightweight world title in 2014, made one dominant defense and then vacated the belt when it became increasingly difficult for him to make 130 pounds. Now he has a second world title in his collection after a strong performance in outpointing 30-year-old Russian southpaw Shafikov, who failed in his second shot at a world title, having lost a decision challenging then-titleholder Miguel Vazquez in 2014 in Macau, China. Shafikov won his next fights to box his way into the fight with Barthelemy as they met for the belt stripped from Mickey Bey for his refusal to fight Shafikov, his mandatory challenger.\n\nPunch stats Punches Barthelemy Shafikov Landed 260 228 Thrown 871 931 Percent 30% 25% -- Courtesy of CompuBox\n\nAs expected, Shafikov was the aggressor and that paid off through the first half of the fight when he appeared to give Barthelemy all kinds of problems, especially with his body attack. But Barthelemy turned things around, boxed well over the second half of the entertaining bout and slowed Shafikov down a bit when he opened a cut over his right eye late in the seventh round that he targeted thereafter. The blood flowed and referee Vic Drakulich called for the ringside doctor to examine the wound during the eighth round.\n\nBarthelemy finished strongly, outlanding Shafikov 43-18 over last three rounds, according to CompuBox punch statistics, to leave little doubt that he had won -- although the 119-109 scorecard turned in by judge Robert Hoyle was way out of line. Overall, Barthelemy landed 260 of 871 punches (30 percent) and Shafikov connected on 228 of 931 punches (25 percent).\n\nMurat Gassiev No Decision 3 Isiah Thomas\n\nCruiserweight title eliminator\n\nRecords: Gassiev (22-0, 16 KOs); Thomas (15-0, 6 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Power-punching Gassiev, 22, of Russia, and Thomas, a 26-year-old slick southpaw from Detroit (yes, he is named after the Hall of Fame Detroit Pistons point guard, whom his mother was a big fan of), met with a lot on the line -- a shot at world titleholder Victor Emilio Ramirez (22-2-1, 17 KOs) of Argentina. Neither will get the shot based on this result, a disappointing no decision due to an unusual ending.\n\nThrough the first three rounds, Thomas did a nice job of outboxing Gassiev. But at the end of the third round Gassiev landed two wicked shots to the head. He bashed Thomas into the ropes with a powerful right hand and then landed a second right hand. However, the second one landed just after the bell -- although clearly not on purpose -- and referee Jay Nady decided to stop the fight on advice of the ringside doctor and ruled it a no decision because of the accidental foul. Nady said Thomas was in a diminished state from the late blow and unable to continue. Because four rounds had not been completed it was a no decision rather than going to the scorecards for a technical decision.\n\nEric Walker W8 Chris Pearson\n\nJunior middleweights\n\nScores: 80-72, 79-71, 78-74\n\nRecords: Walker (12-0, 6 KOs); Pearson (13-1, 10 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Pearson, 25, of Dayton, Ohio, a blue-chip prospect in the Floyd Mayweather promotional stable, suffered a bad upset loss to Walker, 32, of Plaquemine, Louisiana, who had spent 13 years in prison. Pearson had faced much better opponents -- and done well -- but not on this night. Walker, whose record was built against horrific opposition, soundly outboxed and outfought him in an entertaining battle. Walker surprisingly dominated most of the fight, which featured exciting exchanges, especially in the fifth round (when Pearson was rocked) and the final three rounds of the fight that had the crowd, which included Mayweather, on its feet.\n\n\"If you believe in God and work hard at what you're doing, you're going to succeed,\" Walker said. \"Look at me now. I had watched his previous fights and knew that my right hand would be too much for him and that I could land it anytime. My conditioning was really the difference. I was in great shape and I was able to rely on that when the going got tough.\" Pearson was humble in defeat and said he hoped to get a rematch. \"I take my hat off to him,\" Pearson said. \"His punches were crisp and hard. I just couldn't get going on anything consistently. I thought it was closer than the judges' scorecards and I definitely want a rematch as soon as possible.\"\n\nGervonta \"Tank\" Davis KO9 Luis Sanchez\n\nLightweights\n\nRecords: Davis (14-0, 13 KOs); Sanchez (17-5-1, 5 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Davis, 21, of Baltimore, has gotten his share of hype, especially from promoter Floyd Mayweather, who has talked him up and was ringside to watch him take out Sanchez, 23, of Mexico, in a hard-fought fight. Sanchez forced Davis to go beyond six rounds for the first time but ultimately felt his power. Davis dropped Sanchez with an uppercut in the eight round and then knocked him down with a nasty left hook in the ninth round. He went down hard and referee Kenny Bayless did not bother to finish the count as he waved it off at 2 minutes, 5 seconds.\n\n\"It felt great to fight all of these rounds and get the work in,\" Davis said. \"He's a tough fighter and I learned a great deal tonight. It was a very good experience for me. I just listened to my corner and Floyd, took my time and broke him down. I want to fight again as soon as possible for a world title.\"\n\nTwo former world titleholders were also on the card: Former lightweight titlist Mickey Bey (22-1-1, 10 KOs), 32, of Cleveland, fought for the first fight since winning a belt in September 2014 and getting stripped of it for turning down career-high money multiple times to make his mandatory defense against Denis Shafikov. Bey rolled to a near-shutout decision against Niam Nelson (12-1-1, 1 KO), 25, of Philadelphia, winning by scores of 100-90, 100-90 and 99-91. Also, former junior middleweight titlist Ishe Smith (28-8, 12 KOs), 37, of Las Vegas, cruised to a shutout decision against 35-year-old club fighter Tommy Rainone (24-7-1, 5 KOs), 35, of Plainview, New York, winning 100-90 on all three scorecards.\n\nFriday at Indio, California\n\nJoseph Diaz Jr. TKO2 Hugo Partida\n\nFeatherweights\n\nRecords: Diaz (19-0, 11 KOs); Partida (21-7-2, 16 KOs)\n\nRafael's remarks: Diaz, 23, a 2012 U.S. Olympian from South El Monte, California, finished off a fine 5-0 year with a blistering destruction of Partida, 27, of Mexico, who lost his third fight in a row, including two by knockout inside two rounds. Diaz, a top-tier prospect with a fan-friendly style, blasted out Partida, who could not deal with Diaz's speed and power. Diaz punished him with body blows in the opening round and when he trapped him on the ropes in the second round and hammered him with about 10 unanswered left hooks to the head, referee Pat Russell intervened to stop the fight at 1 minute, 32 seconds.\n\n\"We came with a great game plan to land effective shots right away and to dig to the body and try to hurt him,\" Diaz said. \"I dug into the body in the first round and had him hurt. And then I put some good powerful shots on top and got him out. He connected with a good shot, but I didn't feel anything at all. I just acknowledge him for getting a good shot in. I didn't let it affect me at all. I knew that I had to take care of business and get the win no matter what. I hope to get the top 10 guys in my division, fight on the bigger networks and get a title shot by the end of next year. I feel very strong at this weight, and I make the weight pretty good. I just feel like 126 is going to be my weight.\"\n\nTaishan Dong W4 Daniel Arambula\n\nHeavyweights\n\nScores: 39-36 (twice), 38-37\n\nRecords: Dong (6-0, 3 KOs); Arambula (3-2, 1 KO)\n\nRafael's remarks: The 27-year-old Taishan, a 7-foot, 280-pound mountain of a man from China, has awesome size but is a project as a boxer. He is extraordinarily raw but his size is so tantalizing he will be given every opportunity to see if he can become a serious fighter. At the moment he is not. He needs work in every area possible but he got in four ugly rounds as he wrestled his way to a decision over Arambula, 24, of Mexico, who at 212 pounds looked puny compared to him. Taishan struggled against Arambula and should he ever fight a real opponent he will not be able to rely on only his size to get a win. He recognizes that he needs work.\n\n\"I'm not very happy because I wanted the knockout,\" Taishan said. \"I had a lot of practice, but I think I still need to train more.\"", "Eugenie Bouchard, Casey Dellacqua And Concussions In Women's Tennis": "Eugenie Bouchard, Casey Dellacqua And Concussions In Women's Tennis\n\nElsa/Getty Images Casey Dellacqua suffered a concussion from an on-court fall in October. She already has pulled the plug on her January schedule.\n\nSprained ankles? Yup. Torn rotator cuffs? You know it. Pulled hamstrings, strained abdominals, sprained wrists, stiff knees, inflamed backs? Check, check, check, check and check. The list of ailments tennis players deal with over the course of their brutal year-round seasons reads like a human anatomy textbook.\n\nNow, it seems, we need to add a chapter on concussions.\n\nWhile brain trauma caused by a blow to the head will never be an everyday occurrence in an individual, non-contact sport such as tennis, two high-profile cases invaded the WTA Tour in 2015 and will linger into at least the start of 2016.\n\nAustralian Casey Dellacqua, who made it to the doubles final at both the French Open and US Open this year, suffered a season-ending concussion in October from an on-court fall in Beijing. Earlier, Canadian star Eugenie Bouchard fell in a US Open locker room that led to her fourth-round withdrawal from the year's final major.\n\nEven as concussions have become part of our pop-culture lexicon -- prompting rule changes and new medical protocols in sports, not to mention the upcoming movie \"Concussion,\" starring Will Smith -- there are still those who think head-injury awareness has morphed into hypersensitivity. So-called \"old-school\" sports fans remember the days when athletes played through serious physical issues without regard to potentially dangerous long-term consequences. In tennis, where there is little risk of a repeat injury, some fans struggle to sympathize with lingering concussion symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, visual disturbances and memory loss as players attempt a return to the tour. How bad, they say, can it be?\n\n***\n\nOn the night of her accident, Bouchard returned to the US Open training room for an ice bath after the staff had left for the day, according to a member of her team. A dark room and a recently mopped floor allegedly led to a backwards fall, a blow to the back of her head and an end to her disappointing 2015 season. A month later, the 21-year-old retired from her comeback match in Beijing, citing dizziness. She hasn't played competitively since.\n\nSentiments like the following from an online commenter have been echoed by casual observers of the Bouchard case: \"I've never really known someone to need this long to recover from a concussion brought on by a fall. Sure, a car accident or something like that. Perhaps she's just trying to gather herself after the whole incident and this terrible year.\"\n\nAP Photo/Andy Wong Eugenie Bouchard shut her season down after a scary comeback attempt in Beijing.\n\nDr. Summer Ott, neuropsychological consultant for the Houston Texans and Houston Rockets, as well as the director of the Memorial Hermann IRONMAN Sports Medicine Institute's Sports Concussion Program, is all too familiar with concussion skeptics.\n\n\"Would you want your ACL surgical repair conducted with 20-year-old technology?\" Ott asked, explaining how she addresses doubters. \"Most people are going to say no. You wouldn't care for your brain in an antiquated way, either.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Neurology first released standardized guidelines for grading and managing concussions in 1997. That blanket system of evaluation was largely overhauled in 2013 in favor of a more individualized approach. The revised standards recommend that any athlete thought to be experiencing concussion symptoms be removed from competition immediately, giving no set timeline for a return to play.\n\nPart of the challenge, experts say, is that unlike traumatic brain injuries, concussions leave no pathological findings on traditional neuroimaging tests such as CT or MRI; nothing that doctors can use to definitively diagnose their severity or predict recovery time. Medical professionals have years of research and empirical evidence proving that whether you're a football player, a tennis player or have no athletic background at all, concussions can be life-altering.\n\n***\n\nPittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was battered -- taking rattling hit after rattling hit -- during a Nov. 29 game against the Seattle Seahawks. Finally, after a shot to the head in the fourth quarter, he took himself out. Compared to the violent impacts like those in football -- and similar collisions in hockey and soccer -- Bouchard and Dellacqua's falls may seem innocuous.\n\nBut Ott says a fluke injury can be even more dangerous than the blows we see in contact sports.\n\n\"If you're a lineman and you're going toward someone to block them, you're naturally tightening your neck muscles and bracing for that impact,\" Ott said. \"If you think about something like a car accident, there is nothing you are doing with your body to soften that blow.\n\n\"When people fall and hit the back of their head, those concussions can be pretty nasty because they affect so many things like our sleep-wake cycles, our nausea centers and our visual-motor cortex,\" Ott continued. \"Sometimes it's more about region of the hit than the sport you're playing.\"\n\nWhile rare in tennis, Dellacqua and Bouchard aren't the first WTA athletes to battle concussion-induced layoffs. As a 17-year-old, American Lauren Davis, now 22, was briefly knocked unconscious when lighting and video equipment fell on her head during a 2011 interview. In addition to sitting out for nearly three months with intense headaches, she experienced emotional effects, which were later diagnosed as post-concussion syndrome.\n\nSometimes it's more about region of the hit than the sport you're playing. Dr. Summer Ott\n\n\"I suffered the worst anxiety everywhere,\" Davis said at the 2014 Miami Open. \"If it weren't for my faith and the people God put in my life, I would have quit [tennis] so long ago.\"\n\nWith the rise in concussion awareness, most are familiar with the general symptoms, but the length of time necessary for recovery varies.\n\nFormer world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka tripped and hit her head during her off-court warm-up before her second-round match at the 2010 US Open. Disoriented, she fell to the ground just 30 minutes into the contest and left the stadium in a wheelchair.\n\n\"When I got a concussion, I was racing to the court 15 minutes after I fell, so that's why I collapsed,\" Azarenka explained. \"That probably wasn't a very smart move, but I didn't know what I had at that moment.\"\n\nAzarenka was lucky. She had no lingering effects and took a week off before hitting the courts again with a clean bill of health. But a premature return to competition can have serious consequences.\n\n\"Athletes are sometimes rushed back even faster in sports like tennis and golf because they think, 'Well, I'm not heading a soccer ball or hitting another football player with contact to the helmet,' \" Ott said, adding that a concussed tennis player could struggle with everything from reaction times to the ability to remember an opponent's scouting report. \"The brain may have difficulty regulating blood flow in the first few hours and days following a concussion, so when players increase their heart rate, it aggravates the brain and worsens symptoms.\"\n\nBouchard reiterated that theory while retiring from her comeback match in October, telling opponent Andrea Petkovic that her symptoms tend to return with physical activity. The Montreal native, who is suing the United States Tennis Association as a result of her fall, spoke publicly about her status for the first time at a November promotional appearance in Toronto.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to being healthy and playing next year,\" said Bouchard, who plans to return to play in January at the Hobart International, a tune-up for the Australian Open. \"It's all a process.\"\n\nDellacqua can no doubt sympathize with Bouchard's lengthy rehab.\n\nIt has been nearly two months since Dellacqua's fall, and on Friday, the 30-year-old withdrew from the Australian Open, which starts Jan. 18. Her manager, Sam Maxwell, said Dellacqua is still having headaches and neck pains.\n\n\"Unfortunately I have not sufficiently recovered from the concussion injury I sustained at the China Open in Beijing in October and have been forced to withdraw from the whole Australian tennis summer,\" Dellacqua wrote on Twitter on Friday. \"It is a shame that I won't be playing in front of the Aussie fans this year.\"\n\nSprained ankles, stiff backs and torn rotator cuffs probably sound pretty good to Dellacqua right about now.", "Andy Murray hopeful for 2016 springboard after Davis Cup victory": "Andy Murray hopes he can emulate Novak Djokovic in turning Davis Cup success into a stellar season in 2016.\n\nDjokovic's elevation to the top of the world game began after he helped Serbia win their first Davis Cup five years ago.\n\nThe following season he won three grand slam titles and has been the dominant force almost ever since, reaching 15 of the last 20 slam finals.\n\nMurray had the most consistent season of his career in 2015 and finished it ranked No.2 in the world for the first time, but a slam title eluded him.\n\nAsked if the Davis Cup could be a springboard, he told the Press Association: \"I hope so. I'll obviously try to use it as much as I can for next year.\n\n\"The most important thing is, yes, enjoy it now, but don't let it go on for like three weeks and stop practising hard and going to the gym and doing everything properly.\n\n\"I need to train really hard in the off-season if I want to have a chance of making this count for next year. But it's definitely given me a boost going into the off-season.\"\n\nAndy Murray speaks to the media the day after winning the Davis Cup. Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images for LTA\n\nThe first major target for Murray will be the Australian Open in only seven weeks' time. The Scot reached the final for the fourth time this year but again came away on the losing side.\n\nBefore that Murray is planning to rest for 10 days before heading to Dubai for a warm-weather training block and then back home for Christmas.\n\nIt is a tight turnaround but the 28-year-old is optimistic there will not be any lingering effects going into 2016, particularly because he is not planning to play any events in February while he takes time away for the birth of his first child.\n\nMurray said: \"I just need to make sure I get the rest right now because I've played so much tennis. If I do rest, it's not like I'm going to lose all of the match fitness that I've built up over this year.\n\n\"I've played more matches this year than any other year and my body's responded really well to it, which is good. In February I know that I'm not going to be playing any events.\n\n\"I can rest now, start training for Australia and give everything I've got there and then I know I get a break. It might not be so much of a break but I'll be away from the court for a few weeks.\"\n\n\"To play and win a Davis Cup final with your brother is great. I'm really proud of him.\" Andy Murray\n\nWriting in his BBC Sport column, Murray also revealed the cause of what appeared to be a fraternal spat during his singles rubber against Belgium's David Goffin on Sunday.\n\nMurray teamed up with brother Jamie to win the doubles clash on Saturday but was then seen gesturing angrily in his sibling's direction as he battled to secure the title for Britain a day later.\n\n\"To play and win a Davis Cup final with your brother is great,\" Murray wrote. \"I'm really proud of him. What he was doing standing in my line of vision during Sunday's match though, I have no idea!\n\n\"I just saw him standing in the entrance at the corner of the court at one point and found it more off-putting because it was my brother, rather than someone I don't know. I generally try to avoid eye contact with him altogether during matches.\n\n\"Some players might find it beneficial to look over at their family but when they're right there, you see when they're stressed or nervous or pumped, and because you know them, you know what their expressions mean. I'd just rather Jamie wasn't in my eye-line at that moment, so I let him know!\"\n\nMurray described the achievement of winning Britain's first Davis Cup for 79 years as the most emotional of his career and was keen to ensure it was properly celebrated.\n\nHe told the Press Association of the celebrations: \"It was good. We all stayed in the hotel and all of our friends and family came round and we were just in a room in the hotel lobby.\n\n\"A lot of the fans that came over were staying in this hotel or hotels nearby so they were in the bar area and we got to chat and spend a bit of time with them as well, so it was really nice.\"\n\nThe Press Association contributed to this report.", "New Orleans Saints RB Tim Hightower so grateful for second chance, he": "NEW ORLEANS -- Tim Hightower couldn\u2019t sleep Sunday night. And he couldn\u2019t help but share the excitement and adrenaline that were still brimming over after he ran for 122 yards and two touchdowns in the New Orleans Saints' 38-27 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nThe 29-year-old has found new life in the NFL after more than three years out of the league. And he insisted that he\u2019s not taking a moment of it for granted.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep last night ..... Just so humbled and thankful for everything,\u201d Hightower posted in a Twitter message shortly after 6 a.m. on Monday morning. \u201cThis has been a true journey that has tested me in every way and I love it and am thankful for it. I needed every lesson, every bit of courage, strength, wisdom and resolve.... I needed forgiveness, love for myself and my family, love for God.... I needed faith beyond anything I could have ever seen physically.... I\u2019m just amazed at how blessed I am and how good God has been to me.....\n\n\u201cTo have a positive impact on my family, community and so many I love means more to me than any accolade or dollar amount. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t give up....

Hingle/USA TODAY Sports\n\nHightower said Monday that the feeling he had this week was even different than when he played in his first game in November or had his first big breakout performance two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a nervous feeling at all, it wasn\u2019t an anxious feeling. I was just so excited. I wanted to get back to work,\u201d Hightower said. \u201cWhen you have an opportunity like this that I\u2019ve been given, you just want to take advantage of it. You don\u2019t want it to end.\n\n\u201cI was just so thankful and so excited going to sleep, and I just kept thinking about what I could have done better and, \u2018What could I do next week to get better?\u2019\"\n\nHightower, who began his career with the Arizona Cardinals and Washington Redskins from 2008-11, tore his ACL with the Redskins in 2011. He tried to come back the next summer but didn\u2019t discover until a year later that an infection was stunting his recovery. He finally got a chance to return to the NFL when the Saints signed him this past January. He didn\u2019t make the team at first but returned after an injury to backup Khiry Robinson.\n\nNow, Hightower has emerged as New Orleans\u2019 leading man over the past three weeks after an injury to Mark Ingram. He has delivered in a big way, with 261 rushing yards, three rushing touchdowns and 98 receiving yards.\n\nHis 30 touches and 169 yards from scrimmage Sunday were both career highs.\n\nSaints coach Sean Payton said the idea of Hightower being a feel-good story didn\u2019t influence the decision to sign him in January or bring him back in November. But he said the team knew he would be a low-risk pickup with potentially high reward. And his character and attitude have been great pluses.\n\nHightower waited at the locker room entrance and hugged his teammates one by one after his big performance in a win at Tampa Bay two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cIt comes up probably in every offseason for teams, where you\u2019re looking at a player who\u2019s wanting an opportunity, who at one time excelled at his position and ... usually from injury had setbacks,\u201d Payton said. \u201cTim was obviously very well-regarded as a running back at Arizona and Washington before the injury. And then having a chance when he\u2019s in the offseason program to get to know him and see how important it was to him. You don\u2019t root for guys, but certainly you understand and appreciate his demeanor and work ethic.\n\n\u201cAnd even at the start of the season, we had to release him and then re-sign him, so he\u2019s had a long path. And yet every step of the way, man, he\u2019s intent on getting better, the way he prepares. I mean if you ask the players that play with him, he\u2019s a consummate pro.\n\n\u201cI think the world of him and certainly respect the fight he has [gone through] to get back on the field.\u201d", "Charles Woodson describes the start of a bittersweet final week in a diary for ESPN": "Raiders safety Charles Woodson will conclude his 18-year career on Sunday. The nine-time Pro Bowler -- the only person in NFL history to record at least 50 interceptions and 20 sacks in a career -- has agreed to share thoughts during his final week. Following is the first installment, submitted Monday night.\n\nThe alarm was set for 6 a.m., but like most mornings I was awake before it went off. My first thought wasn't football. It was the drive. It's 40 minutes from my house in Danville to the training complex in Alameda, and since I'm not too fond of driving any type of distance, 40 minutes feels long to me.\n\nI like to listen to the news on my way to work. That's where I catch up on current affairs or make phone calls if I need to. I listen to CNN or MSNBC a lot, so I know what's going on around the world. There are so many things happening, as far as the terrorist attacks and whatnot, I want to keep myself aware. You're in a bubble a lot of times in the NFL, so you're kind of removed from everything that's happening in the real world, like, the shootings in Chicago. The story that stuck with me this morning was Tamir Rice, the young boy who pulled out a plastic toy gun and ended up being shot to death by the police, and how the grand jury didn't indict the officers. That was a big one for me today.\n\nI wanted to make it business as usual when I arrived at the facility. It was important to go through my everyday routine and keep things the same because I still have work to do. My NFL portrait is not finished yet, and it won't be until this last game is over. But it was on my mind. It crossed my mind every moment I was out there. It was like, everything I do now -- going to meetings, special-teams period, getting in the hot tub, getting in the cold tub, maybe the steam room -- this'll be the last week that I do it. This week when I heat and steam on my shoulder and knee and groin, I'll be thinking about how this would be the last week I will do it.\n\nWhile I'm sitting there, a part of me is experiencing -- let me see if I can find the word -- it's a little bit of apprehension because I'm 39 years old and I've been playing some type of organized football since I was 6, and I know this is going to be my last week doing it. But at the same time there's a part of me that's happy because I was able to do it my way and leave the game the way I wanted to leave it.\n\nThe funny thing about it is, I don't know that I can actually explain what it was that led me to say it's time to retire.\n\nIt's been about 18 years since Woodson played his final game at Michigan, the Rose Bowl in 1998. AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill\n\nI woke up the morning of the Detroit game and, almost immediately, I was like, This is it. Why? What hit me in that moment? I guess I felt like if somebody would've called and said, \"C-Wood, the weather's so bad around the city, nobody can get anywhere, and the game's actually been canceled,\" I would've been all right with it. I've never felt that way about being in a game before. Never in my life on game day did I feel like I would be cool with it if the game wasn't played. To feel like that on a Sunday, I knew it was time. It just hit me out of the blue.\n\nWhen I was a young player, I used to always say to myself that I would see retirement coming, that I would know exactly when I'm going to do it. Back then, I always said it was going to be during training camp because I hated training camp and the two-a-day practices. But training camp is so easy now, I knew it wouldn't hit me then.\n\nI had a lot of people reach out to me when I made my announcement, but the moments that meant the most to me came inside the facility. When I first called owner Mark Davis and informed him that this was going to be my last year, he kind of chuckled like, \"No way, man.\" It was almost like, \"I'm not letting you retire. You're playing too well, and you've got to come back next year.\" That meant a lot to me, for the owner to want me to come back, being that I'm 39. Then talking to general manager Reggie McKenzie, and him saying how he felt about me as a player, just telling me that I played the game the right way and it was a joy to watch me play, that meant a lot. He said how when I was a free agent the first time and he was in Green Bay, he had to have me; then when he arrived in Oakland, he felt he had to have me again. And then coach Jack Del Rio, who told me, \"Charles, I feel like you're doing it the right way.\"\n\nSomebody asked me today what's the difference between my last college game and this being my last NFL game. The one difference is that there is nothing after this game. There isn't another level to the game I can go to as a player. There's finality with this game that hasn't been a part of any other game I've ever been in. We were out there running today, doing our conditioning, and Derek Carr was like, \"Wood, these are going to be your last tempos.\" He was right about one thing -- this will be my last time running tempos as an NFL player.\n\nI was trying not to think about it, but it's there. Each day there's going to be something that I'm doing for the last time. Bittersweet. That's probably the best way to describe it.\n\nESPN senior writer Jim Trotter assisted Woodson.", "Marlen Esparza has moved on after Olympic trials loss": "RENO, Nev. -- There were a lot of tears after 2012 Olympic bronze medalist Marlen Esparza was eliminated from the U.S. Olympic trials at the end of October. And many other emotions as well.\n\n\"The first week or two, I was still thinking it was a joke [that I didn't qualify]. It just didn't make any sense to me. It still doesn't, no matter how I cut it,\" Esparza said. \"I went through the stages of depression. The crying. The 'blame everyone.' The anger. Then it was just being sad. And then it was time to move on.\"\n\nEditor's Picks Caple: Getting to Rio tough on boxing hopefuls In other Olympic sports, if you beat everyone in your class in qualifying, you go to Rio. Not in boxing. Winning in the U.S. might not get you into the Olympics.\n\nBoxing is undisputed champ of sports movies U.S. Olympic hopefuls think \"Creed\" is a worthy addition to the canon of great boxing movies. Fans and the academy agree: No other sport is better suited for Hollywood, Jim Caple writes.\n\nCaple: Donation program 'sheds light' on athletes' financial plight The current Team USA Registry program is helping raise money for Olympic hopefuls, while \"shedding a light\" on the financial strains of trying to reach an Olympic Games. 2 Related\n\nAnd move on, she has. While the Rio Olympics are not a possibility this summer, Esparza won the 106-pound championship Thursday night at this week's women's world trial, which coincides with the U.S. men's Olympic trials being held here as well. So up next is the world championships in May in Kazakhstan. She will be going for her second world title after winning in 2014.\n\n\"To me the worlds are harder than the Olympics,\" Esparza said. \"The worlds are like the Olympics. There are top girls at the Olympics, but when you get to the worlds, there are like 80 people and you have to fight for the spots. Getting into the Olympic Games is the hard part. Once you're there, you know who it is you're fighting and you can prepare for them. It's not always relaxed because the pressure is that much more intense at the Olympics, but as far as the competition goes, if you're able to block out the pressure, the competition is actually less than at worlds.\n\n\"When I won worlds [in 2014] it was a lot more satisfying than the Olympics.\"\n\nEsparza knows all too well how difficult it can be getting into Olympics after her upset loss at the U.S. trials. She also has found out that being eliminated from the 2016 Olympics hasn't been as bad as she thought as first. And in some ways, it has actually been helpful.\n\n\"Luckily, nobody dropped me in my endorsements. I still have a medal and they like me as a person,\" she said. \"I didn't expect that, so that was something good. My team still stuck around me. I found out who my friends are and aren't. And I just decided to keep doing what I love to do without all the pressure. Which is kind of ironic.\n\n\"But I'm having a lot more fun because I don't have to freak out about everything. If I lose, but if I can learn from it, I can be where I am -- happy and have a happy face and not be so freaked out. And I can sleep at night. I was getting anxiety attacks and panic attacks. Those have been resolved.\"", "Rory McIlroy named European Tour golfer of the year": "Rory McIlroy has been named the European Tour's golfer of the year, claiming the award for the third time in four years.\n\nThe world No. 3, whose season was severely disrupted by an ankle injury this summer, claimed three European titles in 2015, including a thrilling victory at the DP World Tour Championship, Dubai last month, where he successfully defended his Race to Dubai crown.\n\nMcIlroy finished the season 1,056,943 points ahead of nearest rival Danny Willett in the Race to Dubai, becoming only the seventh player in the history of the Tour to claim the year-end European No.1 spot in consecutive campaigns.\n\n\"It is a huge honour for me to be named European Tour golfer of the year again,\" McIlroy told the European Tour's official website. \"I feel very proud to have won this prestigious award for the third time - it is always special, no matter how often, to be recognised this way.\n\n\"After a good first half to the season, the injury was obviously a setback for me, so to finish the year strongly with my second victory in Dubai -- plus picking up the Race to Dubai title again -- was very satisfying.\n\n\"This was an objective I successfully fulfilled this season. To now win the golfer of the year award, too, is a great way to sign off the year. I am already looking forward to starting the new season and trying to achieve even more in 2016.\"\n\nDubai proved a fruitful hunting ground for McIlroy in 2015, with his first victory of the season coming at the Dubai Desert Classic, while his second of the campaign came across the Atlantic at the WGC-Cadillac Match Play.\n\nThe Northern Irishman then suffered a serious ankle injury while playing football with friends in July, ruling him out of the Scottish Open and the defence of his Open Championship crown at St Andrews.\n\nAfter an intense period of rehabilitation, McIlroy returned to action just five weeks later, by which time Willett had cut his Race to Dubai lead to just 1,613 points. However, McIlroy shook off the pressure to claim the season finale by a single shot from another Englishman, Andy Sullivan, on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates last month.", "Gary Russell, Antonio Vargas, Paul Kroll advance after boxing trials": "RENO, Nev. -- When Gary Russell lost in his first bout at the U.S. Olympic men's boxing trials Monday, he fell into the challengers/losers bracket of the double-elimination tournament. In order to keep his Olympic dreams alive, he would have to fight in each of the next six days and, of course, win all six of those bouts. He later looked up how many boxers had pulled off that challenge. There weren't many.\n\nOnly four previous boxers had fought their way through the losers bracket at the U.S. trials to reach the Olympics, and the names are both inspiring and daunting: Floyd Mayweather, Evander Holyfield, Roy Jones Jr. and Russell's older brother, current WBC welterweight champion Gary Russell, Jr.\n\nBut there may be some more names joining that elite list, including the youngest Gary Russell, 19, who completed his U.S. trials comeback this week by winning the light welterweight division Sunday. \"I feel like I'm following in good footsteps,\" he said.\n\nEditor's Picks Caple: Back to reality for U.S. amateur boxers Fighting at the U.S. Olympic men's boxing trials this week wasn't easy. But if you're an amateur boxer, life doesn't necessarily get an easier after the event.\n\nCaple: Esparza has moved on after trials loss A month and a half after her stunning upset at the U.S. Olympic boxing trials, Marlen Esparza has recovered from the defeat and picked up where she left off. 1 Related\n\nHe wasn't the only one following those footsteps. Fellow challengers bracket boxers Antonio Vargas and Paul Kroll also won their respective flyweight and welterweight divisions Sunday. When told how few boxers had survived the losers bracket to make the Olympic team, and that Mayweather and Holyfield were two of them, Vargas stood silently for several seconds with a stunned look in his eyes.\n\n\"Man, I'm speechless,\" he said finally. \"I don't know what to say. God gave me the strength and the will to go in there. After my first loss, I felt like I got cheated. I wanted to give up. I asked, 'God, why did you do this?' But he gave me the strength and the will to persevere and get through this, and that's exactly what I did.\"\n\nThe three boxers haven't quite joined that elite group yet, though. Olympic boxing rules require that all U.S. trials winners must also finish high enough at one of three international tournaments to qualify for Rio. \"The job isn't done yet,\" Russell said. \"We have to keep pushing.\"\n\nThe trio aren't alone in the push. In the only other match of the day, Nico Hernandez beat Leroy Davila to win the light flyweight class. Hernandez had advanced through the winners bracket, but lost to Davila on Saturday night to force the Sunday box-off. \"Last night wasn't my night,\" Hernandez said. \"I went back to my room and thought about things I needed to correct and I corrected them.\"\n\nSunday's four winners join the five division champs from Saturday night: super heavyweight Marlo Moore, heavyweight Cam Awesome, light heavyweight Jonathan Esquivel, middleweight Charles Conwell and bantamweight Shakur Stevenson. All will try to reach the Olympics and become the first U.S. male boxing medalists since Deontay Wilder in 2008.\n\nRussell said that while Mayweather and Holyfield are people who inspired him, \"My family inspired me and impacted me in a more powerful way.\n\n\"We talked every night, every second of every single day as a unit, me, my brother and my father,\" he said. \"We all came together and put our heads together and came up with how we were going to achieve this. Accomplish, execute, conquer.\"\n\nRussell Jr. said he couldn't explain why so few fighters have been able to reach the Olympics through the challengers bracket. He said the reason he and his younger brother were able to do so was because, \"It's in our blood, in our DNA.\"\n\nAlthough Russell Jr. was on the U.S. team in 2008, he was not able to compete after collapsing while trying to make weight. Perhaps the younger Gary will fare better; he, Vargas and Kroll already showed they are able to overcome a very tough challenges.\n\n\"He is the Last of the Mohicans,\" Russell Jr. said of his young brother. \"He has the advantage to be able to see all of the mistakes and all the things that we have done as his older brothers and be able to capitalize on it and benefit from it. I'm pleased he's been paying attention and listening.\"", "Rafael dos Anjos cements P4P status": "The final UFC event of 2015 delivered a bang over the weekend in central Florida. Nate Diaz made a most-welcome return to the Octagon, Alistair Overeem might have (at last) earned a shot at a heavyweight title and Rafael dos Anjos cemented his place atop the lightweight division with a stunning 66-second knockout against Donald Cerrone.\n\nLet's dive into the individual performances of the event with ESPN's Report Card.\n\nRafael dos Anjos\n\nUFC on FOX (lightweight championship)\n\nDefeated Donald Cerrone (TKO1/1:06)\n\nIt's time to stop overlooking dos Anjos -- but we'll see if that happens. Pound-for-pound, he's right up there with the absolute best in the sport. For some reason, seeing his name with Demetrious Johnson and Jon Jones is still a trip, but he has proven himself as nothing short of world class. No single aspect of his game stands out the most, because it's all airtight at this point. His speed is a problem. His pressure is a problem. The right hook, offensive grappling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu -- it's all there. He's not a great sound byte and never will be, but no opponent will overlook him moving forward. For some reason, I don't think Conor McGregor will be his next opponent, but dos Anjos has the lightweight belt and \"Mystic Mac\" wants it.\n\nNate Diaz\n\nUFC on FOX (lightweights)\n\nDefeated Michael Johnson (UD)\n\n#Needlemover. This was a great performance, albeit against an opponent who was willing to meet Diaz in the pocket and fight his fight. Either way, this is how to do it. And what Diaz says about his future makes sense. What motivation is there for him to \"get in line\" and angle for a title shot? He has been doing that for 11 years. That's how the game works but ... he's famous and a fan favorite, belt or no belt. I think at this point, you treat his matchmaking a little different to acknowledge that. Diaz is only 30. Give the guy big fights he will get up for. Because a motivated Diaz is the Diaz we want to see. Not the \"waiting in line for a title shot\" Diaz.\n\nMichael Johnson\n\nUFC on FOX (lightweights)\n\nLost to Nate Diaz (UD)\n\nHad the decision gone Johnson's way, I wouldn't have called it a robbery. Diaz landed more total punches and it seemed as though his straight left was consistently the hardest punch of the night, but Johnson continued to walk through it and put himself in position to win. That reach disadvantage he dealt with was tough. He needed to be aggressive, but anytime he came up short, he was exposed for Diaz's counters. And if he needed to step back and regroup, he was on the end of Diaz's punches. I didn't think his game plan was wrong and I didn't think he should have turned to his wrestling. He turned in a solid performance, Diaz just gave a better one.\n\nAlistair Overeem\n\nUFC on FOX (heavyweights)\n\nDefeated Junior dos Santos (TKO2/4:43)\n\nThe Orlando, Florida, crowd didn't feel this fight, nor (I'm guessing) did many at home. (I even had a little fun describing the lack of action on Twitter.) Truth is though, this was absolutely the correct approach for Overeem. He essentially dominated the fight -- we're just not used to calling a performance \"dominant\" when it looks this way. Overeem rendered one of the most feared strikers in the sport harmless. His stance switches and feints completely threw dos Santos' timing off. Plus, he executed this kind of game plan in his last contracted fight with the UFC, meaning he was likely under some additional pressure. I'm down with Overeem in a title fight.\n\nTamdan McCrory\n\nUFC on FOX (middleweights)\n\nDefeated Josh Samman (Sub3/4:10)\n\nIt was a pretty sweet return to the Octagon for \"The Barncat,\" who hadn't fought in the UFC since August 2009. Simplest way to say it: McCrory is a joy to watch on the ground. He basically dominated Samman, who isn't exactly known for a slick ground game but is nevertheless solid in that aspect. Samman can grind, he's athletic and has been good at dragging opponents into deep waters. McCrory made him look like a novice on the floor, which is no easy task. After disappearing from the sport for five years, McCrory has somehow been stringing together the best performances of his career since resurfacing with Bellator in September 2014.\n\nKamaru Usman\n\nUFC on FOX (welterweights)\n\nDefeated Leon Edwards (UD)\n\nWhen watching this 27-year-old, one should keep in mind he has only been training MMA since 2012. Of course his overall game needs refinement, but there's evidence of a potential breakout. Facing a quality striker in Edwards, Usman was expected to lean on his wrestling and he did so. But he was effective when he trusted his hands and you can tell having confidence in his stand-up is a work in progress for him. He showed composure when Edwards landed hard shots early and didn't crack when Edwards showcased some very good takedown defense. It might take some time, but Usman is worth keeping an eye on.\n\nNate Marquardt\n\nUFC on FOX (middleweights)\n\nDefeated CB Dollaway (KO2/0:28)\n\nIt's tough to grade Marquardt at this point because, in reality, this is probably the best performance he's capable of. He did a decent job of mixing up distances, preventing Dollaway from taking full advantage of his size. His offense was limited until the one-punch knockout blow though and his durability continues to look pretty questionable. He's a veteran and (clearly) still capable of taking advantage of an opponent's error, but that's about it. The wheels fell off for Marquardt awhile back and, unfortunately, this win doesn't mean they're completely back on.\n\nCharles Oliveira\n\nUFC on FOX (featherweights)\n\nDefeated Myles Jury (Sub1/3:05)\n\nOliveira's quick submission against Jury was practically flawless, but his overall grade drops to average because he missed weight by four pounds. As I've said a million times, it's not like I'm in favor of guys cutting a ridiculous amount of weight. I understand how difficult it is. But this is the weight class Oliveira has chosen to fight in and it's now the third time he has missed weight. This is still a nice win, but Oliveira's up there calling out the champion in his weight class and he can't even make weight better than 70 percent of the time as a featherweight. No Charles. Sorry.\n\nNik Lentz\n\nUFC on FOX (lightweights)\n\nDefeated Danny Castillo (SD)\n\nIf Lentz needed to be \"carried to the scale\" as a featherweight (as he said after the fight), then 100 percent he needs to be at 155. But as far as performances go, this return to the lightweight division wasn't his best. The pace was pretty high -- and he also said he suffered a knee injury early -- but not to the point you'd expect Lentz to gas by the second round. He continually employed the \"guillotine takedown defense strategy\" when Castillo shot, which meant he regularly gave him top position. In a close fight, that could have been huge. Lentz mostly imposed his will on the feet and deserved the win, but looked pretty bad in the process.\n\nJunior dos Santos\n\nUFC on FOX (heavyweights)\n\nLost to Alistair Overeem (TKO2/4:43)\n\nFirst off, the stoppage was fine. Yes, dos Santos was trying to stand as it was called, but he was doing so in a defenseless way. And when he fell backwards from that left hand, it was obvious to anyone in the building, let alone the referee standing four feet away, that he went out. Dos Santos is too tough for his own good. If we could go back in time and have his second and third fights against Cain Velasquez stopped earlier, would we not all want that? Because he was never knocked out, it led to him taken a considerable amount of damage. I didn't need to see Saturday's fight go on any longer than it did. And in terms of his performance, he looked tentative and slower than he has previously. He has always been relatively one-dimensional and when opponents have been able to deal with that one dimension, dos Santos has not looked good.\n\nCB Dollaway\n\nUFC on FOX (middleweights)\n\nLost to Nate Marquardt (KO2/0:28)\n\nHate to pile on Dollaway, but the fact is, he kind of had to find a way to lose this fight and that's what he did. But can't really blame him for getting greedy looking for a finish. It had been 19 months since his last victory and he smelled blood in that second round. But he has been doing this long enough not to charge in, leading with his chin, hands at his waist. He knows better. This is a bad loss, that's all there is to it.\n\nDonald Cerrone\n\nUFC on FOX (lightweight championship)\n\nLost to Rafael dos Anjos (TKO1/1:06)\n\nWhat happened? We can speculate all day, but we'll probably never know. Consensus says the best \"Cowboy\" is a happy, lighthearted \"Cowboy\" and the Cerrone who walked to the Octagon on Saturday looked, to me, less than lighthearted. He looked reminiscent of the serious, slow-starting Cerrone who lost previous title fights during his WEC days. It's hard to say, though. Cerrone displayed nothing but confidence going into the fight. He got caught early. Dos Anjos is proving to be a special talent in the sport now. Who knows? It was tough to see, as Cerrone's positive, carefree frame of mind had truly become one of the best stories to follow in MMA. Hopefully this loss doesn't affect him long-term.", "Harlem Globetrotter legend Meadowlark Lemon, 83, dies": "ESPN's Ian Fitzsimmons and Mike Golic share their memories of Globetrotters legend Meadowlark Lemon, who passed away at the age of 83.

Bunn Award in 2003 for his outstanding lifetime contributions to basketball.\n\nHe played for the Globetrotters during the team's heyday from the mid-1950s to the late-1970s, delighting fans with his skills with a ball and a joke. Traveling by car, bus, train or plane nearly every night, Lemon covered nearly 4 million miles to play in front of popes and presidents, kings and queens. He averaged 325 games per year during his prime, that luminous smile never dimming.\n\n\"Meadowlark was the most sensational, awesome, incredible basketball player I've ever seen,\" NBA great and former Globetrotter Wilt Chamberlain said shortly before his death in 1999. \"People would say it would be Dr. J or even [Michael] Jordan. For me, it would be Meadowlark Lemon.\"\n\n\"Anytime someone that was a pioneer or anyone that has given so much to the game kind of releases from our brotherhood and our fraternity, it's definitely a sad day, so prayers and best wishes to the family,\" LeBron James said.\n\nThe Globetrotters said on Twitter that they'd dedicate the team's 90th anniversary tour to Lemon and former teammate and fellow Hall of Famer Marques Haynes, who died in May.\n\nDuring his time with the team, Lemon appeared in movies, including \"The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh\"; several television shows and specials, including \"ABC's Wide World of Sports,\" \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"The Harlem Globetrotters Popcorn Machine\"; an animated version of Lemon also appeared on \"The Harlem Globetrotters\" cartoon series and on episodes of \"Scooby Doo.\"\n\nHe was one of the most popular athletes in the world during the prime of his career, thanks to a unique blend of athleticism and showmanship.\n\nPlaying against the team's nightly foil, the Washington Generals, Lemon left fans in awe with an array of hook shots and no-look passes, and with the nifty moves he displayed during the Globetrotters' famous circle while \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" played over the loudspeaker.\n\nShaquille O'Neal was among those reacting to the news of Lemon's death on Twitter.\n\nThe Great Meadowlark Lemon of the legendary Harlem Globetrotters dies at 83.

Fran Fraschilla (@franfraschilla) December 28, 2015\n\nLemon also had a knack for sending the fans home with a smile every night, whether it was with his running commentary, putting confetti in a water bucket or pulling down the pants of an \"unsuspecting\" referee.\n\n\"We played serious games too, against the Olympic teams and the College All-Stars,\" Lemon said. \"But that didn't stop us from putting the comedy in there.\"\n\nHe also was awarded with the International Clown Hall of Fame's Lifetime of Laughter Award in 2000.\n\nLemon left the Globetrotters in 1978 over a contract dispute and thereafter formed his own traveling teams -- the Meadowlark Lemon's Bucketeers, the Shooting Stars and Meadowlark Lemon's Harlem All-Stars -- as he continued to play well into his 70s.\n\nHe later formed Scottsdale-based Meadowlark Lemon Ministries, traveling the country to provide a message of faith to children in basketball camps and youth prisons.\n\nAside from Lemon's No. 36, other Globetrotters to have their numbers retired are Wilt Chamberlain (13), Fred \"Curly\" Neal (22), Haynes (20) and Reece \"Goose\" Tatum (50). Washington Generals founder Red Klotz also had his number retired.\n\nBorn in 1932, Meadow George Lemon III -- he lengthened his name after joining the Globetrotters -- didn't have money for a basketball when he was young, so he rigged up a makeshift hoop in his backyard in Wilmington, N.C. Using a coat hanger and onion sack for the basket, he made his first shot with an empty milk can.\n\nLemon first contacted the Globetrotters before his high school graduation and joined the team in 1954. He missed a game in 1955 because of a bad bowl of goulash in Germany, but that was the last one he sat out. What followed was a run, by his calculations, of more than 16,000 straight games that took him to places he never could have imagined.\n\n\"I was one of the most fortunate athletes that ever lived,\" he said. \"I was able to watch history.\"\n\nThe Associated Press and ESPN's Dave McMenamin contributed to this report.", "Daniel Murphy brings solid hitting, defensive struggles to Nationals": "What are the Washington Nationals getting with the addition of Daniel Murphy, with whom they reportedly agreed to a three-year contract on Thursday?\n\nMurphy is coming off a whirlwind postseason in which he homered in a record six straight games and set a postseason record for home runs by a second baseman with seven. But in the World Series, Murphy regressed, hitting .150 as Royals pitchers repeatedly jammed him inside, and he made a key error in a Game 4 loss.\n\nMurphy\u2019s strength is not hitting for power (he has never hit more than 14 home runs in a regular season), but hitting for average. He has hit .280 or better in each of his past five seasons, posting an above-average OPS+ (OPS compared to league average, accounting for ballpark) in each one.\n\nMurphy is more a doubles hitter than home run hitter. His 153 doubles over the past four seasons are tied for fourth-most in the majors. He\u2019s the only player with at least 37 doubles in each of the past four seasons.\n\nMurphy added another wrinkle to his game in 2015: In an era in which the strikeout is common, he became almost impossible to strike out. He had the most at-bats per strikeout (13.1) of any batting-title qualifier in the majors. Murphy had struck out 82, 95 and 86 times in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. He cut that to 38 in 499 at-bats last season.\n\nClutch hitting might not be a repeatable skill, but Murphy has provided timely hits throughout his career. He has hit at least .290 with runners in scoring position every season in his career, including .309 in 2015. His .314 batting average with runners in scoring position and two outs ranks seventh since the start of the 2009 season (the year Murphy made his debut).\n\nDefensive shortcomings\n\nYet despite this, Murphy has posted fewer than 2.0 wins above replacement in each of the past four seasons and in all but one season in his career. This is due to some of his defensive issues at second base.\n\nMurphy\u2019s minus-40 defensive runs saved at second base over the last four seasons rank second-worst in baseball (Rickie Weeks is at minus-62). He\u2019ll be a defensive downgrade for the Nationals, who got more defensive runs saved from their second basemen last season (8) than any other team in the National League.\n\nDid you know?\n\nPrior to Murphy's streak of six consecutive games with a home run, he had homered in consecutive games once in his seven-year career (903 games).", "Roger Federer's major risk": "Roger Federer never attended college, but he's planning the mother of all spring breaks in 2016, a de facto offseason that will be well over a month longer than the year-end one he's taking now.\n\nIt's a breathtakingly bold move by Federer, the men's all-time leader in Grand Slam singles titles, seemingly designed to best spare -- and prepare -- him for the challenge of the Olympic Games in Rio. Federer has yet to plug the one outstanding hole in his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with a singles gold medal, despite having taken part in four editions of the Olympics. He did, however, take silver in London, losing to Andy Murray, and he partnered with Stan Wawrinka to earn doubles gold in Beijing.\n\nThe tennis portion of the Olympic competition begins Aug. 8 on hard courts comparable to the surface used at the summer North American Masters 1000 events. That helps explain why Federer decided to cut the spring Euroclay circuit entirely off his schedule.\n\nRoger Federer hopes his scheduling decision will pay off at the Rio Olympics. Paul Drinkwater/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images\n\nBy the time Rio rolls around, Federer's spring break will be long forgotten. He'll have logged two Grand Slams in the French Open and Wimbledon, plus the Toronto Masters 1000, the major rehearsal for Rio.\n\nThat's where the risk factor comes into play.\n\nRankings for a veteran such as Federer are critical because they create the seedings. And one of Federer's major goals for the Rio Games must be to keep his ranking high enough to keep his fellow Big Four members at arm's length in the draw.\n\nFederer is presently No. 3, but No. 4 Wawrinka and No. 5 Rafael Nadal are real threats to his position in 2016. Tomas Berdych is always in the mix, as are Kei Nishikori, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, David Ferrer, Milos Raonic, Marin Cilic and even Richard Gasquet.\n\nFederer's spring hiatus will begin whenever he finishes at the Indian Wells Masters, which starts March 7, and it will end with the start of the French Open on May 22. It will be bought partly at the expense of the Miami Masters, which Federer is skipping again, and the entire clay-court season leading up to Roland Garros. That stretch includes a whopping three Masters events: Monte Carlo, Madrid and Rome.\n\nBy eliminating the spring clay events, however, Federer has room to add two events, Rotterdam (indoor hard) and Stuttgart (grass). Both tournaments will give Federer an opportunity to add ranking points to replace the ones he will automatically lose when he fails to defend them in places such as Rome and Monte Carlo.\n\nIn all, Federer will play 16 events in 2016: a dozen on hard courts, three on grass and just Roland Garros on clay.\n\nBecause of his age, record and history of service, Federer is not bound by the same rules as most of his ATP peers. He can skip Masters 1000 events that are mandatory for almost everyone else without incurring punishment that might affect his ranking. However, while Federer has his feet up, he will also be seeing the rankings points he gained during each week in 2015 melt away, and he'll be unable to replace or even add to them.\n\nWhatever else happens, Federer will be losing 950 points when he skips the Euroclay season. That's nearly the amount awarded to the winner of a Masters 1000. Worse yet, he doesn't have an enormous amount to gain and salt away for insurance early in the year; he's defending winner's points in Brisbane and Dubai, where he beat Novak Djokovic this past year, and finalist's points at Indian Wells.\n\nFederer was upset in the third round of the Australian Open in 2015, so he can add a significant number of points by going a few more rounds in Melbourne. He's also playing Rotterdam for the first time, which means all the points there will be gravy.\n\nIf Federer has a strong start in 2016, he is likely to be in good shape rankingswise after his long break. But if he loses a lot of ground, he'll go into Roland Garros and Wimbledon feeling a lot of pressure to repeat his respective quarterfinal and runner-up performances. The addition of Stuttgart also will give him a chance to pick up points on his best grass surface, but Stuttgart is just an ATP 250.\n\nThe message in Federer's schedule for 2016 is clear: It's all about the Olympics. This man has no desire to depose the King of Clay. In fact, he doesn't even want to live in that kingdom.", "Toyota head Akio Toyoda resigns from Tokyo Olympic committee": "TOKYO -- The head of Toyota Motor Corp. stepped down Monday as vice president of the organizing committee for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as organizers acknowledged the cost of hosting the Games will be far higher than originally thought.\n\nThe committee said Akio Toyoda is expected to be replaced by the president of Panasonic, Kazuhiro Tsuga.\n\nOrganizers said Toyoda may have been concerned about serving on both committees, as the Olympic body is seeking support from the business community. Toyota Motor is a major sponsor of the Olympics.\n\n\"Mr. Toyoda might have tried to sort out his roles,\" Tokyo organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto told reporters.\n\nToyoda said in a statement that he decided to reorganize his roles to intensify his efforts to encourage business support for the 2020 Games. He said he is \"looking forward to forging even closer ties between the organizing committee and Japan's business community.\"\n\nAlso Monday, Muto said the cost of the Games will be much higher than the original estimate of just over 300 billion yen ($2.5 billion), though he did not give a specific figure, saying officials are still sorting out and compiling cost estimates.\n\nMuto denied recent media reports that the latest overall cost estimate has soared to 1.8 trillion yen ($15 billion), saying comparing numbers without specific breakdowns is \"inappropriate.\"\n\nJapan's national broadcaster NHK said the increase mainly came from previously unanticipated costs, including 300 billion yen ($2.48 billion) to set up temporary venues, 270 billion yen ($2.23 billion) for renting some venues, 200 billion yen ($1.65 billion) for security and 180 billion yen ($1.49 billion) for transportation and infrastructure.\n\nMuto said the initial estimate Japan provided to the International Olympic Committee was \"bare minimum\" and that costs for anti-terrorism measures, additional events, transportation, land lease and other necessities would have to be added.\n\n\"There is no doubt that a new cost estimate would swell because of the need for previously unanticipated spending such as counterterrorism measures,\" he said.\n\nTokyo Olympics organizing committee chairman and former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori has said the total cost could be as much as 2 trillion yen ($16.5 billion).\n\nMuto said the organizing committee plans to submit its latest cost estimate to the IOC by next summer.\n\nToyoda's sudden resignation and the confirmation of rising costs are the latest in a series of setbacks for the Olympic preparations. Japan had to scrap its original plans for the main stadium because of soaring costs and then faced a plagiarism scandal over the logo for the Games.\n\nA new stadium design will be announced Tuesday from two proposals after Japan canceled the original plan by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid.", "Phoenix Suns keep Jeff Hornacek, shake up staff": "Chris Broussard breaks down the struggles Jeff Hornacek and the Phoenix Suns have had this season and discusses how likely it is that Hornacek will remain coach. (1:44)\n\nThe Phoenix Suns, after a series of staff meetings Sunday, decided to shake up their coaching staff instead of ousting head coach and former veteran player Jeff Hornacek.\n\nOn Monday, the Suns promoted longtime NBA guard Earl Watson and former NBA D-League head coach Nate Bjorkgren to the bench to work closer to Hornacek and dismissed veteran assistants Mike Longabardi, who was heading up Phoenix's defense, and Jerry Sichting.\n\nEditor's Picks Pelton: What went wrong for Suns, Hornacek The Suns tried to achieve two competing goals -- win now without sacrificing the future -- and failed in both, setting the franchise back and putting Jeff Hornacek's future in question.\n\nSuns G Bledsoe needs surgery for meniscus tear Suns guard Eric Bledsoe needs surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee and will miss about six weeks. 1 Related\n\n\"It is never easy to make changes to a coaching staff in the middle of a season, but we feel Earl and Nate are ready to take the next steps in their careers and provide some creative ideas to our group,\" general manager Ryan McDonough said in a statement. \"We thank Mike and Jerry for their contributions. They are both good coaches who made significant contributions to our team winning 87 games over the previous two seasons.\"\n\nOn Sunday, ESPN first reported that the Suns' 5-15 nosedive, including a home loss Saturday night to the 2-30 Philadelphia 76ers, had put Hornacek's job under immediate threat.\n\nIt is believed that the Suns are taking this measure instead to give Hornacek, who is held in high esteem by owner Robert Sarver, another chance to turn the club around.\n\nBut that figures to be difficult after the harsh news Sunday that star guard Eric Bledsoe is out indefinitely and will require surgery Tuesday to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee.\n\nSources told ESPN that the Suns, despite the organization's well-known fondness for Hornacek, have been forced to contemplate a coaching change far sooner than they hoped because of a slide that has dropped them to 12-20 and 11th in the Western Conference. There is also a growing fear within the organization that the team is no longer responding to its head coach.\n\nPhoenix began the season with playoff aspirations after posting records of 48-34 and 39-43 in Hornacek's first two seasons, and after the offseason signing of center Tyson Chandler.\n\nThe Suns have dropped 15 of 20 games since opening 7-5, seemingly bottoming out in Saturday night's home loss to the Sixers. Sam Forencich/NBAE/Getty Images\n\nBut the Suns have dropped 15 of 20 games since opening 7-5, seemingly bottoming out in Saturday night's home loss to the Sixers as Bledsoe also exited with his knee injury in the second quarter.\n\nAdding to the sting of the Philadelphia loss: It was the first game on the Sixers' bench for former Suns coach Mike D'Antoni, who was hired recently by new Philadelphia chairman of basketball operations and former Suns owner Jerry Colangelo to serve as associate head coach to Sixers coach Brett Brown.\n\n\"Obviously, it's probably a low point for us,\" Hornacek told reporters after the game. \"Now the confidence is lacking.\"\n\nIt was Philadelphia's first road win since last March, as well as the first game of a two-game suspension for Suns forward Markieff Morris, who threw a towel in Hornacek's direction after being pulled from a home loss Wednesday to 12-18 Denver. Morris has been angling for a trade since the offseason.\n\n\"Pretty embarrassing, point blank, period,\" Suns forward P.J. Tucker told the Arizona Republic on Saturday night.\n\n\"If something doesn't change quick, it could get really ugly, really fast.\"\n\nThis is the final guaranteed season on Hornacek's original four-year contract. Questions about his future with the club have been circulating in coaching circles since the Suns elected not to pick up their team option on Hornacek for 2016-17 entering this season.", "2015 Year in Review: This game challen...": "Top 10 Streak for the Cash Moments of 2015\n\nFor the fourth year running we have pooled our favorite props, days, etc. to come up with our Top-10 moments in 2015. Tweet us @ESPNStreak to let us know what we got right and what we missed!\n\n#10 - Charles in Charge?\n\nDate: September 17th, 2015\n\nProp: NFL (Broncos @ Chiefs): How many DIFFERENT PLAYERS will SCORE a TD in the 2nd Half? (No OT)\n\nOptions:\n\n2 or Fewer\n\n3 or More\n\nHow it all went down: This is the first time you'll see Peyton on our list, but it won't be the last. Somehow he finds himself amidst all the Streak madness year in and year out. In Week 2 the Chiefs hosted the Broncos and an ugly, defensive affair ensued for most of the 2nd Half. No TDs in the 3rd Quarter made the under look like a given, especially when the first one didn't come until 2:27 left in the game when Knile Davis skirted his way into the end zone. Denver, now trailing by 7, needed a last-minute drive to take the game to OT. 2 or Under was a lock. But with 36 seconds left Manning found Emmanuel Sanders to tie the game. The extra point was good and overtime here we come. Right? For some bizarre reason the Chiefs, instead of taking a knee to get into OT, ran a play with 36 seconds left. Jamaal Charles fumbled the ball and Bradley Roby scooped it up and sprinted to the promise land, leaving the unders trailing in his wake wondering what just happened.\n\n#9 - ADHOC Madness\n\nDate: February 9th, 2015\n\nProp: ATP Rotterdam/Serie A: Which side will record a HIGHER TOTAL?\n\nOptions:\n\n#5 Dimitrov v. Mathieu: Total Games Played or Tie\n\nGenoa @ Lazio: Minute of First Goal or No Goal\n\nHow it all went down: I'm going to be honest, this was a slow sports day, so when I was sitting there on Sunday night I thought an ADHOC prop seemed like the best option to spice things up. This was one we hadn't tried before so I thought, why not? Although Mathieu was a big underdog in the match the total games o/u was 20.5, so despite 91.6% being on the soccer side we had a feeling this would be close. He broke Dimitrov and won the 1st Set 6-4, broke him again in the 2nd set but lost the set in a tiebreak. Soccer was in the 27th minute when the tennis match went to a tiebreak at 6-6, so although Mathieu failed to close the set and end the prop the soccer pickers still felt very confident at this point knowing with each passing minute there would have to be another game played in tennis to keep pace. All Mathieu had to do was win the tiebreak or the soccer game had to hit the 37th minute without a goal (because the max games at that point would be 10+13+13)- but then everything changed. The Lazio goalie Marchetti got red carded on a challenge in the box and Genoa was awarded a pk. It took him all the way until the 30th minute to score it but nonetheless soccer was now locked in at 30 and a huge underdog in the prop - someone would have to win the 3rd set 6-0 for the soccer pickers to get a green. It was a valiant effort but Dimitrov ended up winning the 3rd set 6-2, leaving the final score at 31-30 with tennis coming out victorious.\n\n#8 - Darius Slays the Stafford Pickers\n\nDate: September 27th, 2015\n\nProp: NFL (Broncos @ Lions): Which QB will record a TD PASS FIRST in the 1st Half?\n\nOptions:\n\nPeyton Manning (DEN)\n\nMatthew Stafford (DET) or Neither\n\nHow it all went down: Neither QB had really come close the entire half...it was an ugly 7-6 game with the Broncos leading at the 2 minute warning. Sensing a trend here? The Broncos won early and often in 2015, but it wasn't pretty...perhaps a sign of things yet to come down the road. Anyways, Manning pickers had a glimmer of hope as Denver was driving with the clock winding down near midfield, but on a crucial 3rd down they couldn't convert to get them into field goal range. With only 10 seconds left on the clock on 4th and 1 the Broncos decided to go for it, but instead of some sideline route to get McManus into range Manning bombed it deep to Demaryius Thomas! He caught the ball and proceeded to shed Detroit's best corner Darius Slay before walking into the end zone almost untouched with only 5 seconds left in the half to save the Manning pickers.\n\n#7 - A Royal Show at St. Andrews\n\nDate: July 20th, 2015\n\nProp: British Open: Which PAIRING will record MORE BIRDIES on Holes 15-18?\n\nOptions:\n\nLouis Oosthuizen + Paul Dunne or Tie\n\nJordan Spieth + Jason Day\n\nHow it all went down: This was a tournament to remember. Imposing conditions, a leaderboard littered with top pros and a Monday finish all unfolding at one of the most hallowed grounds in golf history. It became clear early on that the only realistic birdie opportunity in this prop was on 18 and the tie option was going to be huge. And yet, the lure of taking Day and Spieth was too good for 90% to pass up. On 16 Spieth stepped up and confidently drained a 50+ foot birdie putt (shown at 2:07 in the video above), putting him and Day up 1-0. Neither could birdie 18 so it was all down to Louis and Dunne as they headed down the stretch. What's more, Louis needed a birdie to make the playoff with Zach Johnson and Marc Leishman already in the clubhouse up 1. On 18 Dunne flew a wedge well beyond the green and eliminated himself from contention in the prop; it was all down to Louis. And, from 90 yards he put his 2nd shot to within 7 feet and left himself an excellent chance at birdie (shown at 3:58 in the video). Sure enough he nailed it to end the prop 1-1 with his group winning on the tie, also keeping him alive to win the Open Championship.\n\n#6 - Mighty Mouse Wins at the Bell\n\nDate: April 25th, 2015\n\nProp 1: UFC 186 (Demetrious Johnson v. Kyoji Horiguchi): What will be the FIGHT RESULT?\n\nOptions:\n\nDemetrious Johnson (USA): Wins By Decision\n\nAny Other Result\n\nHow it all went down: The first two rounds were back and forth with a ton of action. Johnson, who many consider the best pound for pound UFC fighter in the world, really took over in Rounds 3 and 4, but Horiguchi managed to stay in the fight. In the 5th and final round Johnson was taking down Horiguchi at will and pressing the action but still, it looked like it would go the distance with an easy decision for Johnson. He just couldn't finish the fight. With 30 seconds to go Johnson got Horiguchi in a crucifix and went to work, but time was running out. Still on the ground but with under 10 seconds left, Johnson saw an opportunity and changed mount to an arm bar. Horiguchi tapped with 1 second on the clock for the latest stoppage in UFC history. Any Other Result for the win (who doubted it?)!\n\n#5 - Who Says the NIT Can't be Exciting?\n\nDate: March 24th, 2015\n\nProp: NIT (#2 Miami (FL) @ #1 Richmond): Will BOTH TEAMS SCORE 30+ POINTS in the 2nd Half? (No OT)\n\nOptions:\n\nYes: Both teams score 30+ in 2nd Half\n\nNo: At least one team doesn't score 30+ in 2nd Half\n\nHow it all went down: The 1st Half score was 30-18 Richmond so both Miami and Richmond's 2nd Half o/u was well above 30 (35 & 34, respectively). Richmond went cold from the floor in the final 5 minutes, missing 3 3's with under 2 minutes left in the game and giving up the lead in the process. Down 61-55 with 17 seconds left the Spiders made a layup, fouled, and then made another and this time contested layup with 6 seconds left to reach exactly 29 2nd Half points (Miami had already hit the mark). After fouling it looked bleak: they would need to go the length of the floor and score for \"Yes\" to win. Down 4, ShawnDre' Jones got it above the half court line, spotted up for an off balance 3......and missed as time expired. But wait! The ref called a foul in the act of the shot - a miracle for the yes pickers and an unbelievably bad foul for Miami. Had the 3PA gone in he could've tied the game with a single FT. He missed the first of 3 FTs but drained the 2nd. Miracle green!\n\n#4 - Comeback at the All England Club\n\nDate: July 11th, 2015\n\nProp: Wimbledon - Ladies Final (#1 Serena Williams v. #20 Garbine Muguruza): How many GAMES will Serena LOSE?\n\nOptions:\n\n7 Games or Fewer\n\n8 Games or More\n\nHow it all went down: I couldn't find odds specifically for the total Muguruza games won but Serena 2-0 was -200 so to win 12 games was right around even money, and the total games over 19.5 was -195. Considering both of those factors, 8 was favored. Muguruza came out strong and broke Serena in the 1st Set but ended up losing it 6-4, still on pace for the Streak win. In the 2nd set everything fell apart...Muguruza was broken twice to go down 5-1 with Serena serving for the title. All hope seemed lost for the over pickers. Even when Muguruza got a break to love win to go down 5-2 it didn't seem like it would make too much of a difference, and quite frankly I didn't want to get my hopes up that we'd have an all-time finish. She then held serve and played a game for the ages, winning after 3 deuce points (while saving a match point along the way) to go down 5-4. The prop was over! Muguruza was broken the next game and Serena won the title, leaving the \"Serena Games Lost\" number at exactly 8. It's props like this that make Streak great...even though the match outcome was never in question, anyone who had a pick was locked into the match as the drama was unfolding in the 2nd Set.\n\n#3 - The Victorian Era\n\nDate: December 15th, 2015\n\nProp: Bangladesh Premier League - Final (Dhaka, Bangladesh): Who will WIN the championship?\n\nOptions:\n\nBarisal Bulls\n\nComilla Victorians\n\nHow it all went down: Top Hats? Carriages on cobblestone streets? Not that Victorian Era, we're talking cricket here. The Barisal Bulls, picked by only 10%, put up 156 runs as the underdog batting first and looked to be in solid shape. The Victorians struggled out of the gate and got behind, finding themselves in a desperate situation down 23 runs with only 13 balls left. Now, I haven't watched a ton of cricket in my life (maybe 50 matches or so), but what happened next seemed to me like it was not only a glimpse at the magic the sport can offer, the drama rivaled almost anything I've seen in baseball. It seemed like every ball was either a wicket or a boundary 4 with the Comilla Victorians swinging for the fences. I didn't look it up myself, but the consensus on the Streak boards (take the validity with a grain of salt) was that the live line was in the neighborhood of the Bulls as a -3000 favorite. As the comeback ensued with each bowl the line kept dropping to the point where eventually Comilla climbed back to tie the match at 156 to 156 with one ball left. One ball left for the Bangladesh Premier League title! The final bowl was an ugly one but it got the job done - Alok Kapali took the low toss on the pads and flicked it on, scoring exactly 1 run to seal the championship and the 157 to 156 win for almost 50,000 streakers.\n\n#2 - No Rest at Sleep Train Arena\n\nDate: November 6th, 2015\n\nProp: NBA: Which side will record a HIGHER TOTAL?\n\nOptions:\n\nRockets: Winning Margin\n\n@ Kings: 3-Pointers Made or Tie\n\nHow it all went down: To set the scene, the spread was Rockets -4.5 making the Kings' 3's a decent favorite on the prop. With Streak nation being as savvy as they are almost 70% picked them (including the entire monthly leaderboard) but from the start it looked like one of those props where the \"right\" side was destined to go down in flames - jet fuel rocket flames to be precise. Houston got out to a big lead early in the 2nd Half, but what's the cardinal rule of the NBA again? EVERYONE. MAKES. A RUN. I remember thinking exactly this, and speak of the devil with 10 minutes left in the 4th Quarter the Kings had cut the lead to 2 and managed to keep it relatively close until crunch time. With the Kings at 8 3-pointers made the Rockets stretched the lead out to 9 and began to dribble the ball uncontested, at which point even I thought it was over. But there was a ray of hope: the shot clock was exactly a second ahead of the game clock. The Rockets turned the ball over on a shot clock violation and as they were literally walking off the court in victory Seth Curry pushed it ahead to Darren Collison who pulled up from 32 feet...and to quote Marv Albert \"canned the triple\"! Kings win the prop 9-6 when it didn't seem possible and set a new standard for the term \"garbage time\".\n\n#1 - Cougars are a Different Breed\n\nDate: January 2nd, 2015\n\nProp: Armed Forces Bowl (Fort Worth, TX): Who will WIN this matchup?\n\nOptions:\n\nHouston Cougars (7-5)\n\nPittsburgh Panthers (6-6)\n\nHow it all went down: Let's jump ahead in the action: Pitt led this one 31-6 with 13:58 to go in the 4th Quarter. Houston marched down the field, scored a TD and then watched Pitt answer with a FG to make it 34-13 with 6:14 left. Once again, Houston showed some resilience as QB Greg Ward Jr. threw his first TD of the game with only 3:41 left. This is when it all went off the rails for the Panthers. Lining up for the onside kick Houston got a perfect bounce and recovered. Just like that, they were in business but still with a lot of work left to do. With 1:58 on the clock and facing 4th and 13 from the Pitt 29, Greg Ward Jr. struck again finding Demarcus Ayers on a 29 yard strike to make it 34-27. It was a nice comeback, don't get me wrong, but up to this point it still looked a bit meaningless. They would need a second onside kick recovery to even have a shot. So Houston lined up, kicked the ball and to everyone's amazement it somehow squirted out of a Pitt player's hands...Houston recovered! With just under a minute left on 3rd and 16 from the Pitt 25 Houston found the end zone again! Guess who? Greg. Ward. Jr. He connected on his 3rd TD pass in under 3 minutes of game action to go down 1. So it was going to be tied, head to OT and have it all decided there, right? Wrong! Houston, with all the momentum in their corner, went for 2 and got it. They now led 35-34 with only 59 seconds left. Pitt had one last chance, and they got it when QB Chad Voytik lofted a perfect pass to Tyler Boyd. But Boyd, one of the best receivers in the nation, dropped it. Pitt would've been in FG range, but instead it ended in heartbreak for the Panthers.", "Sunday Notes: 2016 Masters Qualifiers": "Photo by: Hunter Martin/Augusta National Jordan Spieth and Justin Rose on No. 18 after Spieth won the 2015 Masters.\n\nThe following players qualified for the 2016 Masters Tournament, based on finishing in the top 12: Jordan Spieth, Phil Mickelson, Justin Rose, Rory McIlroy, Hideki Matsuyama, Paul Casey, Ian Poulter, Dustin Johnson, Hunter Mahan, Zach Johnson, Charley Hoffman, Rickie Fowler, Ryan Moore, Bill Haas, Kevin Streelman and Kevin Na.\n\nPar-4 11th Hardest Hole Again\n\nChris Trotman/Augusta National\n\nTiger Woods hits from the pine straw on No. 11 during the final round.\n\nThe most difficult hole for the second consecutive Masters was the 505-yard, par-4 11th hole.

The Suns, meanwhile, play the first five-game week of the season, thus the 10 rating for Phoenix. We also have to like Utah's prospects, as the Jazz earn the lone 9 rating of the week thanks to some particularly generous defensive matchups over the coming four games.\n\nInvestors in the Celtics, especially in the team's fringe assets, might want to seek better options for weekly competition with Boston playing just two games this coming week. The Grizzlies are also in the unfavorable two-game club and face two slow-paced teams with top rim protection in place.\n\nIt's about time\n\nESPN Stats & Info researched the leaders in positive minute margins over the past month in the NBA by position group. Playing time is the most elemental stat we seek in a player's profile, so identifying the assets earning increased exposure can help us target some widely available values in both daily and redraft competition.\n\nCenters Player Oct/Nov December Diff.

Their defense ranks third in field goal percentage when defending the roll man on pick-and-roll plays and rank first when defending the ball handler on pick-and-roll plays (35.8 percent).\n\nStephen Curry is averaging the most points per play (1.07) as the ball handler on pick-and-roll plays (minimum 100 possessions). Curry's adjusted shooting percentage as the ball handler on pick-and-rolls is 57.2 percent, also the best in the league. Apparently this guy is pretty good.\n\nHassan Whiteside is shooting 77.1 percent as the roll man on pick-and-roll plays this season and scores on 65.5 percent of those plays. Both are the best marks in the NBA this season, again per ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nPlayer pickups: Identifying values in both ESPN leagues\n\nFor this early small sample of the season, we discuss an undervalued asset available in at least half of ESPN leagues at each position.\n\nPoint guard: Ish Smith (owned in 27.6 percent of ESPN leagues) will surely surge in ownership this week as leagues catch on to his shift back to the 76ers in what could be a fertile fantasy situation if they give him the minutes his numbers merit this season. Smith is by far the team's best option now, with 11.9 points, 8.1 assists, 1.2 steals and 4.2 boards in 30.3 minutes in the first 17 games of the season. Smith lost his high-usage role with Tyreke Evans returning to the Pelicans, but now regains lost luster and could have enduring value going forward. ... The pickings get slimmer as the season matures, while we can often mine for the most meaningful minutes from undervalued veterans at point guard. Guys like Jameer Nelson (20.7) and Patrick Beverley (22.8) are currently earning strong offensive shares as the lead guards for teams that trend up-tempo.\n\nShooting guard: Darren Collison (49.7) is right on the ownership border, and is another asset deserving of more attention in ESPN leagues. Collison regularly tops 30 minutes as the only capable complementary scoring guard next to Rajon Rondo on the roster. The Kings' shooting guard depth chart remains unproductive, leaving combo guard Collison with a worthy share. ... Alec Burks (47.1) can run cold in Utah's equal-opportunity offensive scheme, but we also find nice scoring pop at a shallow position, as shooting guard is among the thinner markets in fantasy basketball this season. ...\n\nSmall forward: Memphis' Matt Barnes (42) is starting over Zach Randolph as the team seeks some instant modernization after years of the grit-and-grind model, going with a smaller stretch forward in Barnes. The increased exposure has Barnes ranked as the second-most-valuable asset among small forwards in steals and blocks over the past 15 days.\n\nPower forward: Blocks and steals are traditionally hard to source, making Clint Capela (32.6) interesting given he averaged at least one of each this season and even better numbers when starting. ... Jon Leuer (29.7) is going to see some weak box scores with the Suns' fickle rotation patterns, but he remains the most valuable forward on the roster given that Markieff Morris is still entrenched in a low-end role and was suspended two games.\n\nCenter: Bismack Biyombo's (39) run as a starter could come to an end soon with Jonas Valanciunas returning later this week, but we still find value for him as a depth commodity given he's third in rebounding value over the past 15 days at the position and should continue to earn over 20 minutes per game. ... Nikola Jokic (11.5) is the guy to target in the Denver frontcourt, as Joffrey Lauvergne (10.9) is ceding minutes and touches to Jokic of late. Jokic has a versatile floor game that includes double-double ability and a helpful assist rate of late.", "ESPN.com's division-by-division rankings index": "Check out my rankings within each division by clicking on the links below.\n\nWho is the best fighter regardless of weight class?

Tyson Fury (25-0)\n\nTyson Fury AP Photo/Martin Meissner\n\nEngland's Fury came into his mandatory shot against long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko on Klitschko's turf in Germany on Nov. 28. Owning a rare size advantage and a certain swagger about him, he pulled off a remarkable upset. Fury shut down the usually dominant Klitschko and ended his 9\u00bd-year championship run to win the world title, although both guys performed poorly in a terrible fight. It was just that Fury was less bad than Klitschko, who quickly decided to exercise his right to an immediate rematch. They will meet again as soon as April but probably no later than June. Because Fury is bound to a rematch, he was stripped of one of the alphabet belts for declining to fight mandatory challenger Vyacheslav Glazkov.\n\nNext: TBA vs. Klitschko\n\n2. Wladimir Klitschko (64-4)\n\nDuring his 9\u00bd-year title reign -- second-longest in heavyweight history -- Klitschko successfully defended the title 18 times, third-most in division history. He had an 11\u00bd-year undefeated run and won 22 fights in a row. But then he defended against England's Tyson Fury and showed virtually nothing, perhaps growing old before our eyes at age 39. He landed an abysmal 52 of 231 punches (23 percent) in their Nov. 28 fight in Germany and lost a clear decision in a terrible fight to a guy who didn't do all that much more than he did. But a loss is a loss and Klitschko's historic reign came to an ignominious end. He will look to start another one as he decided to go for the immediate rematch he had the contractual right to have.\n\nNext: TBA vs. Fury\n\n3. Alexander Povetkin (30-1)\n\nDropped four times in a shutout loss in a horrible performance challenging champion Klitschko in October 2013, Povetkin has rebounded with four good wins in a row, including a crushing first-round knockout -- 91 seconds -- of Mike Perez on May 22 in Moscow, Russia, to become the mandatory challenger for titleholder Deontay Wilder. Since the shot at Wilder won't come until 2016, Povetkin stayed busy on Nov. 4 by scoring a 12th-round stoppage of Poland's Mariusz Wach, whose only previous loss was by decision in a 2012 title fight against Klitschko.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n4. Deontay Wilder (35-0)\n\nWilder, the 2008 U.S. Olympic bronze medalist, fought a collection of has-beens and nobodies until facing a real opponent in Bermane Stiverne in January. Wilder passed that test and won a world title by one-sided decision, but since then it's been back to poor opposition for his first two defenses: the radically unqualified Eric Molina, who nonetheless put up a good fight and hurt Wilder in the fourth round before being stopped in the ninth, and the even more unknown Frenchman Johann Duhaupas, who showed great heart in taking a beating for 11 rounds of a one-sided fight on Sept. 26. Wilder is due to face mandatory challenger Povetkin (30-1), but since Povetkin is not available until later in 2016, Wilder will return to headline a Showtime card against Polish contender Artur Szpilka (20-1).\n\nNext: Jan. 16 vs. Szpilka\n\n5. Ruslan Chagaev (34-2-1)\n\nAfter Uzbekistan native Chagaev blew away Francesco Pianeta in the first round to retain his secondary title in July, he was due to give Fres Oquendo a court-ordered rematch on Oct. 17 in Germany. However, Oquendo suffered a serious shoulder injury in training and the fight was canceled. With Oquendo out indefinitely, Chagaev will move on to a fight with Australian mandatory challenger Lucas \"Big Daddy\" Browne (23-0).\n\nNext: March 5 vs. Browne\n\n6. Luis Ortiz (24-0)\n\nA 6-foot-4, 240-pound southpaw with raw power, Ortiz, a Cuban defector with tons of amateur experience, claimed vacant interim belt in October by blasting out Matias Ariel Vidondo. That win did not prove much but Ortiz made a massive statement in his next fight that he is a force to be reckoned with when he put on an extremely impressive display en route to a crowd-pleasing seventh-round knockout of former title challenger Bryant Jennings on Dec. 19 in an HBO-televised main event.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n7. Bermane Stiverne (25-2-1)\n\nStiverne's first title defense on Jan. 17 against mandatory challenger Wilder could not have gone worse, as he lost a wide unanimous decision and his title then spent two nights in a Las Vegas hospital being treated for severe dehydration. He passed on a return bout for an interim title against Cuban puncher Luis Ortiz on Oct. 17 on the Gennady Golovkin-David Lemieux HBO PPV undercard and instead returned Nov. 14 in an untelevised bout in which he got knocked down in the first round but won a tight decision against journeyman Derric Rossy.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n8. Kubrat Pulev (22-1)\n\nBulgaria's Pulev, a 2008 Olympian, got his mandatory title shot against Klitschko on Nov. 15, 2014, and got hammered. Pulev landed a couple of solid right hands, but Klitschko abused the challenger with left hooks, dropping him four times with that weapon in a brutal fifth-round knockout. Pulev made his ring return on Oct. 17 and pounded out an eight-round shutout victory against 41-year-old Argentine journeyman George Arias. On Dec.5, Pulev fought again and blew out journeyman Maurice Harris in the first round.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n9. Bryant Jennings (19-2)\n\nAlthough Philadelphia's Jennings lost a lopsided decision to then-champion Wladimir Klitschko on April 25, he had a couple of good moments in the bout and exceeded expectations by lasting the distance against an all-time great champion. Jennings returned on Dec. 19 to challenge Cuban southpaw Luis Ortiz for his interim title in an HBO main event. It was a terrific action fight but Jennings could not handle Ortiz's power. He repeatedly hurt Jennings until finally knocking him down and stopping him in the seventh round.\n\nNext: TBA\n\n10. Vyacheslav \"Czar\" Glazkov (21-0-1)\n\nGlazkov, a 2008 Olympic bronze medalist from Ukraine, did very little in a March 14 title eliminator against former two-time cruiserweight titlist Steve Cunningham, yet came away with an undeserved decision win in a terrible fight to become one of champion Klitschko's mandatory challengers. With Klitschko losing to Tyson Fury and then locking in the contractual rematch, Fury was stripped of one of his belts because he declined to make the mandatory against Glazkov, who will instead face Charles Martin (22-0-1) for the vacant belt.\n\nNext: Jan.16 vs. Martin", "Robbie Lawler outlasts Rory MacDonald": "The best moment of the UFC welterweight championship fight between Robbie Lawler and Rory MacDonald on July 11 came at the end of the fourth round.\n\nBoth were hurt, bloodied, disfigured. As the round ended, Lawler turned his face to the ground and spewed blood at the canvas. When he looked up, Lawler and MacDonald caught each other's gaze for a good five seconds.\n\nEditor's Picks Gallery: The best shots from UFC 189 Photographer Rod Mar was cageside to take in all the action Saturday at UFC 189 from Las Vegas.\n\nLawler scowled. MacDonald stared calmly back at him. It was like they were both searching for any sign the other was breaking and coming up empty. And the stakes couldn't have been higher. MacDonald has been labeled \"the future\" of the sport since he was 16. Georges St-Pierre's protege. Lawler finally realized his full potential in 2014 after 13 years in the sport, not ready to cede the throne so quickly.\n\nThis fight, which Lawler won by TKO in the fifth round, ranks up there with the greatest fights in UFC history. Lawler broke MacDonald's nose with punches at some point. By the middle of the third, MacDonald's face was virtually unrecognizable. UFC commentator Joe Rogan described it as a \"mask of blood.\"\n\nIt was the third round in which MacDonald turned the fight in his favor, though. He wobbled Lawler with a right head kick in the final minute. Lawler was on shaky legs as he went to his corner in between rounds. When he came out in the fourth, MacDonald hit him with kicks again. Referee John McCarthy could be heard asking Lawler if he was OK. Lawler's response was indignant. Of course he was OK.\n\nWhen Lawler came out in the fifth, he was actually behind 39-37 on all three judges' scorecards. He needed a finish to defeat MacDonald, and he got it one minute in, when he caught MacDonald with his signature left hand. After MacDonald crumpled to the canvas, he tried to sit up but fell back again. Video of the jarring moment was widely circulated on social media.\n\nThree months after the fight, in an interview with ESPN.com inside the MGM Grand, where the fight took place, Lawler said, \"I hope I never have to go through another fight like that. That was a war. It was a great performance by both fighters, but I don't want to have to do that again. No one wants to fight like that if they don't have to. ... That's just heart and determination. You rely on it if you have to.\"\n\nHonorable mentions:\n\n2. Daniel Cormier vs. Alexander Gustafsson, UFC 192 on Oct. 3\n\nDaniel Cormier, right, successfully defended his light heavyweight title, defeating Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 192. Ross Dettman for ESPN\n\nFor the second time in two years, Gustafsson pushed a light heavyweight champion to the brink of defeat, only to see that champion rise to the occasion in the final round. Gustafsson has to be sick of this narrative, but he shouldn't be ashamed of it. His fight against Jon Jones at UFC 165 was the 2013 fight of the year, and his decision loss to Cormier in October was nearly as good. Cormier and Gustafsson have contrasting styles, but they are such great fighters, and they surprised each other at times during this fight with their strengths. You had Gustafsson taking Cormier down on several occasions and Cormier outstriking the lanky kickboxer in others. As was the case in 2013, this fight revealed the size of each light heavyweight's heart. Judges were split after five rounds, with Cormier getting the nod.\n\n3. Edson Barboza vs. Paul Felder, UFC on Fox on July 25\n\nEdson Barboza, left, used his dynamic striking ability to outpoint Paul Felder on July 25. Ross Dettman for ESPN\n\nThis UFC Chicago event will be remembered mostly for TJ Dillashaw's second win against Renan Barao and Miesha Tate earning a title shot she never received. But the best 15 minutes of the night came in a lightweight fight between Barboza and Felder, two lightning quick fighters. This was a violent, technical chess match on the feet, and it took place at warp speed, with Barboza winning by unanimous decision. Wouldn't mind seeing this one again someday.\n\n4. Benson Henderson vs. Brandon Thatch, UFC Fight Night on Feb. 14\n\nBenson Henderson, left, scored one of the greatest wins of his career against Brandon Thatch. Ed Mulholland for ESPN\n\nGoing in, there was a very real feeling that Henderson was biting off more than he could chew. Coming off a split-decision loss in January he felt he won, Henderson agreed to move up in weight to fight one of the bigger men of the welterweight division on two weeks' notice. There is no question size matters in MMA, but Henderson reminded us that technique can trump all. This was one of the greatest wins of his career.\n\n5. Justin Gaethje vs. Luis Palomino I, WSOF 19 on March 28\n\nJustin Gaethje, right, and Luis Palomino fought twice in 2015, but their first meeting at WSOF in March was one of the best of the year. Dave Mandel/Sherdog.com\n\nEvery Gaethje fight is wild, but he and Palomino took it to another level twice in 2015. Their rematch in September was good, but the original was better. Palomino went down multiple times. At the end of the first round, Gaethje recklessly front-flipped into Palomino's chest, apparently for the sheer heck of it. It was a test of endurance and pain tolerance.

college football recruiters wanted him": "Oklahoma QB Baker Mayfield shares his thoughts on speaking his mind rather than staying quiet and how he feels being favored going into their bowl game against Clemson. (1:12)\n\nIf Baker Mayfield sounds angry, it's probably because he is.\n\nSure, he's plenty cool under pressure and doesn't easily rattle. But go back and watch some of his games this season at Oklahoma. He plays like somebody just showered him with the nastiest of insults. He plays angry, and it has been that way ever since he put up big numbers at Lake Travis High School in Austin, Texas, only to be labeled as an undersized system quarterback unworthy of a big-time scholarship.\n\nAll that really matters now: He's a big-time quarterback who has the Sooners on the biggest of stages, and what drives Mayfield is the same thing that drove him back in high school when just about everybody was telling him he wasn't good enough (or big enough) to play at this level.\n\nEditor's Picks Capital One Orange Bowl: No. 4 Oklahoma vs. No. 1 Clemson Check out ESPN's coverage of the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Capital One Orange Bowl, which will be aired live on ESPN on Dec. 31.\n\nTop 25 players in the CFP: Watson is No. 1 The CFP bracket is littered with the very best talent. But who are the 25 best players, in order? Start with Clemson QB Deshaun Watson, and then things get very interesting.\n\nPFF: 21 predictions for final 21 games of bowl season Want to look smart at your New Year's party? Then pretend these Pro Football Focus predictions are your own, and let everybody know how the last 21 games of the season will play out. 2 Related\n\n\"That's made me who I am today, all the stuff I had to overcome, just going out and grinding it out and working for it,\" Mayfield told ESPN.com. \"That's who I am. That's who I've always been. It's made me better, not only as a football player, but as a person.\"\n\nOklahoma coach Bob Stoops said Mayfield has been the missing piece for the Sooners, who rebounded from five losses a year ago and an upset loss to Texas earlier this season to play their way into a College Football Playoff semifinal matchup with Clemson on Thursday.\n\nNobody saw this coming from the Sooners back on Oct. 10, when they wilted in the Dallas heat against the Longhorns, and nobody saw Mayfield coming, either. He walked on at Texas Tech as a true freshman in 2013 and led the Red Raiders to wins in each of his first five starts before injuring his leg. Unsure about his future at Texas Tech as to whether he would be placed on scholarship, Mayfield decided to leave and take his shot as a walk-on again -- this time at Oklahoma.\n\n\"For him to just show up without ever calling anybody here tells you what kind of belief he has in himself,\" Stoops said. \"He's a special story. He wasn't going to let anybody decide his football future for him. He was going to be the one to decide it.\"\n\nMayfield, who's listed at 6-foot-1, wasn't quite 5-foot-11 as a junior in high school. He was ranked by ESPN as the No. 69 pocket passer in the country and became so disillusioned with the recruiting process that he decided at one point he'd just go to Florida Atlantic.\n\n\"They told me they wanted me, that they had a scholarship for me and it was on the beach,\" Mayfield recalled. \"What 18-year-old doesn't want to go to school on the beach? My dad sat me down and said: 'You're better than that. That's not where you want to go. You're just settling.' \"\n\nThere have been bumps in the road and slights on the recruiting trail. But without those, Oklahoma's Baker Mayfield may not have gotten to where he is now -- heading into the CFP as one of the nation's hottest players. AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez\n\nMayfield knew his dad was right. But to this day, he seethes over the way quarterbacks are evaluated and how blind the process can be to what's really important about the position.\n\n\"One of the problems is that a lot of the people evaluating quarterbacks now, I'll guarantee you they never played quarterback,\" Mayfield said. \"They don't know what to look for. Anybody can find a kid who's 6-foot-4 and has a big arm and looks like he's ready to play, but that doesn't mean he has any of the mental aspects that it takes to play the position at this level.\n\n\"You look at the NFL now, and you go from 6-foot-6 all the way down to 5-foot-11 with Russell Wilson and Drew Brees. You don't necessarily have to have that size. If a guy can throw and is accurate and carries himself and his team, that's the biggest part of being a quarterback. It's about being a leader and how you get your players to play with you and how hard they can go and how they respond to you.\"\n\nMayfield went to only two camps following his junior season of high school, Elite 11 and Nike qualifying camps, both in Dallas. He remembers Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo showing up at one of them, and the other thing he remembers is a lot of hype following a lot of guys who weren't nearly as good as he was.\n\n\"I went on back-to-back days, a Friday and Saturday, and saw all those guys who had offers from everywhere in the country and all the ESPN cameras right there where they were stationed,\" Mayfield said. \"I'm thinking, 'I can throw better than them,' and we're right next to each other throwing and I'm not getting any recognition. So, yeah, there's been a chip on my shoulder that I formed, and it's gotten bigger ever since then.\n\n\"You can't define a quarterback by measuring him and watching him throw when nobody is trying to take his head off. There's a lot more to it than that, and a lot of the people doing the evaluating don't seem to get that.\"\n\nMayfield, who sat out last season because of NCAA transfer rules, finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting this season and wasn't invited to the ceremony in New York City. His Oklahoma teammates will tell you that he'll feed off that just like he has every other slight in his life.\n\n\"We love it when people doubt him because we know that means he's going to go out there and play that much better, that much tougher,\" Oklahoma center Ty Darlington said. \"The thing with Baker is that he lives for those moments, and you see what he's meant to our team.\"\n\nMayfield has accounted for 42 touchdowns (35 passing, seven rushing). Even more amazing, he has turned the ball over only five times, all interceptions. He hasn't lost a fumble, which is even more impressive when you consider how much he has scrambled and extended plays this season.\n\n\"He only knows one way to play, and there's no holding him back,\" Oklahoma offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley said. \"The guys on the team picked up on that trait pretty early this spring. You want to play for a guy like that.\"\n\nAnd Mayfield always wanted to play for Oklahoma. His family would make road trips to Norman to see the Sooners play when he was a kid. His father knew somebody on the staff at the time, but it wasn't enough of a connection for Oklahoma to show any serious interest in Mayfield out of high school.\n\n\"I don't hold that against them. Nobody wanted me,\" said Mayfield, offering a chuckle. \"It all worked out in the end, and the fact that I had to earn everything just to get here makes it even more worthwhile.\"\n\nMayfield also has a message for quarterbacks going through the recruiting process now, not to mention those already in college who might be looking to transfer.\n\n\"It's going to be tough, no matter what, and there's going to be competition, no matter what,\" said Mayfield, who transferred to Oklahoma despite the Sooners having five scholarship quarterbacks on their roster at the time. \"I didn't transfer based on competition. I transferred based on lack of a relationship (with Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury).\n\n\"So many guys transfer nowadays because they think there's too much competition at a place. I think they're overdoing it, but you're going to have to grind it out no matter where you are. When people are picking where they want to go to school, you have to feel out what's going to be the best opportunity for you and your future. That's why I came to Oklahoma. Kids need to look at that instead of who's blowing up their phones the most and who's making them the most promises and telling them what they want to hear.\"\n\nMayfield doesn't need to hear from anybody that he's legit. He has proved it and then some, and he plans on doing so for two more games this season.", "Notes: Donaire's 1st defense could be against Gradovich": "A few notes from around the boxing world:\n\nNewly crowned junior featherweight titleholder Nonito Donaire (36-3, 23 KOs), who reclaimed his old belt with a unanimous decision against Cesar Juarez (17-4, 13 KOs) on Friday night in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is looking to return in April, manager Cameron Dunkin told ESPN.com. Dunkin said there is no set date, but a possible opponent is fellow former featherweight titlist Evgeny Gradovich, who would drop down in weight, as Donaire did earlier this year. Gradovich (20-1-1, 9 KOs), who is from Russia but based in Oxnard, California, where he trains with Robert Garcia -- Donaire\u2019s former trainer -- lost his belt by eighth-round technical decision to Lee Selby in Wales in May but rebounded for an eight-round decision win against journeyman Aldimar Silva Santos on Oct. 24.

Whether the fight will happen is another story because Eubank (21-1, 16 KOs) won an elimination bout by seventh-round knockout of Gary \u201cSpike\u201d O\u2019Sullivan on Saturday to become the mandatory challenger for world titleholder Daniel Jacobs. Hennessy seemed to think the fight would happen. \u201cChris Eubank Jr. might be hoping to fight for a world title, but that's not going to happen any time soon,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was imminent, or even a possibility, why would his promoter submit such a large bid for a British title fight? I know Chris Eubank Jr. has wanted to win the British title for a long time, so it came as no surprise to me when I heard his promoter had submitted a large bid. I'm just delighted we were able to better that offer. We now look forward to promoting a British title blockbuster between two world-class fighters next year.\u201d", "NFL, CBS and ESPN Deportes team up for Spanish-language Super Bowl broadcast": "The NFL, CBS Sports and ESPN have reached a new television broadcast agreement calling for ESPN Deportes to televise the Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl 50.\n\nThe agreement, announced Monday, will bring the NFL's showpiece event, scheduled for Feb. 7, 2016, in Santa Clara, California, to ESPN Deportes for the first time.\n\n\"As the broadcaster of Super Bowl 50, it was a priority for us to find a Spanish-language partner to televise this historic broadcast and reach the NFL's Hispanic fan base,\" Sean McManus, chairman of CBS Sports, said in a statement issued by ESPN. \"The ESPN Deportes presentation of Super Bowl 50 will be a great complement to our broadcast on CBS.\"\n\nESPN Deportes' Monday Night Football play-by-play voice, Alvaro Martin, will be joined in the booth for the game by analyst and former NFL kicker Raul Allegre, with John Sutcliffe working as the sideline reporter.\n\n\"Super Bowl 50 is one of the most anticipated events of the year, and this agreement with CBS and the NFL presents a unique opportunity for ESPN to further connect with the growing U.S. Hispanic NFL fan base,\" ESPN Deportes vice president Freddy Rolon said. \"The Super Bowl's golden anniversary is a great addition to our diverse portfolio of events for 2016.\"\n\nThe news release said ESPN Deportes will kick off its extensive Super Bowl week preview coverage Feb. 1, and coverage will include a live, 90-minute pregame special and an extensive postgame show.\n\nBrian Rolapp, the NFL's executive vice president of media, said, \"We are excited to partner with CBS and ESPN Deportes to broadcast Super Bowl 50 domestically in English and Spanish.\"\n\n\"We are committed to delivering our games in customized ways to serve our growing Hispanic fan base and look forward to connecting with our fans on Super Bowl Sunday on CBS and ESPN Deportes,\" he added.\n\nIn a separate announcement Monday, ESPN said ESPN Deportes also will present the Spanish-language simulcast of the upcoming national semifinals and championship game of the second College Football Playoff.", "AJ McCarron of Cincinnati Bengals set for MRI on wrist": "After trailing 14-0, the Broncos rally to force overtime, sealing the victory by recovering AJ McCarron's fumble and defeating the Bengals 20-17 to clinch a playoff berth.

That option may now be off the table entirely after the Mets reportedly agreed to a deal with Alejandro De Aza.\n\nCespedes literally powered the Mets to their first postseason appearance since 2006, belting 17 homers with a .942 OPS in 57 games after coming over in a July 31 trade with the Tigers. Cespedes, however, has his eyes on a deal north of $100 million, which is too much for the Mets\u2019 more modest tastes.\n\nThe Mets may have completed their holiday shopping with the one-year deal for De Aza, who will serve as a lefty-hitting complement to Juan Lagares in center field.\n\nThere was some speculation that the Mets might have some additional funds available for Cespedes after Michael Cuddyer surprisingly announced his retirement, freeing up about $12.1 million for 2016. That changed with the roughly $4.5 million deal for De Aza, which seems to \u201cslam the door\u201d on the possibility of re-signing Cespedes, reports Anthony McCarron and Kristie Ackert of the New York Daily News.\n\nMike Puma of the New York Post adds the Mets have not been pursuing Cespedes in recent weeks.\n\nSo where does that leave Cespedes?\n\nKen Rosenthal of FoxSports.com suggests Cespedes might consider a one-year deal before re-entering the free-agent sweepstakes next winter, when the pickings are expected to be slim. Teams are reluctant to sacrifice a draft pick on a free agent signing a shorter deal, but that is not an issue with Cespedes because he was traded during the season.\n\nAs for possible suitors, AJ Cassavell of MLB.com recently suggested the best fit is in Baltimore given the Orioles\u2019 offer to Chris Davis reportedly is off the table. The power numbers for Cespedes could spike in the cozy dimensions at Camden Yards.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants could use a power bat in left field, but they already have committed big bucks to Jeff Samardzija and Johnny Cueto. If Cespedes considers a short-term deal, maybe San Francisco is a viable option.\n\nOur rumors roundup continues with more players and teams doing some holiday shopping:", "Ace-maker Ivo Karlovic can still hang with the top dogs": "It is again time to hand out our year-end awards. Today, we look at the top men's unsung heroes of the year, but click here to check out the rest of our list.\n\nTop men's unsung heroes\n\nIt's the \"best of\" season in tennis, when everyone gets to choose their top performers, top shots, top moments, top everythings. It's an enjoyable exercise and a nice journey through the just-completed year, but by definition it leaves out a lot.\n\nAfter all, there are two forms of success -- the quantifiable kind, easily measured in title counts and rankings. Then there's the relative kind: how someone fared relative to their skills, personal history and expectations.\n\nSo let's acknowledge three players who didn't have anywhere near the kind of year that would land them on a \"best of\" or \"most this or that\" list. In fact, only one of them hit his career-high ranking this year. But all three have abundant reasons to feel proud of their performances in 2015.\n\nLeon Neal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDoes any shot in tennis command more respect and resonate with a greater sense of authority and finality than the service ace? This year, Karlovic surpassed Goran Ivanisevic to become tennis's all-time ace-maker, popping out the unreturnables like a 6-foot-11 Pez dispenser.\n\nKarlovic hit the record-setting 10,238th ace of his career at the China Open this fall. He banged it out during a 26-ace performance against Pablo Cuevas. Perhaps fittingly, Karlovic lost the match in two excruciating tie breakers. The tennis gods have a sense of humor, after all.\n\nYou know how Karlovic is: On a day when he's merely serving well, he beats most guys outside the top 30. On a day when he's serving and volleying well he can beat most guys outside the top 10. On a day when he's serving and volleying well and getting a few returns back into play he can beat anyone -- including Novak Djokovic.\n\nIn fact, Karlovic was the only player outside the year-end top five to beat Djokovic in 2015. It was no fluke, either. Karlovic is 3-1 against Djokovic, sweeping their hard-court meetings while losing their sole encounter on clay.\n\nRapidly closing on age 37, Karlovic is the oldest player in the ATP top 200. Currently No. 23, he's just nine ticks off his career-high ranking of No. 14, which he hit more than seven years ago. Karlovic has proved astonishingly durable. And he won a title this year (Delray Beach), which puts him one up on the likes of a number of more well-known players, including Grigor Dimitrov, Gael Monfils -- and the two other subjects of this column.\n\n\"It's a great feeling,\" Karlovic told the press after he set the new ace mark. \"My serve is my biggest weapon and I always take pride in it. To be able to do this is a great feeling and a great accomplishment.\"\n\nBy the end of the year Karlovic had 10,442 aces and counting. Cha-ching!\n\nGeoff Burke/USA TODAY Sports\n\nAt the start of the year, Fognini was an interesting question mark. A stylish, mercurial Italian more given to clowning around than plowing opponents under, he was coming off a splendid 2014 during which he won the third singles title of his career and hit a career high of No. 13.\n\nSo what? In tennis, almost every decent pro goes on a run at least once in his career. The question lurking was, did Fognini, who would turn 28 in mid-2015, somehow turn a corner and become a mature competitor capable of harnessing all that flair and talent?\n\nRafael Nadal provided the answer -- much to his own detriment. The luck of the draw threw the men together five times in 2015 -- an astonishing frequency when you consider the odds -- with Fognini winning three of the encounters. The most significant of those was their third-round clash at the US Open.\n\nNadal lost that match in five sets, his first loss in 152 five-setters after being up two sets. It was an eye-opening, character-affirming performance that did wonders for Fognini's street cred. And the way he stood inside the court and hit a blazing stream of nearly flat, angled winners provided a template for anyone who would challenge a baseline muscleman. To many (including ESPN.com) that struggle was the ATP match of the year.\n\nFognini is temperamental; he'll likely never travel on a smooth rankings or results trajectory. He's also 5-foot-10 and no powerhouse, so he's obliged to survive by his wits. But his matches against Nadal demonstrated that he's potentially much more than a quirky, entertaining journeyman. There's a seat waiting for him at the table where the elite pros play, if he's got the desire and determination to join their game.\n\nChinaFotoPress/Getty Images\n\nFognini, the man who knocked Nadal out of the US Open, was immediately beaten by Lopez in the next round. Like Karlovic, Lopez is defying the ravages of age.\n\nIt took Lopez, a lefty serve-and-volleyer, years to get where he is today, a good number of them more-or-less wasted. For long stretches he seemed content to live the comfortable, low-stress life of an in-demand, good-looking top 25 pro. Perhaps it's no coincidence that he's playing his most fearsome tennis now that he's settled down (Lopez married in July), although the quantum leap in his game traces to 2014. His results that year set the stage for Lopez to reach his career-high ranking of No. 12 early this year.\n\nLopez's success is largely due to his full embrace of the attacking style to which his game, with its lefty ju-ju and heavy underspin, is so well suited. Lopez also developed the mental and technical discipline required to play a game designed to get him to the net to end points with the volley. He's one of those players for whom it all came together late (in his case, very late), but he's certainly making the most of it.\n\nLopez had quality wins this year against Nadal (Cincinnati Masters), Milos Raonic (Cincinnati and US Open), Nick Kyrgios (twice), Kei Nishikori (Indian Wells) and Fernando Verdasco. Not bad for a guy playing an attacking style that some people say can't work anymore.", "Meadowlark Lemon was of his time but also ahead of his time": "ESPN's Ian Fitzsimmons and Mike Golic share their memories of Globetrotters legend Meadowlark Lemon, who passed away at the age of 83. (0:46)\n\nMeadowlark Lemon, the virtuoso shot maker and court jester known as the \"Clown Prince of Basketball\" during his barnstorming 24-year run with the Harlem Globetrotters, was a man who deserves to be remembered for being ahead of his time as much as a product of his time.\n\nThat isn't necessarily the consensus view of the man or his team, but understanding the complete context is vitally important when evaluating the life and impact of Lemon, who died Sunday in Scottsdale, Arizona, at the age of 83.\n\nEditor's Picks Globetrotters legend Meadowlark Lemon, 83, dies Hall of Famer Meadowlark Lemon, who thrilled audiences for 22 years as a member of the Harlem Globetrotters and continued to play well into his 70s, died Sunday. He was 83.\n\nLemon grew up in the Jim Crow South. Segregation was still the norm in the U.S., and professional sports options for black athletes -- like opportunities for blacks in general -- were limited, even non-existent.\n\nBy the end of his antic-filled run after he took over for Goose Tatum as the Globetrotters' chief showman, Lemon was best known for stunts such as the half-court hook shots he regularly sank and tossing a bucket full of what turned out to be confetti. He'd sneak a ball attached to a large rubber band into games and throw a pass that would unexpectedly come snapping back to him, causing startled crowds to laugh in delight. He kept up an animated dialogue with other players, his own teammates and spectators during games, and it didn't seem to matter what corner of the world the Globetrotters were visiting. Crowds, especially kids, were charmed.\n\nLemon's charisma and basketball chops rarely were lost in translation.\n\n\"My destiny,\" he once said, \"was to make people happy.\"\n\nOf course, Lemon knew even by the time he ended his 10,000-plus games with the Globetrotters in 1978 that some folks derided the team and his on-court comedy bits as dated at best and a traveling minstrel show at worst.\n\nThere were always plenty of smiles when Meadowlark Lemon played basketball. He once said his destiny \"was to make people happy.\" Dick Lewis/Getty Images\n\nBut civil rights activist Jesse Jackson is among those who took a contrary view. Jackson once said the Globetrotters were a \"positive\" influence, and Jackson didn't distinguish between all those years the Globetrotters were beating the mostly white Washington Generals in exhibition games or taking on college and pro teams in legitimate competitions as early as the 1920s. Jackson's reasoning?\n\n\"[The Globetrotters] did not show blacks as stupid,\" he explained. \"On the contrary, they were shown as superior.\"\n\nLemon seemed to reconcile the criticism he caught over the years in much the same way.\n\nFive years ago, Lemon compared what he did to the clown in a travelling ice show who thrashes and dashes all over the ice, throwing off the impression that he wasn't very good at what he did when the truth was, said Lemon, it was all for laughs and the stunt man \"was probably the best skater in the bunch.\"\n\nMuch like champion figure skaters and Olympic-level gymnasts, Lemon understood the magic of being a Globetrotter comes partly from making the extremely difficult look easy.\n\nHe never chose to try out for the NBA but never conceded that he wouldn't have made it, either. He simply loved what he did with the Globetrotters.\n\nHe was an unabashed entertainer long before that became the accepted norm in sports, and he was an accomplished athlete who helped break down racial barriers years before the civil rights era in the U.S. or black power protests leaked into events like the Mexico City Olympics in 1968.\n\n\"He changed people's attitudes about race, he changed foreigners' attitudes about America, and along the way, he made millions love the game of basketball,\" said Mannie Jackson, a teammate of Lemon's and former CEO of the Globetrotters.\n\nLemon and the Globetrotters prepare for their appearance on Goldie Hawn's 1978 TV special. AP Photo/Jeff Robbins\n\nVarious aspects of Lemon's background remain in dispute. Like many showmen, he never liked to advertise his age. There also remains some confusion as to whether he was born in North Carolina or South Carolina. But there is no confusion how he became smitten with his life's work.\n\nDuring his induction speech at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2003, Lemon said the Globetrotters caught his eye when he was just 11. He said he always went to the segregated movie theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina, on Saturday mornings for the all-day shows, and when he saw the Globetrotters on a newsreel working their magic, he was instantly enthralled.\n\n\"When they got to the court, they seemed to make that ball talk, and I said, 'That's mine. This is for me,'\" Lemon reminisced. \"I was receiving a vision. I was receiving a dream in my heart.\"\n\nLemon said he hurried out of the theater that day before the show was even over and ran home, made a hoop from a coat hanger and a net from an onion sack and then nailed it to a tree so he could teach himself how to play basketball. He added that his famous half-court hook shot had a creation story, too: He began perfecting it even before he owned a basketball by swinging around on a pole on the side of the street opposite his homemade hoop and throwing a Carnation condensed milk can through his makeshift rim.\n\nThe year Lemon discovered the Globetrotters as a boy was 1943.\n\nWhen the Globetrotters won two games against the Minneapolis Lakers, then one of the NBA's premier teams, in 1948 and '49, Lemon was still in high school. Besides legitimizing the Globetrotters as terrific players, not just showmen, the victories were often credited with the NBA's decision a year later to draft its first black player, Chuck Cooper, in 1950.\n\nLemon attended historically black Florida A&M college in 1952 but was drafted into the Army before he could finish. He cadged his first look from the Globetrotters in '54 while he was stationed in Austria and they were touring Europe. Once he began playing full time for the team after leaving the service and earning a tryout in 1955, he had an iron-man streak that would put Lou Gehrig and Cal Ripken to shame. Team records say Lemon appeared in 7,500 consecutive games in more than 100 countries. (Legend has it the only one he missed before starting another streak was supposedly because of a bad bowl of goulash in Hungary.)\n\nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame CEO John Doleva helps Lemon into his Hall of Fame jacket. Lemon was inducted in 2003. AP Photo/Michael Dwyer\n\nAt just 6-foot-3, Lemon wasn't the tallest Globetrotter ever. Though he had a good handle, he wasn't the team's most magical dribbler, either. Marcus Haynes and Curly Neal laid claim to that. Lemon wasn't even the Trotters' most famous player. The great Wilt Chamberlain played a year with them in 1958 after he left the University of Kansas but before he was eligible to sign with the NBA. Lemon, however, was arguably the Globetrotters' most charismatic player of all time. Once the NBA began siphoning off the best African-American players, the Globetrotters turned even more to stunts and trick shots with Lemon as the ringleader.\n\n\"I'm amazed at the love the world has for Meadowlark Lemon,\" said Mannie Jackson, who introduced Lemon at his Hall of Fame ceremony.\n\nWhen Lemon took the microphone, he reminisced about a year in which he and Jackson once used their annual vacation to hop in a car and travel around to pickup games where they kicked butt, took names and again left no doubt they were legit players.\n\n\"We showed people we could get down on them, and it felt good,\" Lemon said with a smile and a happy sigh. \"But little did we know everyone already knew we could play.\"\n\nThe only time Lemon -- who became an ordained minister late in life and ran a youth ministry until his death -- cried during his Hall of Fame speech was when he apologized to a long list of family members for being on the road so long he didn't spend enough time with them.\n\nAs news spread Monday of Lemon's passing, plenty of past and present NBA players paid their respects. The Clippers' Jamal Crawford shared a fond memory about always wanting to meet Lemon and how great it was to play a trick-shot game of PIG (the shorter version of HORSE) against him last year. Shaquille O'Neal praised Lemon's ability to connect with people. Isiah Thomas tweeted that he would miss Lemon as an adviser, conversationalist and friend. LeBron James told reporters after the Cavs' morning shootaround Monday that Lemon was among the old-school players he has watched.\n\nJames said, \"Any time a pioneer or someone who has given so much to the game is released from our brotherhood, our family, it's a sad day.\"\n\nYears ago, Lemon suggested a possible epitaph for himself when he looked back on his life. His operating philosophy: If he could just get folks he encountered to smile and laugh, he believed it would open a pathway to get them to consider other points he wanted to make, overtly or not.\n\nLemon himself never seemed to believe he was some minstrel that people were laughing at. He felt they were laughing right along with him. That was something that was always in style, no matter what era you happen to be from.", "Russian track and field federation suspended by sport's governing body": "ESPN Olympics reporter Bonnie Ford discusses what Russia will need to do to participate in track and field during the Rio games in 2016.

He set the tone early with a forced fumble that Quintin Demps returned for the Texans\u2019 first touchdown of the game. The Texans dominated every phase of the game, with the offense scoring 27 points and defense pitching a shutout until the second-half\u2019s two-minute warning. -- Tania Ganguli\n\nCHIEFS 17, BROWNS 13 | ANALYSIS\n\nJohnny Manziel. His running changed the tone of the Browns' loss to Kansas City. Manziel's first scramble came late in the first half, and his running carried the offense on a 21-play drive in the second half. He finished with 108 yards on 11 carries and joined Marcus Mariota and Cam Newton as the only quarterbacks to run for 100 yards this season. -- Pat McManamon\n\nChairman Clark Hunt. He supported the general manager and coach when the Chiefs started season so poorly. He was rewarded with a playoff spot Sunday. -- Adam Teicher\n\nCOLTS 18, DOLPHINS 12 | ANALYSIS\n\nRobert Mathis. The linebacker saved the Colts from being officially eliminated from the playoffs when he sacked Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill on fourth down at Indianapolis 14-yard line with 23 seconds remaining. The sack was the second of the game for Mathis and sixth of the game for the defense. -- Mike Wells\n\nJarvis Landry. The Dolphins receiver had seven receptions for 111 yards and he did it on a bad knee. Landry also became the first player in franchise history to record 100 receptions and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season. -- James Walker\n\nLIONS 32, 49ERS 17 | ANALYSIS\n\nDuJuan Harris. On the Baltimore Ravens practice squad on Monday, Harris, who has been with five teams this season and who was signed by the Niners on Tuesday, rushed for a career-high 73 yards on 11 carries. -- Paul Gutierrez\n\nMatthew Stafford. He has thrived under offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter. Stafford completed 29 of 37 passes for 301 yards and two touchdowns. It is his fourth consecutive multi-touchdown game and yet another one in which he appeared in complete control of the Lions\u2019 offense. -- Mike Rothstein\n\nBILLS 16, COWBOYS 6 | ANALYSIS\n\nSean Lee. He bristled when it was suggested he sit out the last two games of the season with nothing to play for, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve missed enough games.\u201d Snubbed from the Pro Bowl earlier in the week, Lee had 12 tackles, a half sack and two tackles for loss. -- Todd Archer\n\nSammy Watkins. It was a lackluster day for much of the Bills\u2019 offense without LeSean McCoy, Charles Clay and Robert Woods. But Watkins mostly did his part, leading the team with five catches for 84 yards. He was flagged three times, including twice for offensive pass interference, but the second such penalty probably prevented an interception. -- Mike Rodak\n\nBEARS 26, BUCCANEERS 21 | ANALYSIS\n\nHarold Jones-Quartey. Back in the starting lineup for the first time since October, Jones-Quartey sparked the Bears\u2019 defense with a forced fumble and interception. -- Jeff Dickerson\n\nCharles Sims. The reserve running back came in and had an effective day. Sims had a 50-yard touchdown reception and also ripped off a 29-yard fourth-quarter run. Sims was the most explosive player on offense for Tampa Bay, rushing for 45 yards on four carries and catching three passes for 72 yards. -- Rick Brown\n\nFALCONS 20, PANTHERS 13 | ANALYSIS\n\nGraham Gano. He was Carolina\u2019s best offensive weapon on a day the Panthers had little offense. He kicked two field goals, including a 47-yarder. -- David Newton\n\nJulio Jones. He gets it for his 70-yard touchdown reception alone. He dominated his battles against Josh Norman and got close to 200 receiving yards against one of the league\u2019s best defenses. He also surpassed his own team single-season record of 1,593 receiving yards. -- Vaughn McClure\n\nRAVENS 20, STEELERS 17 | ANALYSIS\n\nDeAngelo Williams. He was the lone bright spot for the Steelers, rushing for 100 yards on 17 carries along with two touchdowns. This is the first season since 2009 Williams has had multiple games of at least 100 yards and at least two touchdowns. -- Jeremy Fowler\n\nRyan Mallett. He didn't look like a quarterback who was starting his first game for the Ravens and who had been out of the league for two months. Mallett was accurate and decisive, completing 28 of 41 passes for 274 yards and one touchdown as double-digit underdog Baltimore upset AFC North rival Pittsburgh. He staked his claim to the Ravens' backup quarterback job in 2016. -- Jamison Hensley\n\nSAINTS 38, JAGUARS 19 | ANALYSIS\n\nAllen Robinson. He had his fifth 100-yard game of the season, catching six passes for 151 yards. One of those receptions was a 90-yard catch-and-run for a TD, the longest play from scrimmage in Jaguars history. It was a good way to show the rest of the NFL that he should have been in the Pro Bowl. -- Michael DiRocco\n\nDrew Brees. He had one of his most dominant performances of the season despite tearing the plantar fascia in his right heel six days earlier. He threw for 412 yards and three touchdowns, including touchdowns on the Saints\u2019 first two drives. -- Mike Triplett\n\nRAMS 23, SEAHAWKS 17 | ANALYSIS\n\nWilliam Hayes. The Rams' defensive dominance was too much to ignore and Hayes was at the center of it all. He finished with nine tackles, three sacks, four tackles for loss and five quarterback hits to lead the Rams to the upset. -- Nick Wagoner\n\nDoug Baldwin. They struggled to find a rhythm on offense for most of the game against the Rams, but Baldwin once again came up big with seven catches for 111 yards and a touchdown. Baldwin now has 14 touchdowns on the season, most in franchise history. He has scored 11 times in the past five games. -- Sheil Kapadia\n\nCARDINALS 38, PACKERS 8 | ANALYSIS\n\nMike Daniels. The defensive tackle made one of the only big plays for the Packers, intercepting a Carson Palmer screen pass in the second quarter and returning it to the Cardinals\u2019 15-yard line. Of course, the Packers couldn\u2019t turn that into any points. -- Rob Demovsky\n\nThe defense. The Arizona Cardinals defense had nine sacks, recovered three fumbles, intercepted one pass and scored two touchdowns in a rout of Green Bay. -- Josh Weinfuss\n\nVIKINGS 49, GIANTS 17 | ANALYSIS\n\nRobert Ayers. He had 1.5 sacks to raise his season total to eight, and he got three hits on Teddy Bridgewater. Since Jason Pierre-Paul returned to the lineup, Ayers\u2019 season has taken off. He has five sacks in his past four games and is going to give the Giants reason to consider bringing him back as part of their rebuild of the pass rush. -- Dan Graziano\n\nHarrison Smith. There were plenty of worthy candidates for the Vikings on Sunday night, but Smith gets the nod after bringing his 12th career interception back for his fourth career touchdown. His 35-yard return put the Vikings up 16-3, and after missing all but a handful of plays in the Vikings\u2019 past three games, Smith provided a reminder of why he\u2019s so valuable to the Vikings\u2019 defense. -- Ben Goessling\n\nBRONCOS 20, BENGALS 17, OT | ANALYSIS\n\nA.J. Green. He gets the game ball for his five-catch, 57-yard, one-touchdown performance in Monday night\u2019s game. His first-quarter touchdown reception featured some solid toe-dragging, as he pulled off a highlight reel-worthy play. -- Coley Harvey\n\nBrock Osweiler. He led the Broncos on a 14-play, 61-yard drive to set up what would be Brandon McManus' 37-yard game-winning field goal. Osweiler finished 27-of-39 for 299 yards and a touchdown. -- Jeff Legwold", "Always memorable, Dave Henderson will be missed": "You know that players get older, that they can\u2019t forever be those guys you got to see on the field. Not even a player whose mannerisms you remember years later can last forever, not even a player who you found yourself liking for little more than their ready smile, only to find yourself rewarded by big hits and big plays as well.\n\nBut now that former big league outfielder Dave Henderson has passed away too soon at 57 and just a month after receiving a kidney transplant, I find myself responding to the news as the fan I was rather than as the writer I am now, the writer who might merely assess Henderson's accomplishments in reflecting on his passing.\n\nHenderson was a guy you remembered because you recognized him in an instant: He was the man wearing the biggest smile in the ballpark. Whether he was up to bat, chattering with the plate ump, in the field or in the dugout, Hendu stood out because he was always beaming. In a game reliably overstocked with dour players focused on execution and excellence, Henderson was the guy who looked like he was doing all that and having fun. As he told author Mike Sowell in \"One Pitch Away,\" a history of the 1986 postseason, \"I don't think you should have a stone face. ... I just don't take this baseball stuff too seriously.\"\n\nHenderson was by no means a perfect player, but he was often the right guy in the right place at the right time, as memorable in how he played as in what he did. I'd been spoiled as a kid by watching ultimate fly-ball catcher Dwayne Murphy glide around center for the A\u2019s, and Hendu seemed a bit busy out there by comparison, taking so many steps to cover ground that he looked like a spider crawling toward the gaps ... only to get to the ball just in time at the very moment when you started to worry he might not make it. It wasn\u2019t the stuff of highlight reels, but when I close my eyes, that\u2019s what I see in my mind -- Hendu, arriving in the nick of time.\n\nHe had that knack, which allowed him to deliver some impressive plays that were part of what made Hendu fun. After laboring in relative obscurity to sparse Seattle crowds for the better part of six seasons, an August 1986 swap provided him a chance to give Red Sox fans an unforgettable blast. Despite playing through a bum knee, Hendu hammered a forkball from Angels closer Donnie Moore for a two-out, two-run home run in the ninth inning of Game 5 in the American League Championship Series to help stave off elimination for a Boston club down three games to one. The Sox would come back to win the pennant -- but lose to the Mets in the World Series made famous by Bill Buckner\u2019s boot.\n\nFormer A's outfielder Dave Henderson takes the field in a 2014 reunion of the 1989 champions. Brian Bahr/Getty Images\n\nAs Hendu later said to Sowell, \"The biggest key is that there is no pressure at all, because guys aren't supposed to hit the [Dennis] Eckersleys and the [Tom] Henkes and guys like that. ... So when we strike out, we're supposed to. There's not really much pressure when you're supposed to make an out. And I guess I'm the only one who realizes that. So, I have a distinct advantage in that everybody else on the field is pressured, and I'm not. I'm the same old guy, and that makes me better.\"\n\nHendu was dumped off to the Giants in one of Sox GM Lou Gorman\u2019s more inexplicable deals less than a year later, after which he joined the 1988 A\u2019s as a free-agent find, providing them with a pleasant surprise in center field and his best season. He ripped 63 extra-base hits while setting career highs in batting, OBP and slugging -- he hit .304/.363/.525. And in one of those classic Tony La Russa lineup switches, halfway through the season the skipper dropped Hendu into the No. 2 hole, which helped kick the Bash Brothers lineup into overdrive. The team scored more than five runs per game down the stretch to power a return to the postseason. Here again, Hendu would be on the wrong end of one of the great World Series upsets, as those A\u2019s lost to the underdog Dodgers thanks in part to Kirk Gibson\u2019s Game 1 blast off Dennis Eckersley.\n\nHendu would finally get a ring the next season when the A\u2019s won the 1989 World Series, and he would be a first-time All-Star in 1991, when he hit a career-high 25 home runs. But time was already running short for him; he was in his age-32 season, and the next year he blew out a knee. He struggled through one more season with the A\u2019s before finishing his career with a single-season swan song with the Royals in 1994. He\u2019d later spend the better part of a decade working on Mariners TV and radio broadcasts, but he was also known for sharing his love of the game by running adult fantasy camps for the Athletics and Mariners, which helped cement the feeling that Hendu was one of those guys, someone who really was \u201cjust happy to be here\u201d -- around the game, on any terms, in every way, because it\u2019s baseball.\n\nI\u2019m thankful for the joy he gave me and gave us, as fans. Thanks to his readiness to talk to folks out in the bleachers, Hendu became popular almost immediately in Boston -- so much so that 60 fans signed a ball and sent it to him when he was traded away.\n\nCovering this game, there are people that you get to know a little or a lot, and then there are those that you wish you knew. Hendu is part of the latter group for me, and I'm the poorer for it.\n\nToday, we should try to be happy that he was, it seems, truly happy to be there, and we should remember the fun as well as the feats, the improbable career that helped put that big smile on his face. And we should lament that the game is a little bit worse off for his too-soon departure. Thank you, Dave Henderson, thank you and goodbye. You\u2019ll be missed.\n\nChristina Kahrl writes about MLB for ESPN. You can follow her on Twitter."}
