{"Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil outstanding vs Bournemouth": "Arsenal move to the top of the table with a game in hand, thanks to 2 goals at home against Bournemouth.\n\nArsenal put their sobering 4-0 Boxing Day defeat at Southampton behind them with a comfortable win over Bournemouth to go top of the Premier League.\n\nThe Gunners owed the result to a sparkling display from Mesut Ozil. Fatigue and rotation can sometimes mean these festive fixtures lack quality. Ozil single-handedly ensured that was not the case, producing a mesmerising display to ensure Arsenal had enough to see off Eddie Howe's men.\n\nFirst, his corner was powered home by Brazilian Gabriel Paulista. Then, the German played a stunning one-two with Olivier Giroud before doubling Arsenal's lead. Ozil's performance was one befitting of a player at the very top of the league.\n\nArsenal Arsenal AFC Bournemouth AFC Bournemouth 2 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nPlayer Ratings (1-10; 10=best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating):\n\nGK Petr Cech, 7 -- The ex-Chelsea stopper now stands alone as the record holder for most clean sheets in Premier League history, with a remarkable 170 shutouts. This wasn't a particularly taxing day for Cech, but his achievement is still worthy of note.\n\nDF Hector Bellerin, 7 -- He might have been hoping for a rest on Monday, but with Calum Chambers pressed into action in midfield and Mathieu Debuchy seemingly headed for the Arsenal exit, Bellerin was once again asked to patrol the right flank. There were no obvious signs of fatigue, with the Spaniard providing a typically energetic display.\n\nDF Per Mertesacker, 6-- After his disastrous display at Southampton, it was slightly surprising to see Mertesacker picked to start this game. He didn't begin well either, misplacing several simple early passes. His tricky day continued when he produced an extraordinary miss, nodding a rebound wide from just a few yards out. Defensively, at least, he was relatively solid.\n\nDF Gabriel Paulista, 8 -- This was an impressive outing from the defender who is close to completing his first year in north London. The Brazilian gave the Gunners the lead when he met Ozil's flighted corner to power home his first goal for the club. He was a threat all day, heading against the post from another corner shortly afterwards. He was reliable at the back too, producing one particularly superb block when Josh King raced clear on goal.\n\nDF Kieran Gibbs, 6 -- A rare rest for Nacho Monreal gave Gibbs his first Premier League start in his preferred position of left-back this season. He looked understandably rusty, but this could prove to be valuable game-time for Gibbs if he is called upon later this season.\n\nMF Calum Chambers, 7 -- In the absence of Mathieu Flamini, Chambers started as a holding midfielder for only the second time in his senior career. Although he lacks pace, that need not be an impediment to his success in the role -- the likes of Michael Carrick and Gareth Barry have shown that in the past. This was a decent showing from Arsenal's stand-in midfielder.\n\nMF Aaron Ramsey, 7 -- The Welshman did not allow a first half booking to deter him from producing his customary box-to-box display. If anything, he might have looked to curb his enthusiasm: Ramsey was throwing himself into tackles that, had they been ever so slightly mis-timed, might have resulted in a second yellow.\n\nMF Mesut Ozil, 9 -- Where would Arsenal be without Ozil? In a timid first half display from the Gunners, he produced several moments of magic that underlined his quality. First, he clipped a perfect pass into the path of Theo Walcott, who miscontrolled. Then, he sent in the corner from which Gabriel nodded Arsenal ahead. His set piece delivery was outstanding all day, which was particularly important given that Arsenal weren't quite at it in open play. In the second half, he added a goal of exquisite beauty, meeting a Giroud flick with an unusually composed finish. Right now, Ozil appears unstoppable.\n\nESPN FC's Steve Nicol sees Mesut Ozil breaking the Prem assist record but not necessarily winning the title.\n\nFW Theo Walcott, 7 -- The England forward's pace caused problems for the Bournemouth back line throughout the game, but unfortunately he could not find the finish to match his incisive runs. However, this was a solid all-round display -- since returning to the wing, Walcott appears to have doubled his defensive efforts.\n\nFW Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, 6 -- Worked hard to combat his lack of confidence, yet didn't really impact the game as he would have hoped. There was nothing in his performance to suggest he might reclaim his place above Joel Campbell in the Arsenal pecking order.\n\nFW Olivier Giroud, 7 -- The greatest facet of Giroud's game is his ability to link the play with delicate flicks, and he showcased that brilliantly with the assist for Ozil's goal. It's not the first time a sumptuous dink from Giroud has created a goal for a teammate, and it probably won't be the last. That was a sublime piece of skill that deserves as much recognition as the unerring finish.\n\nSubstitutes:\n\nFW Joel Campbell, NR -- Replaced Giroud in the 80th minute and worked hard as ever to help the Gunners protect their lead.\n\nDF Nacho Monreal NR -- Came on for Gibbs in the 81st minute to help shore up the Arsenal defence.\n\nMF Alex Iwobi, NR -- A stoppage time replacement for Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n\nJames McNicholas is a football writer and the man behind Arsenal blog Gunnerblog.com.

The embattled manager has been the subject of intense speculation over the past few weeks during the Christmas season, as there is no room for festive cheer in the boardroom during the holidays. While Tiny Tim may have proclaimed \"God bless us, every one\" in A Christmas Carol, for football managers, \"God help us\" is more to the point, as former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho and under-fire Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal can testify.\n\nThe former has been inevitably linked with a return to the Bernabeu but appears to prefer to wait for the latter's post to be vacated, much to the relief of the Bernabeu dressing room, it's safe to assume. So far in Spain only Zaragoza manager Ranko Popovic has been handed his marching orders, and that was with his side sixth in Segunda. There's something about a New Year -- out with the old and all that -- that leads to club boards making changes.\n\nWith one game to go until 2016, Benitez could be forgiven for looking over his shoulder. The Real manager cited a media campaign in his pre-match news conference ahead of the visit of Real Sociedad on Wednesday.\n\nIt is certainly true that the Spanish sports media have a tendency to blow anything out of proportion, especially when there is little newsworthy going on. The holidays have provided the perfect opportunity to fan the flames of discontent, eliciting a wonderful response from Benitez: \"It seems like a tweet rocks the foundations of the country.\" During the shortened winter break, AS ran a front page story under the rather bombastic headline \"Benitez, in his bunker.\"\n\n\"Man spends Christmas at home with his family\" would have been more accurate, but while other leagues feast on festive football, Spain traditionally shuts down leaving the media with scraps.\n\nOn Wednesday, mercifully, La Liga returns. Spain head coach Vicente del Bosque was made a marquis for delivering the World Cup, but he should be knighted for sparing the country another week without domestic football by requesting a shorter season with the Euros in mind. For Benitez, it is also a God-send. The Spaniard has said on many occasions that the only way to answer his critics is on the pitch. The visit of Real Sociedad is a timely opportunity to do just that.\n\nDespite an eye-catching 4-2 victory against Carlo Ancelotti's side at the start of last season, the Basque club have not prospered at the Bernabeu since their return to the Primera in 2010. The past five matches between the sides in Madrid since then have ended 4-1, 5-1, 4-3, 5-1 and 4-1. Benitez, however, will be eager to break the statistic of away goals in that sequence. During the early part of the season he was able highlight Real's watertight defence, but in recent weeks that bastion of his reign has been deconstructed brick by brick. In the opening 12 games of the season Real kept nine clean sheets. In the 11 since then, the side has managed three. During that run, Real shipped three in Sevilla, four in the Clasico, three against Shakhtar and singles against Las Palmas, Getafe and Villarreal.\n\nMore than focus on the number of goals going in at the other end, Benitez must address the team's weaknesses at the back. Set pieces remain the Achilles' heel but a general lack of cohesion is a more worrying trait this season. Players are not tracking opposition runners, organization in the area has been amateurish at times and there are too many spaces behind the full-backs. Keylor Navas' expression after Rayo's second goal in the last league fixture said it all. And despite the eventual 10-2 scoreline, Paco Jemez's adventurous cut-price outfit were the better side when it was 11 against 11.\n\nWith rumours swirling about his future at the club, Real Madrid manager Rafa Benitez will want a strong start from his team vs. Real Sociedad.\n\nLa Real present a similar, if not as aggressive, proposition. The Txuriurdin have enjoyed a slight upturn in fortunes since Eusebio Sacristan replaced David Moyes in November, even if their league position hasn't improved. Wins over Sevilla and Eibar were balanced by defeats to Barcelona and Villarreal, but the key difference of Eusebio's approach so far has been possession: 60 percent against Sevilla, 65 percent against Eibar, 58 percent against Getafe and 66 percent against Villarreal. Moyes averaged 51 percent.\n\nReal's counter-punches will be key to unsettling the visitors' rhythm and the front three of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale all filled their boots against Rayo. The match may have been a farce -- with Rayo playing with nine men for more than an hour -- but the effect of goals on a forward should not be underestimated. Bale doubled his tally for the season in just 45 minutes.\n\nBut Real will have plenty to do at the other end on Wednesday. Imanol Agirretxe has bagged 12 goals in 14 La Liga appearances this season and Eusebio's side have plenty of pace on the break through striker Jonathas and wingers Carlos Vela and Bruma, as well as a solid midfield anchored by Asier Illarramandi and Ruben Pardo. Sergio Canales and Xabi Prieto provide the vision.\n\nIt would be no surprise, even to Isco, to see Casemiro preferred to Toni Kroos in midfield, but Raphael Varane could be the key player for the home side. The France international has just recovered from a muscle strain and should replace Sergio Ramos, who has been struggling for fitness all season and has been ruled out with a calf problem.\n\nVarane's speed, ability to read a pass and the invaluable cover he provides for the full-backs will be needed against a side that can do plenty of damage on the wings. Nacho would be a safer option given Varane's recent fragility but Benitez cannot afford to take risks. Rayo showed what a fast, attacking side are capable of doing at the Bernabeu. Another 30 minutes like that on Wednesday and Benitez really will be on the ropes.\n\nRob Train is a freelance writer who lives in Madrid, covers Real Madrid for ESPN and contributes to a number of other publications. Twitter: @Cafc13Rob.", "Bayern supremacy Dortmund revival Chicharito goal Bundesliga": "No one has been able to keep pace with Bayern Munich this term, as they already hold an eight-point advantage over second-place Borussia Dortmund.\n\nAs the Bundesliga season reaches the winter break, Raphael Honigstein looks back on the highlights and lowlights so far and suggests what might happen next.\n\nThe season so far\n\nThe first half of 2015-16 hasn't deviated too much from the wider, familiar story of recent years. At the very top, Bayern Munich have again been in a class of their own under Pep Guardiola. The Catalan's hunger to win every single game remains undiminished, and so is his team's: it was striking to see Bayern throw men forward with almost reckless abandon in the dying minutes of the match vs. Eintracht Frankurt, all in order to avoid their first draw of the season after 10 wins in a row.\n\nBorussia Dortmund, reinstated as one of Europe's best attacking sides under Thomas Tuchel, did their best to keep up but couldn't quite go the distance. Tuchel's first months in charge have been a triumph of many small tweaks, on and off the pitch, nevertheless.\n\nBelow them, Champions League teams Bayer Leverkusen (fifth) and Wolfsburg (seventh) struggled to find consistency, while Schalke 04 (sixth) showed signs of improvement under new coach Andre Breitenreiter without being fully convincing. All three of them are further away than ever from challenging for the title.\n\nThe only top side satisfied with their achievements below Bayern and Dortmund are Borussia Monchengladbach, even if they got to fourth place in the most unusual way. Lucien Favre, the architect of their renaissance, jumped ship after five defeats on the bounce; his successor, Andre Schubert, couldn't stop winning and took the Foals all the way from last place to the top again.\n\nIn midtable, clever Mainz (eighth) continue to outperform relative to their wage bill with Martin Schmidt in charge; and 1.FC Koln (ninth) are having a solid season under Peter Stoger; as are, at last, Hamburger SV and Bruno Labbadia (10th). The wider trend of small teams doing well at the expense of some of the more traditional teams is once again reflected by the good starts of Ingolstadt and Darmstadt to life in the top flight, as well as Augsburg's remarkable recovery after a difficult start and fixture congestion due to their first-ever participation in the Europa League.\n\nWith the minnows doing so well, there's no cushion that will save the likes of misfiring Frankfurt (14th), VfB Stuttgart (15th), Werder Bremen (16th) and Hannover 96 (17th) from the drop. They're all in a lot of trouble, alongside TSG Hoffenheim (18th), whose travails weren't expected. Whether Huub Stevens can steer them to safety with his pragmatic tactics remains to be seen.\n\nThere's been only one truly big surprise: nobody could have foreseen Hertha BSC finishing the calendar year in third place. Pal Dardai's men have decent goal scorers in Salomon Kalou and Vedad Ibisevic, decent midfielders (Vladimir Darida) and a serviceable defence; but as a collective, they've been incredibly tricky to beat and at the same time freakishly efficient up front. Can they keep it up after the winter break? It's hard to back them in light of the quality of the teams immediately below them in the table, but being able to dream about a second outing in the Champions League after 1999-2000 should be considered a fantastic achievement in itself.\n\nBest player: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Borussia Dortmund\n\nEasy: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has made another huge jump in terms of development. The Gabon striker has scored 27 goals in all competitions, 18 of them in the Bundesliga. Aubameyang, still only 26, has thrived under the more considered build-up of Tuchel; he can time his incredibly fast runs between defenders better and doesn't need to chase as many balls into the channels. The results of this \"less is more\" approach have been nothing but spectacular.\n\nMost disappointing player: Arturo Vidal, Bayern Munich\n\nArturo Vidal has struggled to adapt to life at Bayern, but he's only been disappointing in terms of his own ability. Gladbach's Josip Drmic, however, has been a flop in absolute terms. There's just no way around it. One goal and only three starts raise suspicions that the usually infallible Foals sporting director Max Eberl might have got it wrong, for once.\n\nJavier Hernandez has proved to be the best signing in the Bundesliga this season, providing Bayer Leverkusen with tremendous value for money.\n\nBest signing: Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez, Bayer Leverkusen\n\nIn a year in which the whole of Europe were looking for wide players, Bayern did extremely well to get in Douglas Costa (Shakhtar Donetsk) and Kingsley Coman (Juventus) for relatively little money. Leverkusen recruiting Javier Hernandez was even more of a masterstroke. The Mexican has scored 19 goals in 25 matches across all competitions and also put his club on the map in the Americas. All for \u20ac11 million.\n\nBiggest surprises\n\nHertha, as mentioned above, as club performances go. German FA president Wolfgang Niersbach resigning after revelations about Germany's 2006 World Cup bid was a huge shock to the system, Guardiola telling Bayern he's off in the summer less so. Newly promoted Ingolstadt and Darmstadt have done better than anticipated.\n\nBest goal: Robert Lewandowski, Bayern Munich vs. Wolfsburg\n\nDortmund scored a number of superbly crafted team goals but Robert Lewandowski's volley, his fifth strike in nine minutes, in the 5-1 victory over VfL Wolfsburg was the outstanding individual effort.\n\nBest game, Bayer Leverkusen 4-3 Stuttgart\n\nWith the home side coming back from being down 2-0 and 3-1 to get an 89th-minute-winner via Admir Mehmedi was the most spectacular game, followed by the helter-skelter 3-3 draw played out by Hoffenheim and Gladbach.\n\nPrediction for the rest of the season\n\nDortmund will win the Europa League in the final against J\u00fcrgen Klopp's Liverpool. Bayern Munich will win the Champions League final against Manchester City. Leverkusen will win the DFB Pokal. Hertha will finish in the Europa League, Werder and Hoffenheim will go down.\n\nRaphael Honigstein is ESPN FC's German football expert and a regular guest on ESPN FC TV.

But where will he end up next season?\n\nEditor's note: This piece was first published on Dec. 16 and has been updated to reflect Pep Guardiola's decision to leave Bayern this summer, Jose Mourinho's exit and Guus Hiddink's interim appointment at Chelsea.\n\nMUNICH -- Among the myriad things on offer at Bayern Munich's fan shop at the Allianz Arena is an illustrated advent calendar for kids with chocolate stars behind every window. Supporters of the German champions won't quite have to wait until Christmas for the biggest reveal of all, however: the club have already made an announcement on the future of Pep Guardiola.\n\nNow that Guardiola has told the club that his days in Germany will come to an end in May, the speculation about his next career move will go into overdrive. Here, then, is a look at the likely destinations for the world's most sought-after football manager.\n\nWould Arsenal part ways with Arsene Wenger for Pep Guardiola?\n\nArsenal\n\nSources close to the 42-year-old believe that living in London would be hugely appealing to Guardiola and his family. \"Footballistically,\" as Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger would say, the Gunners would seem a natural fit for him as well. Among all the Premier League clubs, they play a brand of possession-oriented, short-passing football that's closest to the Guardiola blueprint, at least as far as the attack is concerned. Without the ball, Arsenal don't employ any of the systematic, concerted pressing in the opposition half that has been a key component of Guardiola's transformative success at Barcelona and Bayern.\n\nArsenal don't need a serious overhaul, only a few tweaks and expensive strategic additions. What they will require, however, is a new, more flexible mindset -- Guardiola expects his team to vary their approach and formations in accordance with the specific needs of every single game -- and a much harder dressing room culture in which any finish short of titles and trophies will be considered a grave disappointment.\n\nThe key question is whether the club itself would buy into the Catalan's obsession with winning, and the various demands, in terms of set-up and transfer-market dealings, it entails. All the indications are that owner Stan Kroenke is entirely happy with the stability and financial prudence under Wenger and not at all in the market for a more driven manager. Wenger's current good run in the league and his strong power base make Guardiola's arrival next summer more unprobable still. He might be persuaded to spend a year on sabbatical, waiting for Wenger's contract to run out in 2017, but who at the Emirates has either the mandate or the courage to make such an offer as long as Wenger is around? The answer is: no one.\n\nChances of Guardiola taking over Arsenal in 2016: In Wenger they still trust.\n\nChelsea\n\nIt's almost forgotten now, but when Jose Mourinho, the self-proclaimed \"Happy One,\" returned to Stamford Bridge in 2013, he found that all the furniture had been rearranged by owner Roman Abramovich in anticipation of another co-habitant. The squad list then was a thinly disguised love letter to Guardiola, drafted to entice the Catalan to West London. But it was Mourinho who ended up in charge of a side that had become much more technical, with more flair players, since his departure six years earlier.\n\nElements of Chelsea's current malaise can be traced back to that mismatch. Mourinho has always preferred soldiers to artists. Even though the Blues won the Premier League without breaking into much of a sweat last season, this campaign has seen the worst of both worlds. Creative players such as Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas have underperformed dramatically, and the much more physical threat of Nemanja Matic, Diego Costa and co has been greatly diminished, too. Chelsea, on the whole, are low on inspiration.\n\nMourinho has now paid the price for a disastrous season with Guus Hiddink arriving until the end of the season, but there's seemingly little to attract Guardiola to the job. The squad need loads of work, Chelsea might soon be playing their home games at the cold and corporate Wembley, and the supporters would continue to sing the praises of Mourinho, his arch enemy, at the merest hint of a defeat. Add a volatile owner and no Champions League for next season (unless they win the current edition, which is very unlikely), and what you have is not exactly a compelling proposition.\n\nChances of Guardiola taking over Chelsea in 2016: Bit of a long shot.\n\nManchester City\n\nIn the spring of this year, sources close to owner Sheikh Mansour revealed that Guardiola had agreed to take over from current manager Manuel Pellegrini at the start of the 2015/16 season. Guardiola, however, stayed in Munich, and Pellegrini's contract was renewed for another year.\n\nThe \"Guardiola to Man City\" rumour kicked into high gear again this autumn, with a slight change of starting date (2016/17) amid reports of contracts being signed.\n\nThere's no doubt that Guardiola enjoys an excellent working relationship with Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano, the former Barcelona officials now occupying the roles of director of football and CEO, respectively, at the Etihad. And there's no doubt that both of them have been trying hard to lure him to Man City. What's far less clear is the question of any firm agreement being in place.\n\nWhat's more, seasoned Guardiola watchers in Spain talk of his capriciousness and note that he has disappointed associates with last-minute changes of plan before.\n\nThat said, the combination of a weak incumbent coach, vast resources to create a second Barcelona and people he trusts at board level, still makes City the most realistic prospect. The squad, centre-backs aside, has been significantly rejuvenated and refreshed this summer, and Guardiola's presence would not only provide a huge upgrade on existing and former managers but also add a significant amount of star dust that neither Roberto Mancini nor Pellegrini possesses. Getting Guardiola is seen as a short cut to becoming an elite club, both in terms of perception and output, which explains why City are pushing so hard.\n\nChances of Guardiola taking over Manchester City in 2016: His most realistic next destination.\n\nESPN FC's Gab Marcotti shares his insight on Pep Guardiola's managerial future and his options to consider.\n\nManchester United\n\nIn Marti Perarnau's seminal account of Guardiola's first season at Bayern, \"Pep Confidential,\" the manager talks of his admiration and respect for England's record champions. This has led to plenty of speculation over the years, and these particular flames have been further fanned by sources at Bayern, who believe that United, due to their heritage and status, would be a better fit for the manager after Barcelona and Munich than, say, Man City.\n\nFollowing in Louis van Gaal's footsteps for a third time -- the Dutchman laid much of the groundwork for Bayern's step up the food chain in recent years -- would make sense at a tactical level, but it's fair to say that United's progress has been much slower than anticipated. United would likely welcome Guardiola with a bulging war chest, but does the club have the competence to target the right players beyond the three or four superstars Ed Woodward has been trying to sign, to no avail, since the end of the Ferguson era?\n\nGiven the recent tumult at United, the club have become a bigger challenge to put right than their neighbours City. Guardiola would effectively embark on a rebuilding project and shelve any ideas about winning the Champions League for at least a couple of years. For all the glamour and romance of being manager at Old Trafford, it's not the most attractive scenario right now.\n\nChances of Guardiola taking over at Manchester United in 2016: Plenty of appeal for Pep, but City still the better bet.\n\nRaphael Honigstein is ESPN FC's German football expert and a regular guest on ESPN FC TV. He also writes for the Guardian. Twitter: @honigstein.", "Watford tough loss to Spurs but Odion Ighalo excels": "Tottenham emerged the victor in a 2-1 thriller against Watford, thanks to a back-heel goal from Son Heung-Min.\n\nESPN FC's Tommy Smyth shares his insight on Tottenham Hotspur's important win against Watford in the Premier League.\n\nWhen the referee whistled for full-time at Vicarage Road on Monday, Quique Sanchez Flores walked straight onto the pitch to help Odion Ighalo back to his feet. Watford's striker was lying on his back, utterly exhausted and devastated by the result. His team's fine run of form had just been ended in the cruelest fashion as Spurs scored a late winner in their 2-1 win.\n\nConceding in the last minute is a horrible way to lose any game but it was all the more heart-breaking for Watford because of the effort they'd shown in the final 30 minutes after being reduced to 10 men. Nathan Ake was shown a straight red for his high challenge on Eric Lamela and while Watford's players were clearly angered by the decision, they used their frustration to fuel their performance. They even looked more likely to score in the closing stages of the game.\n\nThe fixtures played in between Boxing Day and New Year's Day are always brutal for the players and standards inevitably drop off a little. For this reason it's difficult to read too much into these games. However, much has been said about Mauricio Pochettino's new-look Spurs team and how they must be taken seriously. On yesterday's showing they were only marginally the better side.\n\nPochettino's tactics had Watford on the back foot in the first half but as the game wore on, the home team were more aggressive and determined despite their numerical disadvantage. Most managers sacrifice a forward when a player is dismissed, but Flores kept both his strikers on for the duration of the game.\n\nSpurs will be hailed for showing winning instinct in difficult circumstances. But had they not scored a fortuitous winner -- Heung-Min Son was offside when the ball was initially crossed into Watford's area -- the reaction would have been entirely different. For that reason Watford should not be too downtrodden. They were very close to claiming another fantastic result which is further proof that this team is for real. The only concern now is whether they have anything left in the tank for the visit of Manchester City on Monday.\n\nWatford Watford Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham Hotspur 1 2 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10=best; players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating):\n\nGK Heurelho Gomes, 7 -- A solid display but could have caught a couple that he punched clear.\n\nDF Ikechi Anya, 6 -- Right-back is not his natural position and it showed. No howlers, but he struggled to get out of his own half and create overlaps for Almen Abdi.\n\nDF Craig Cathcart, 5 -- A forgettable day for one of Watford's most reliable players. Committed a horrendous error that resulted in Spurs' opener when he was ponderous in possession and lost the ball to Eric Lamela. It was his only mistake but a very costly one.\n\nDF Miguel Britos, 8 -- Another excellent display until he was substituted in the second half, presumably due to injury.\n\nDF Nathan Ake, 6 -- It was turning into another excellent display from Ake before his red card. The decision to show a straight red was contentious but there is always a risk with any high challenge. Watford will miss his qualities at left-back as he serves his suspension.\n\nTroy Deeney and Odion Ighalo asked constant questions of the Spurs defence but couldn't prevent a tough defeat.\n\nMF Almen Abdi, 5 -- Very quiet by his standards. Watford rarely offered much threat down the right so it was little surprise that he was substituted at half-time.\n\nMF Ben Watson, 8 -- Another tireless display from Watson, whose influence grew as the game wore on.\n\nMF Etienne Capoue, 8 -- Like Watson, his presence grew in the second half. Never stops running and always tries to use the ball intelligently; what a player he would be if he could shoot.\n\nMF Jose Manuel Jurado, 6 -- The effort was there but this wasn't Jurado's day. There were only a handful of times when he was able to double up with Ake down Watford's left and when he tried to create on his own, he found himself outnumbered and out muscled.\n\nFW Odion Ighalo, 8 -- A phenomenal effort that warranted a better result. Chased everything, bullied his marker and scored another goal from nothing, forcing his way past the Spurs defence to score when there appeared to be no way through.\n\nFW Troy Deeney, 7 -- Worked just as hard as his strike partner but struggled to get on the ball often enough to create chances.\n\nSubstitutes:\n\nMF Valon Behrami, 6 -- Replaced Abdi at half-time and provided more energy but created little.\n\nDF Sebastian Prodl, 7 -- Replaced Britos in the second half. It is difficult for centre-backs to join a game and settle in quickly but Prodl looked calm having been out of the side for a long time.\n\nDF Allan Nyom 6 -- Replaced Jurado with Anya moving to the left wing and Nyom replacing him at right-back.\n\nMichael blogs about Watford for ESPN FC and occasionally writes about other teams on Regista-Blog Follow on Twitter: @Regista_Michael.", "Borussia Dortmund loss at Cologne see Joo Ho Park struggle": "Borussia Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel says he is unlikely to make any moves in the January transfer window.\n\nThe winter break came nine minutes too late for Borussia Dortmund, who lost their last match of 2015, 2-1, to Cologne after holding a lead for 64 minutes.

He was lucky that the referee Knut Kircher overlooked a clear penalty when Park brought down Pawel Olkowski.\n\nJoo-Ho Park lasted only the first 45 minutes for Dortmund.\n\nDF Mats Hummels, 7 -- The team captain is back to form and once again showed his leadership on the field.

He won all of his challenges on the pitch -- on the ground and in the air.\n\nDF Matthias Ginter, 5 -- The right back contributed to Dortmund's attacking play, as long as Dortmund's attacking play lasted.\n\nMF Ilkay Gundogan, 3 -- If there is any example as to why Borussia Dortmund are in dire need of a break, look no further Gundogan, whose form has been consistently deteriorating. His performance against Cologne was reminiscent of his performances towards the end of last season, where he simply ran out of steam. Gundogan looked horribly off the pace in this match and could hardly help his team, as he was too easily hassled off the ball in the second half.\n\nMF Julian Weigl, 5 -- Dortmund's structured build up play depends on Weigl, and when it got scrappy Weigl did his best to stay calm in holding midfield. But he looked left alone by his teammates as Cologne pressed higher up the pitch.\n\nMF Henrikh Mkhitaryan, 4 -- As always, Mkhitaryan tried hard and skipped past defenders, but there was always one man too many for him to beat. Lacked the usual sharpness upfront against a well-organized Cologne defence. It's nothing to worry about.\n\nMF Shinji Kagawa, 3 -- The Japanese lacked the precision upfront that was necessary to create more chances against a side that fielded three centre-backs from the outset. The playmaker failed to deliver against Cologne and would have been a candidate for a substitution.\n\nMF Jonas Hofmann, 4 -- It may have been a surprise to see Hofmann play instead of Gonzalo Castro, but the 23-year-old had a decent performance until his substitution. He created the biggest opportunity BVB had in the second half by himself, but his shot was blocked by a last-ditch tackle. As so often happens, Hofmann failed to put the lid on promising situations.\n\nFW Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, 2 -- It was a difficult match for any striker, but Aubameyang didn't do much to help his case in this match. He wasn't completely uninvolved in the match, but his first touch wasn't sharp enough to help his team. It goes without saying that the necessary service for a striker to shine wasn't provided by his team, who was mostly on the back foot after taking the lead.\n\nSubstitutes:\n\nDF, Marcel Schmelzer, 7 -- The left-back wasn't fit enough to play a whole match, but Tuchel had to bring him at half-time due to Park's horrific display. As per usual, the experienced Schmelzer played well, but it was his failed clearance in the 90th minute that landed in the back of his net just seconds later. Aubameyang was caught napping and Frederik Sorensen showed determination as he headed Schmelzer's clearance back right in front of Anthony Modeste, who tucked it away. One of many details that decided the outcome.\n\nDF Sven Bender, 6 -- \"He isn't 100 percent fit\", Tuchel said ahead of the match, but the manager had to bring him in for the injured Hummels. Bender had one blip in the match, but immediately corrected his error. One can only be thankful that he didn't pick up a severe injury within the 45 minutes.\n\nFW Adrian Ramos, NR -- The Colombian replaced Hofmann in the 75th minute. It's hard to say what Tuchel intended with the switch, but it didn't work out. BVB failed to take control of the match in the second half and Ramos couldn't contribute anything to help the matter. It was a wasted substitution by Tuchel.\n\nStefan Buczko writes about Dortmund and is a co-host of The Yellowwallpod.

However, the club have wasted no time in replacing the most-sought-after coach in the game with a man close behind him: Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nHere are six things the Italian needs to do next summer:\n\nFocus on the Champions League\n\nEuropean success is where it's at for Ancelotti at Bayern. Such is the quality of the squad, the German champions would almost be guaranteed to challenge domestically even with an unknown coach in charge. Indeed, the team could almost run itself in the Bundesliga, without a coach to overcomplicate the smooth running of the Bavarian machinery.\n\nWith Bayern already looking good to clinch a fourth consecutive Bundesliga title next year, Ancelotti will be forgiven any domestic slip in the pursuit of European honours. The Holy Grail is always the Champions League, and the Italian has the highest European pedigree, as a proven winner at two different clubs in Europe's elite club competition: AC Milan (twice) and Real. Plus, he outcoached Guardiola in the 2014 Champions League semifinal, winning 5-0 on aggregate en route to La Decima with Real Madrid.\n\nMake his mark on the club\n\nUnlike Guardiola, Ancelotti is not known for playing players out of position or constantly chopping and changing systems. The 4-3-2-1 is his favoured system, but at Real this turned into a fluid 4-3-3 with the BBC trio (Bale, Benzema and Cristiano) running riot at the height of their success.\n\nUnlike the traditional Italian style of Catenaccio, Ancelotti likes to play free-flowing attacking football wherever possible. However, it'll surely be useful that many of Bayern's recent signings have a background in Italy's Serie A, such as Medhi Benatia, Arturo Vidal and Kingsley Coman.\n\n\"Carlo's a calm, balanced and proven expert, who knows how to deal with stars and favours a multifaceted playing style -- we were seeking this and we've found it,\" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said upon his appointment. Could this be a sly dig at Guardiola for coming up short in two consecutive Champions League semifinals? For all the wonderful passing football, you'd have to say Guardiola's Bayern have been a little bit predictable and naive against the counterattack when it really matters most. Something Ancelotti will look to rectify.\n\nGet the best out of Kingsley Coman\n\nAncelotti will be no stranger to gifted French teenager Coman, having handed him his league debut in France in 2013 while in charge of Paris St-Germain. The Italian threw Coman into the Ligue 1 fray at the tender age of 16, making him the youngest player in PSG history at the time.\n\nHaving said Coman is \"quick but also very intelligent\" in the past, Ancelotti will want the 19-year-old to step up considering the extensive injury problems of aging wide men Arjen Robben (31) and Franck Ribery (32). His accomplished performances on either wing have been a breath of fresh air to Bayern this season, and Ancelotti will surely give Coman regular chances to impress and trust that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 continues to come of age in Bavaria.\n\nMake Alonso central to Bayern's midfield\n\nSpain World Cup winner Xabi Alonso is another player Ancelotti will know all about. Alonso was in the Liverpool side that gave the Italian his worst moment as a coach in 2005. In one of the most high-profile comebacks of all time, the Reds rebounded from a 3-0 half-time deficit to win the Champions League on penalties against Ancelotti's AC Milan in Istanbul.\n\nThe Italian will have much more pleasant memories of the midfielder starring for him en route to Real Madrid's Decima. It's surely not a coincidence that Alonso extended his deal till 2017 on Friday. Bastian Schweinsteiger left for Manchester United basically because he was no longer guaranteed regular game time at Bayern, so it's highly unlikely Alonso, at 34, would have agreed to prolong his stay without being secure in the knowledge that Ancelotti was on his way to Bavaria and that he would still be a figurehead in the team.\n\nAs a player, Ancelotti won the European Cup twice with AC Milan, acting as a deep-lying midfielder and protecting the defence. Surely this is the role that Ancelotti has in mind for Alonso at Bayern, especially in Europe.\n\nBayern have been boosted with four key players signing new contracts ahead of the midseason break.\n\nFix the injury situation\n\nYou can't promise Bayern won't suffer the same extent of injuries as they have under Guardiola, but one thing is for sure: Ancelotti will aim for a much more fruitful relationship with the medical team.\n\nPep fell out with former medic Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt over last season's injury crisis and Kicker reported this week that Bayern's overworked medical team, most notably Dr. Volker Braun, have once again incurred Guardiola's wrath over the club's current list. Reportedly key to this was getting Ribery back into the fray (after nine months out) on the evidence of just two full training sessions; after two brief cameos, the Frenchman soon succumbed to a fresh injury on his comeback and faces an uncertain future.\n\nYou just cannot see the laid-back Ancelotti getting his feathers ruffled by things that he cannot control.\n\nLearn the language\n\nThe communication barrier shouldn't be much to overcome for Ancelotti. \"If [ex-Bayern coach and fellow Italian] Giovanni Trapattoni can learn German, so can I,\" he joked earlier this week. Whenever he has coached abroad, Ancelotti has quickly grasped the lingo in Spain, England or France; Germany will be no different.\n\nAncelotti has been enjoying a Guardiola-style sabbatical since being unceremoniously dumped by Real Madrid, and no doubt has been intensely cramming German in his downtime. He will have been aware of the need to learn German -- if not for training, at least for regular media duties -- and hopefully, he can follow in the great tradition of emotional Italian news conferences in Munich.\n\nMark Lovell is a Germany-based journalist who covers the Bundesliga for ESPN FC and BBC Sport.

Oscar is fine though.\"\n\nMikel believes United, who have been criticised for only scoring 10 goals in their last 14 games, may have been fearful when they had the opportunity to trouble Chelsea.\n\n\"I think sometimes you could see in the game that they had chances to attack, but were a little bit sceptical, or hesitant,\" he added.\n\nChelsea's John Obi Mikel said Wayne Rooney should have seen red for his challenge on Oscar.\n\n\"Maybe they were a little bit scared. They were playing not to lose as well. Because of the fast players we have up front who can break they were cautious, and approached the game not to lose.\n\n\"Both teams are not in the right place right now to attack, attack, attack, attack. Sometimes you have to be smart and settle for a point.\"\n\nThe midfielder also revealed that the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge has improved since Mourinho's departure.\n\nHiddink is taking charge of Chelsea on an interim basis for the second time following a successful three-month spell in 2009.\n\nMikel said: \"He hasn't changed much yet, but he was here before and he knows the place and all the staff. The players are different -- only me and JT (Terry) -- were here before, but he knows what to do.\n\n\"We're down there in the table for a reason so he can't come in and perform miracles, but we want to get out of there. We've had three games now without losing so are making the right steps.\n\nMikel said he was as perplexed as anyone as to why Chelsea have struggled so far this season, but added that it was hard to tell as he'd spent much of the season on Jose Mourinho's bench.\n\n\"We've moved on from that and the atmosphere has improved since the change of manager. It's fine now, we've just not been getting results.\n\n\"Jose is a fantastic manager and will always be a fantastic guy. But sometimes football is a cruel game and you have to move on. Is it the right decision? Who knows? We'll only see in the future.''\n\nMikel, meanwhile, thinks a top-four finish is still within Chelsea's grasp despite the huge points differential.\n\n\"I don't think it's gone yet,'' he said. \"We've got a lot of games left to play and points to catch up. If we keep going in this direction and keep keeping clean sheets then we'll definitely score goals.''\n\n\"He came back to the club a second time and won two trophies, but now he's gone and we have to move on. Is it the right decision? Who knows? We'll only see in the future.\"\n\nChelsea lost nine of their first 16 league games, leaving Mikel struggling to explain why they had floundered this season.\n\n\"I've been as confused as everyone else,\" he said. \"It's difficult when you're not playing, as you don't really know what the problems are.\n\n\"I wasn't playing that much under Mourinho so couldn't put my finger on what was going wrong. It was a collective thing -- the players and the manager were not performing.\"", "Rafa Benitez says Real Madrid are victims of media campaign": "The Real Madrid Foundation presented its annual charity campaign, 'No child without a toy at Christmas' at Bernabeu.\n\nReal Madrid coach Rafa Benitez says that speculation he could be sacked after Wednesday afternoon's La Liga game at home to Real Sociedad is fuelled by a local media \"campaign\" against both him and club president Florentino Perez.\n\nWith Benitez's future being widely questioned around the Spanish capital, there has been mounting speculation that the now-available Jose Mourinho could be back in the Bernabeu hotseat as early as this week.\n\nMadrid's players are also reportedly unhappy with Benitez's methods, with AS claiming that while Benitez was spending Christmas with his family on Merseyside, dressing room heavyweights spoke with B-team coach Zinedine Zidane about stepping up to the first team job.\n\nThe Blancos coach told his pregame news conference that much of the news coverage of the club and his position was \"invented and manipulated.\"\n\n\"What is clear is that, there is a campaign against Florentino, against Real Madrid, against the coach of Real Madrid,\" he said. \"From there, all that can be criticised is criticised, and then there are things invented and manipulated.\n\n\"Anyone with experience can see that. Many people question my CV, after spending 11 years outside Spain. But we all know we must do a bit more, starting from me, then see what success comes. And judgement will happen at the end of the season.\"\n\nBenitez also rejected local media reports that he has had trouble with players including Sergio Ramos, Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez, Marcelo, Karim Benzema, Isco and Jese.\n\n\"The relationship with the squad is infinitely better than what you read in the papers,\" he said. \"Among a squad of 24 there are some players who are happier than others, but that happens in every club.\n\n\"It seems that every technical decision is a personal call against the player -- and speculation starts from there. The campaign is clear, anyone can see that.\n\n\"I cannot play with 12, but interpretation taken depends on whether you want to do damage or not. I cannot lose time on that, must focus on getting performance from my team.\"\n\nRafa Benitez has reportedly fallen out with a number of Real Madrid stars including Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nThere was tumult before the winter break at the Bernabeu during the 10-2 defeat of Rayo Vallecano, with Madrid fans whistling their own team at 2-1 down, and then cheering on the visitors' nine men at times in the second half.\n\n\"The team has done some things well, so they won many games,\" he said. \"And some things not so well. They must focus on tomorrow's game. We must motivate the fans with our good play, attitude and commitment.\n\n\"That is what Real Madrid fans want; nothing else. I have spoken about the words of the club anthem -- we must play well, work hard, win games. The fans must help us, and they will help us.\"\n\nBenitez said he had not been worried about his future as speculation had raged about Mourinho and Zidane as he spent the winter break in England with his family.\n\n\"I was with my family, relaxed at home, nothing else,\" he said. \"They were short holidays, as playing on Dec. 30 changes things. But I enjoyed the short time I had with my family.\n\n\"Fortunately the English press does not exaggerate so much like here where every tweet it seems the country's foundations are shaking. I was just thinking about what to do to beat Real Sociedad, and then to win trophies this year, and all years we can be here.\"\n\nOther reports that the club had surveyed supporters to get views on potential replacements were also played down by Benitez.\n\nRaul spoke about the possibility of becoming Real Madrid manager, yet for now says he's happy in New York.\n\n\"From the start I knew I was coming to such a big club, where everything is magnified, for good or bad,\" he said. \"[Such surveys] happen every month, but this time the media publishes it for their own campaign.\n\n\"I have had regular conversations with the president, and he has been here chatting with the players. Our relationship is normal, fluid, friendly. I know what football is like, what Madrid is like, and also know the solutions.\n\n\"We are through in the Champions League, two points behind the Liga leaders with a game more played. When this situation happens, you must focus on your work, to win the next game.\"\n\nReal Sociedad have lost their last five visits to the Bernabeu, conceding at least four goals on each occasion.\n\nHere's our 19-man squad for tomorrow's match against Real Sociedad. \ufffd\ufffd\u26bd #RMLiga #HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/HCHlOUr23w - Real Madrid C.F.

That is positive as competition between players benefits the group.\n\n\"If you want to do something in the league, you must have stability and not be anxious.

Before, it took place a few weeks earlier in the year. The change has one advantage, and one disadvantage.\n\nThe pro is that the identity of all the 38 competing teams has been revealed. Previously, with the club seasons still in progress, there was an element of guesswork involved. It is hard to work up much enthusiasm for a clash between Colombia 2 and Argentina 2 -- but when, for example, is it Deportivo Cali versus Boca Juniors, the sense of anticipation is already building.\n\nBut the downside is that the draw comes hard on the heels of the Club World Cup, which these days is hardly an advert for the strength of the Copa Libertadores. This year, once again, the limitations of the continent's champions were cruelly exposed, with Argentina's River Plate sneaking a barely deserved win against Sanfrecce Hiroshima of Japan in the semifinal before being thoroughly outclassed by Barcelona in Sunday's decider.\n\nWith the best South Americans playing abroad, the lack of outstanding individual talent in the Libertadores was, in a backhanded way, acknowledged in the draw ceremony. A prize was given to Joffre Guerron, chosen as the best player of this year's version.\n\nGuerron is an interesting player, a right-sided attacker full of explosive power, who previously won the award in 2008 when he starred with that year's champions, LDU of Quito in his native Ecuador. Now he plays for Tigres of Mexico, the beaten finalists in 2015.\n\nBut he hardly featured when his team went down to River Plate, only coming off the bench for the last 15 minutes of the second leg. In the middle of the year Tigres re-enforced their line-up, bringing in attackers such as French centre forward Andre-Pierre Gignac.\n\nGuerron lost his place in the team. The man considered the outstanding player in the tournament was not even seen as good enough for his own team in the tournament's closing stages. But Guerron was chosen because no more convincing case could be made for anyone else. Carlos Sanchez of River Plate can feel hard done by, but versatile and dynamic as he is, he will never be a contender to be included in a world XI.\n\nMore than a month before a ball is kicked, the 2016 Libertadores is already losing players who were set to be its leading lights. Playmaker Jadson, superb in the championship winning season of Corinthians in Brazil is bound for China. Miller Bolanos, after another splendid year with Ecuadorian champions Emelec, is on his way out. More will follow in the January transfer window.\n\nJoffre Guerron was voted the best player of the 2015 Copa Libertadores, despite becoming increasingly unused by his club, Tigres.\n\nAtletico Nacional of Colombia look like interesting challengers, conceding just 11 goals in their 26 matches winning their domestic championship. But will they be able to achieve the same defensive solidity without centre-back Oscar Murillo? He is not a flashy player, but his pace is vital to the team's defensive organisation. Now heading to Mexico, he will not be easy to replace.\n\nThis constant drain of talent inevitably takes its toll on the Libertadores. To flip it round, though, the sale of one player is the opportunity of another. It will be fascinating to see the latest crop of South American youngsters in action -- Atletico Nacional's Marlos Moreno, for example, looks like a magnificent prospect as a young, powerful and talented striker. He played a key role in his team's league win, and the next stage is to see if he can take that form into the international arena.\n\nThere is also, of course, the formidable tradition of the clubs involved. Group 6 looks especially fascinating. It contains three former champions (San Lorenzo of Argentina, Gremio of Brazil, LDU of Ecuador) and a strong Mexican side, Toluca. With names like that, there is always the hope that the Copa Libertadores can supply a spectacle worthy of the history of South American football.\n\nTim is an English journalist who has been based in Brazil for over 20 years.

Caretaker manager Alan Curtis has shored up a leaky defence, restored goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianksi to last season's form and breathed life into an apathetic squad by using plenty of tactical change and rotation.\n\nCurtis made eight changes to the side which fought for Swansea's first win since August against West Brom on Boxing Day. It was a brave move from a man who has shown considerable nous since taking charge of the club. The changes allowed players previously resigned to limbo such as Marvin Emnes and Jordi Amat to show their value, and kept key player Andre Ayew fresh for Saturday's clash with Manchester United.\n\nThe moves paid off, a 0-0 draw a reasonable result away to a good Palace side, with several Swans players no doubt feeling better for finally having some faith shown in them. What's more, Curtis's rotation has allowed the Swans brass a chance to evaluate the full squad ahead of the January window. The club legend continues to do a difficult job well, and is affording the board the unexpected luxury of time in making their next appointment.\n\nCrystal Palace Crystal Palace Swansea City Swansea City 0 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10=best; players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating):\n\nGK Lukasz Fabianski, 9 -- The Polish stopper was back to his best. He only had a couple of difficult saves to make, but he was dominant in the air, claiming or punching nearly everything Palace could launch into the box.\n\nDF Kyle Naughton, 8 -- The right-back's best game in a Swans shirt. Showed authority guarding his flank and won the majority of battles.\n\nDF Jordi Amat, 7 -- A first league appearance for Amat since last April, so some rust was expected. After settling in, the ball-playing centre-back showed aggression and great footwork.\n\nDF Ash Williams, 10 -- Formidable performance from the Swans captain, who was in the right place at the right time seemingly all the time. There weren't any goals to celebrate, but Williams' one-man highlight reel of crucial blocks and clearances was equally as entertaining.\n\nTime and again on Monday against Palace, Ashley Williams was there to make a critical play in defence for Swansea.\n\nDF Neil Taylor, 7 -- Taylor battled hard with Wilfried Zaha almost all game long, and did enough to help keep the clean sheet. Did pick up another booking however.\n\nMF Jack Cork, 7 -- More solid play from the quiet and industrious Cork, who showed some surprising bite in his battles with Yohan Cabaye.\n\nMF Jonjo Shelvey, 5 -- If this was an audition for a rumoured move to Palace, Shelvey blew it. Atrocious dead ball delivery, careless turnovers and slack passing all game long, and for once not even the trademark intensity was present. Played like a man with one foot out the door.\n\nMF Matt Grimes, 6 -- Looked a little out of his depth. Far too cautious in possession due to nerves and a lack of support playing on the left when most of the Swans' play flows down the right. Badly needs regular football to give him the confidence to play his game at a higher level. Should go out on loan in January.\n\nFW Marvin Emnes, 7 -- Surprisingly composed performance from a man who has barely featured this season. Showed good ball skills in possession and actually looks like he could have a role to play at the club as a legitimate rotation option.\n\nFW Modou Barrow, 7 -- Another youngster trying to step up to the plate, and is rewarding Curtis' faith with tangible progress. Got a great shot away, won a few free kicks, has bags of skill and pace, and will learn to add toughness.\n\nFW Bafetimbi Gomis, 6 -- Again lacked the polish to play the link-up game. Showed some good effort here and there to come deep and get involved, and won the free kick which almost gave Gylfi Sigurdsson a goal, but it's not enough product from a number one striker.\n\nSubstitutes:\n\nMF Ki Sung-Yeung, 7 -- Came on for Shelvey in the 56th minute to steady the ship and did just that. Has been looking better after having been given more license to get forward, and is the only Swans midfielder willing to charge up the field with the ball at his feet.\n\nMF Gylfi Sigurdsson, 8 -- Introduced at the 56th minute for Emnes but still managed two of the Swans' three shots on target, including an excellent late free kick which required a great save from Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.\n\nDF Kyle Bartley, NR -- Replaced the tiring Amat in the 77th minute, and was his usual exuberant self but disappointed with some poor passing.\n\nMax is ESPN FC's Swansea correspondent. Follow him on Twitter: @maxwellhicks", "Barcelona ready to celebrate Lionel Messi 500th appearance": "Lionel Messi will play his 500th game for Barcelona when Luis Enrique's men welcome Real Betis to the Nou Camp.\n\nLionel Messi is the most influential player in over 116 years of Blaugrana history. Having swapped the streets of Rosario for the world-famous La Masia youth academy at only 13 years of age helped him not only learn the basics of the game, but also fulfil his undeniable potential and become a world-class star.\n\nAgainst Betis on Wednesday, Messi will make his 500th appearance for Barcelona, an impressive feat that only five Barca players have reached in the past. His jaw-dropping talent, ability to unbalance games, and determination to play every single minute of football have helped him secure a place alongside legends such as Xavi Hernandez, Carles Puyol, Migueli or current teammate Andres Iniesta -- and deservedly so.\n\nWhile football titles are obviously won thanks to the collective effort of the team, nobody can deny that Barca's recent success is directly linked to Messi's omnipresent influence. Thanks to his continued hunger, impeccable professionalism and privileged skills, the diminutive No. 10 has taken the club into heights that not even the most optimistic Cules could have ever predicted.\n\nWith 424 goals to his name, the Argentinean is comfortably the club's all-time top scorer and, given his age and current form, his already splendid record can only become even more unreachable with time. Having scored more than once in 120 matches, including 27 hat tricks, four \"pokers\" and even a five-goal game, it is hardly surprising that the No. 10 is heavily tipped to win an unprecedented fifth Ballon d'Or at next month's FIFA World Player Gala.\n\nIf Barcelona have added 26 trophies to the Camp Nou museum since Messi's professional debut back in 2004, it is certainly not as a result of coincidence.\n\nMost encouragingly, the 28-year-old still has plenty of football left in his boots and no intention to leave the Camp Nou despite the constant approaches of the richest clubs in world football. Although Cules are certainly dreading the inevitable moment in which their beloved No. 10 calls it a day, it is reassuring to know their star forward is determined to continue extending his legend wearing the Blaugrana in years to come.\n\nAs it could not be any different, the Camp Nou faithful will give their Argentinean idol a warm welcome to remember before he makes his 500th appearance on Wednesday. Given that the clash against Betis will also be Barca's first home game after being crowned World Champions, the club is expected to pull out all the stops to celebrate their heroes' achievements by presenting all five trophies won in 2015 to their adoring crowd before the ball starts rolling.\n\nHaving only lost once in their previous seven outings, however, the visitors are likely to spoil the Catalans' celebrations if they aren't full focused on the job in hand. While they have occupied La Liga's bottom half of the table for the vast majority of the season, Pepe Mel's men have enough creativity up front to hurt Barca on the counter by making the most of any spaces left behind their full-backs whenever they push forward.\n\nLeo Messi has helped Barcelona win 26 trophies since making his professional debut in 2004.\n\nUndoubtedly, Barca are likely to be suffering from fatigue after travelling across the planet in the last fortnight. Due to his squad's lack of depth, Luis Enrique is expected to trust his best XI once again despite being fully aware that their legs are already feeling the effect of an insanely busy calendar.\n\nReinforcements can simply not come quickly enough. The expiration of FIFA's 14-month transfer ban on Jan. 1 means that Arda Turan and Aleix Vidal will be available for selection for Barca's first game of 2016, away at city rivals Espanyol. However, the strain on the fitness of current players has been so severe that Luis Enrique has publicly explained that the arrival of the two above-mentioned internationals may not actually be enough to strengthen his squad appropriately.\n\nIn what was certainly an uncharacteristic move, the Asturian went on to praise the progress of 21-year-old Denis Suarez, currently excelling at Villarreal, in his pre-match news conference on Tuesday. Although the manager fell short of forcefully demanding the transfer, the board should definitely get the hint and activate the buy-back clause they have on the former Blaugrana playmaker as a matter of urgency.\n\nWith up to nine matches coming in January, nobody can blame Luis Enrique for pulling all the strings in order to give his team the best possible chance of success. While repeating the treble is definitely not an obligation, the Asturian is fully aware that the bar he set so highly in his first season at the Camp Nou cannot possibly be reached otherwise.\n\nAlthough the team is in obvious need of fresh legs, the mere strength of Barcelona's front-line should be enough to make them hot favourites to win their upcoming game against Betis. If there is usually very little rivals can possibly do to stop the Messi, Luis Suarez, Neymar trident when they are inspired, the motivation to end their astonishing year with a bang should make them even more dangerous on Wednesday.\n\nFrancesc Tomas is a freelance Catalan columnist who writes for Barcablog.com, Weloba and ESPN FC.

Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating)\n\nGK Joe Hart, 7 -- Nothing too taxing to deal with until a late free kick routine ended with Christian Fuchs powering in a well -truck shot, which Hart dealt with admirably. Remarkably quiet considering the much vaunted home attacking threat, but was always secure.\n\nDF Bacary Sagna, 7 -- Had a quiet opening spell as City attacked mainly down Aleksandar Kolarov's side, but provided excellent link-up with Sterling when he swapped wings. Was tested later on, with Marc Albrighton keeping him busy and Jamie Vardy extracting a yellow card tackle on 89 minutes.\n\nDF Eliaquim Mangala, 8 -- Much tidier showing from the big man. Assured and accomplished in keeping Vardy at bay for most of the game and showed signs of developing an understanding with partner Otamendi. Horrendous foul on Leonardo Ulloa in a very dangerous area right at the end blotted his copybook slightly.\n\nDF Nicolas Otamendi, 7 -- Solid and clinical at the back and occasionally involved for attacking set pieces. Great downward header tipped away by Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, but spoiled his performance slightly by putting Mangala in trouble with a clearance then dropping like a stone when Robert Huth's arm brushed his face at a free kick.\n\nDF Aleksandar Kolarov, 7 -- Third member of the back four to receive a yellow card, for blocking Mahrez as he tried a late breakaway through the right channel. For the second game running, his crossing appeared hampered.\n\nMF Yaya Toure, 8 -- Worked hard again in a congested midfield, drawing plenty of free kicks and turning tight circles to escape his markers' attention. Deployed deep in the first half, seldom getting beyond even the full-backs, but moved forward in the second period when the chance arose.\n\nMF Fernandinho, 8 -- Attritional battle with Gokhan Inler and N'golo Kante was a thing of beauty. Always available to do the dirty work, tackling ferociously to keep Leicester's sprightly midfield at bay. One untypically crass error in the first half let in Vardy, but Fernandinho was otherwise energetic and reliable.\n\nMF David Silva, 7 -- Signs of the Silva of old were in short number here, as his second game in three days blunted his appetite after a long lay-off. Had one short spell at the start of the second half where he took the game by the scruff of the neck, but it soon petered out. Replaced on 73 minutes by Jesus Navas.\n\nMF Kevin De Bruyne, 7 -- Lively start down the left, with an early shot saved on 17 minutes by Schmeichel, but faded slightly in the second period, apart from one trademark flick through to Sterling.\n\nMF Raheem Sterling, 9 -- Confident and consistently lively performance from a player who sometimes fades in and out of games like this. Two excellent first half efforts drew accomplished saves from Schmeichel and he was still running eagerly, despite having less second half opportunity to shine, when replaced by Kelechi Iheanacho on 88 minutes.\n\nRaheem Sterling was an endless source of energy for Manchester City's attack.\n\nFW Sergio Aguero, 6 -- Might have been wiser to use the little striker as a substitute, given his fitness levels. Not much of a chance against the giant Huth and excellent Wes Morgan, bar one darting movement to meet De Bruyne's near post cross, which went high and wide off his instep.\n\nSubstitutes:\n\nFW Wilfried Bony, 5 -- On for Aguero after 63 minutes and failed to find a teammate with any of his flicks, nod-downs or passes. Managed just one shot, a hurried swipe that took the ball to its customary spot six rows back in the crowd, after a precise pass in from Kolarov.\n\nMF Jesus Navas, NR -- Brought on for Silva after 73 minutes and offered a speedy and thoughtful 17 minute cameo.\n\nFW Kelechi Iheanacho, NR -- Arrived in the 88th minute as a replacement for Sterling and managed more controlled touches than his fellow forward substitute had in a half hour.\n\nSimon writes for Down the Kippax Steps and the Manchester City programme. Follow him on Twitter @bifana_bifana.", "Leicester City duo Riyad Mahrez and NGolo Kante rise to top": "The ESPN FC crew discuss debate what Leicester being atop the EPL means for the league, UCL final prospects, and more.\n\nFive years ago, N'Golo Kante was playing for Suresnes, a small club in the suburbs of Paris, in PH, France's eighth division. The furthest he would go for a game on a Sunday afternoon would be a few miles east but still in the Paris area.\n\nA year earlier, Riyad Mahrez, he, too, a pure Parisian boy and also born in 1991, was at Sarcelles in DHR, France's seventh division, a tier above than Kante.\n\nOn Monday night, Kante and Mahrez brought Chelsea to their knees with two incredible performances that would have made people in Surensnes and Sarcelles smile a lot. The two Parisians are ruling the Premier League with Leicester, top of the table after 16 games.\n\nIt's a proper fairytale story. Kante was born in Paris' 10th arrondissement, just by the Gare du Nord where the Eurostar departs for England. His parents are from Mali and he was one of nine siblings. Football was always everything to him. When he joined Suresnes, he was fast-tracked through all the youth teams up to the senior team where he played at 19.\n\nMahrez was born in Sarcelles, a deprived city just a few miles north of Paris. His father arrived from Algeria and his mum from Morocco a few years earlier. Again part of a big family, football was also at the centre of everything. He made his debut for the Sarcelles first team at 18.\n\nThey are very different characters. Kante is the quiet one, hardly talks and is very religious. Mahrez is the louder one. Kante is the hardworking midfielder who never stops running, a machine of a player despite his small size. There is nothing that scares him. Mahrez is the magician, with a \"hand in place of his left foot\", as is said France. There is nothing he can't do with a football.\n\nThey also have a lot of similarities. The Paris link is obviously huge. They talked the same way, understand things the same way, grew up the same way. Both come from a council estate and are street footballers. They used to play for hours down their blocks with their mates from the neighbourhood. They developed their talent by playing against bigger kids, in all conditions, in small spaces. Kante has always compensated for his lack of technical ability by more work and more running. Mahrez was skinny growing up so he added in skills to what he lacked in physical strength. They always faced adversity. Kante was apparently too small (5-ft, 5-in) to make it while Mahrez was too lightweight and \"only\" technical.\n\nBut they never gave up. It's interesting to note as well that they never went through an academy, unlike most of the professional players. PSG, for example, showed interest, especially in Mahrez but nothing ever happened. Like Franck Ribery, Mathieu Valbuena, Laurent Koscielny or Leicester's own Jamie Vardy, they had to do it the hard way. Kante went to Boulogne, in the north of France to play first with their reserves in CFA2, France's fifth division, then with their first team in National, France's third tier before finally moving to Caen, in Ligue 2 and later in Ligue 1.\n\nMahrez left Sarcelles for Quimper, in the west of the country to play in CFA, France's fourth division before joining the Le Havre reserves also in CFA and then finally making it in Ligue 2 with the club's first team.\n\nOn Sept. 27th, 2013, they faced each other in Ligue 2. Caen won 1-0 thanks to a late goal on penalty. That evening, Leicester had a scout in the stands at the Stade Michel d'Ornano. Mahrez arrived in January 2014 and Kante followed last summer. And what a pair of great coups they have been for Leicester.\n\nJamie Vardy may get most of the headlines, but it is the midfield duo of Riyad Mahrez and N'Golo Kante that has powered Leicester City to the top of the table.\n\nAt 24, they are both a key part of the Foxes' success. Kante is the engine of the midfield. As manager Claudio Ranieri said after Monday's win against Chelsea: \"He is amazing. He recovers all the balls, in this stadium, the other stadiums, everywhere!\"\n\nMahrez is already a big contender for player of the season. In 15 Premier League matches, he scored 11 goals, one against Chelsea, and gave seven assists, including one against Chelsea. He has been unstoppable all season, except against Arsenal, the only defeat suffered by the Foxes this season.\n\nAnd in Ranieri, another former French football employee who he spent two good seasons at Monaco (2012-2014), Mahrez and Kante have found the perfect manager. The Italian has given Mahrez all the freedom he needs to express himself. And tactically, he has already taught Kante a lot. His approach, like the 4-4-2 formation he played against Chelsea for example, suits the two players very well. He knew them from his time in France. He faced Mahrez in Ligue 2 in his first season at Monaco, from which he also followed Kante's progress.\n\nLeicester's rise to the top of the Premier League has been astounding, and it is even more incredible to think that the base of that success in Mahrez and Kante, all started in the French lower leagues.\n\nJulian Laurens is a London-based French journalist who writes for ESPN FC and Le Parisien. Follow him on Twitter @LaurensJulien.", "Arsenal can spring surprise against Barcelona in UCL": "Arsenal's general secretary David Miles says their tie with Barcelona is the pick of the round of 16 in the UCL.\n\nHaving come through their Champions League qualifying group in the most complicated, difficult way possible, Arsenal's reward was to draw tournament favourites Barcelona in the round of 16. It was a group they were always unlikely to win anyway, with Bayern Munich obviously the strongest side in it, so how they got to this point was irrelevant.\n\nNor do Arsenal fans need any reminding that drawing one of the so-called easy sides is any guarantee of European progression. Last season Monaco looked like a great chance for Arsene Wenger's men to go further than the round of 16 for the first time since the 2009-10 season, when they made the quarterfinals.\n\nIt didn't pan out as planned, resulting in an exit at a familiar stage, and when you look at what lies in front of them this season, it's hard to see them making much progress. Barcelona are the best team in Europe and in Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi, they have the most ludicrously talented and potent strike force in living memory.\n\nMessi and Arsenal have some history. Witness his four-goal haul at the Camp Nou in 2010 when he reacted to Nicklas Bendtner putting the visitors ahead in the 18th minute. Messi single-handedly dismantled the Arsenal defence; it was as if he took umbrage to the opening goal, punishing the cheek of it all with a master class of a performance.\n\nIn 2011, after Arsenal had won the first leg 2-1 with an Andrei Arshavin goal that resulted in the bizarre, but rather endearing, sight of the Russian lifting his jersey to display a T-shirt with a picture of himself on it, Messi scored twice at home in the second leg to help Barcelona through 3-1 on the night and 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nHistory will only show they qualified, but it was a lucky night for that season's eventual winners. After Robin van Persie had been harshly sent off for a second yellow card picked up on 56 minutes when referee Massimo Busacca thought the Dutchman had kicked the ball away in dissent, there was a chance late in the game for Bendtner to make himself an Arsenal hero. Clean through on goal, in the final few minutes, his first touch from a Jack Wilshere pass was poor and allowed Barcelona to clear.\n\nHad Bendtner finished, Arsenal would have gone through on away goals and this was an Arsenal squad that contained players like Johan Djourou, Mikel Silvestre, Sebastian Squillaci, Denilson and Marouane Chamakh.\n\nThat match proved football isn't predictable. It's hard not to think that moment would have completely altered Bendtner's career trajectory too. Maybe he could have built on being the man who knocked out Barcelona rather than the one who clumsily missed that chance. Maybe that would have sparked life into an Arsenal side that has suffered repeatedly from confidence issues.\n\nESPN FC's Janusz Michallik says Barcelona will have to much for Arsenal in the round of 16.\n\nIt's all water under the bridge now, of course, and the task that lies ahead for Wenger's team this season is unquestionably very difficult. If Barcelona were dominant back in the early part of the decade, it feels as if they're even more dangerous these days. That attacking trio has close to 50 goals between them already this season and you wouldn't bet against them adding to that tally when the teams meet.\n\nWhen you see how they utterly destroyed Real Madrid 4-0 a few weeks ago, casually throwing on Messi as a substitute to further torment Rafael Benitez and his players, it's hard not to fear the worst from an Arsenal point of view.\n\nYet if Barcelona are better, so too are Wenger's men. There's genuine world class talent in the side with Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez and you can be sure the Chilean will want to make his mark against his old side.\n\nThere's also January to consider. We don't need to go into Arsenal's injury situation in any depth, but if Wenger doesn't spend money when the window opens again, it would be a massive surprise. We could see a stronger Arsenal by the time the teams meet in the New Year.\n\nOf course it's a massive, unenviable job to try and get the better of a team as good as Barcelona over two legs, but that is what being in the Champions League is all about -- pitting yourself against the best. That's exactly who Arsenal will face in February and March next year.\n\nAndrew Mangan is owner and writer of the award-winning arseblog.com.

While Leicester have enjoyed an incredible campaign, plenty of other sides have work left to do in order to meet their objectives this season.\n\nESPN FC's club bloggers rate their campaigns so far and predict what lies in store in 2016.\n\nArsenal\n\nRating so far: 8/10\n\nAt a glance: Arsenal have little to complain about. Despite a swathe of injuries, they have been pretty consistent so far. The high point has to be the 3-0 trouncing of Manchester United at the Emirates in October. The Champions League campaign started disastrously, but the team recovered well to qualify for the knockout stage and book yet another showdown with Barcelona.\n\nStar man: Mesut Ozil. Quite simply, the best midfielder in this season's Premier League.\n\nMust do better: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Injuries have presented him with a fantastic chance to stake a claim for a regular place, but he has failed to capitalise.\n\nJames McNicholas: It looks like it might shape up to be a straight fight between Arsenal and Manchester City for the title. The difference between first and second may well come down to two things: Sergio Aguero's fitness and Arsene Wenger's willingness to enter the transfer market in January. A 2-1 win over Manuel Pellegrini's men has given Arsenal fresh impetus as they hunt their first league title in over 10 years.\n\nAston Villa\n\nRating so far: 3/10\n\nAt a glance: It's been a disastrous season for Villa and the club are not only on course for relegation, but for bottom place in the league and possibly the ultimate shame of being the worst team ever in Premier League history. Remi Garde has a massive task on his hands.\n\nStar man: Micah Richards. The powerful defender has shown passion and desire, as demonstrated by his celebration after his headed goal against Watford in November.\n\nMust do better: Jack Grealish. He has talent to burn but has contributed next to nothing this season and is no longer considered a regular starter.\n\nKevin Hughes: Villa are sliding out of the league fast and the next few weeks will be a defining period followed by what is probably the most important transfer window of owner Randy Lerner's reign. Two or three top class signings might just save Villa, but there's a gloomy acceptance this team is already down. It would take a remarkable recovery to avoid relegation in 2016.\n\nBournemouth\n\nRating so far: 8/10\n\nAt a glance: Bournemouth started well and looked on course to stay up but a terrible wave of injuries looked to have made relegation likely. However, Eddie Howe has always been confident the players he has could bring him the results needed to stay up and the back-to-back victories over Chelsea and Manchester United have proved that. Players that were peripheral in the Championship in 2014-15 have come into the starting XI, notably Junior Stanislas, but also Josh King and Adam Smith, and seized their opportunity with zeal.\n\nStar man: Matt Ritchie. No wonder Paolo Di Canio resigned after Swindon sold him to Bournemouth; no-one would want to lose such a consistently dangerous and productive player.\n\nMust do better: The strikers. It's difficult to be critical of anyone but since the injury to main striker Callum Wilson, whoever has played up front has not scored enough despite their endeavour.\n\nSteve Menary: Bournemouth have shown they can beat anyone in the Premier League and 16th still looks achievable.\n\nEddie Howe masterminded wins over Chelsea and Manchester United to give Bournemouth hope they can survive.\n\nChelsea\n\nRating so far: 1/10\n\nAt a glance: The reigning Premier League champions have embarked on the worst title defence in living memory. There has been the odd ray of light, such as the 2-0 win over London rivals Arsenal and the professional display during the Champions League victory over Porto by the same scoreline that ensured progression as group winners, but they have been few and far between. It has been an extraordinary fall from grace, that resulted in Jose Mourinho's departure as manager.\n\nStar man: Willian. The Brazilian has been the one bright spot in an otherwise dispiriting campaign, with his industry and supreme ability at set pieces rescuing his teammates on several occasions.\n\nMust do better: Cesc Fabregas. To be fair to the Spaniard, there are several others that must also drastically improve, though the central midfielder's loss of form has arguably been the most impactful, especially given his inability to contribute defensively. Booed before Chelsea's 3-1 win over Sunderland, his standing among some fans is very low.\n\nPhil Lythell: Climbing into the top four still looked possible until the recent 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth and 2-1 loss at Leicester set the team back once again. It is not totally beyond them, though it would require the type of run that no team in the league has managed in this topsy-turvy season. A top six finish in the Premier League looks like a more realistic ambition at present.\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nRating so far: 8/10\n\nAt a glance: Plenty of pundits and fans hinted Palace might flirt with the European places this season but few would have thought they'd still be there at Christmas. The only worry is the slightly disappointing home form but this is probably the Eagles' best ever squad and it could be their best ever season.\n\nStar man: Yohan Cabaye. He is starting to make that \u00a310 million pricetag look like a bargain with lots of goals and brilliant defensive displays to boot. Plus he has lovely hair.\n\nMust do better: Dwight Gayle. No league goals yet and he failed to make that target man role his own during Connor Wickham's injury.\n\nJim Daly: A European place is genuinely on offer for Palace, but ideally they'd achieve that next season when the squad will hopefully be even stronger in depth. A top 10 spot should now be the least they expect .\n\nEverton\n\nRating so far: 5/10\n\nAt a glance: Everton are back playing exciting football, the only problem is matching it with results. There have been times when the desired consistency has surfaced, namely the 3-0 win at Southampton in August, but most other matches see a team unable to cross the winning line.\n\nStar man: Romelu Lukaku's goal scoring makes him the obvious candidate, but Gareth Barry gets the nod for his all-round consistency. He has been excellent this season and is the player who makes Everton tick.\n\nMust do better: Is it cheating to say the entire team? Tim Howard continues to operate on borrowed time in the eyes of many, although seemingly not in those of manager Roberto Martinez.\n\nLuke O'Farrell: The upcoming League Cup semifinal against Manchester City represents the most realistic path to silverware, unless there is a similarly strong showing in the FA Cup. Final league placing depends on which Everton turns up and how Martinez handles the ongoing defensive issues. Current evident suggests a team likely to challenge but ultimately fall short of European football.\n\nLeicester\n\nRating so far: 10/10\n\nAt a glance: The season has started beyond Leicester's wildest dreams. They could even be shock contenders for the Premier League title -- a feat that would rival Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest in 1977-78. There have been a number of highs, including 3-2 comeback victories over Aston Villa and West Brom and 3-0 away wins at Newcastle and Swansea. Even the one low, a 5-2 hammering by Arsenal, was end-to-end and tremendous entertainment. City are already safe and now in with a realistic shout of Europe.\n\nStar man: Jamie Vardy. The Premier League's top scorer netted in 11-straight games, breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy's record. At this rate he could plausibly lead England's line at Euro 2016. Close behind is Riyad Mahrez who has 13 goals and seven assists from 16 games.\n\nMust do better: Leonardo Ulloa. The Argentine was top scorer last season, but has managed just one goal in 11 appearances thus far and been guilty of squandering big chances against both Swansea (3-0) and Manchester United (1-1).\n\nBen Jacobs: Leicester are almost certain to finish in the top half of the table and if they can navigate a tricky run of festive fixtures, a top four finish isn't out of the question. A lot will depend on whether the club can hold on to Vardy and Mahrez this January, but neither look likely to leave. If anything, the club have the money and ambition to strengthen when the window opens. Given where Leicester currently stand, it will be disappointing if they don't at least qualify for the Europa League, which is incredible considering 12 months ago the club were rock-bottom of the Premier League.\n\nLeicester's incredible rise to unlikely title challengers is one of the stories of the season so far.\n\nLiverpool\n\nRating so far: 6/10\n\nAt a glance: Liverpool are still hanging in there, with obvious high points in the two big away wins under Jurgen Klopp against Chelsea and Manchester City. The struggles at Anfield are becoming a real concern, though. Change in management midseason automatically lowers expectations but there are limits.\n\nStar man: Nathaniel Clyne. Becoming a byword for consistency while bigger stars are too erratic.\n\nMust do better: Simon Mignolet. Too inconsistent and too poor dealing with balls into the box and set pieces.\n\nSteven Kelly: All realistic targets at the beginning of the season are miraculously alive. Like last season, a chance of a top-four spot should be kept going until March. Cups will depend on favourable draws as always, with one semifinal already reached in the Capital One Cup, but Liverpool currently seem less daunted by the biggest challenges than by games they ought to win easily.\n\nManchester City\n\nRating so far: 7/10\n\nAt a glance: It's been a season of ups and downs. After starting so well with five straight wins and looking like they were going to walk the league at a canter, City have looked timid and beatable ever since. Champions League progress has been a big plus and Dynamo Kiev in the Round of 16 represents a good chance to get to the last eight.\n\nStar man: Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian has revolutionised City's attack and has barely put a foot wrong since he arrived, stacking up goals and assists in nearly every match.\n\nMust do better: Eliaquim Mangala has been with the club for almost 18 months and there are still few signs of him being able to settle in to the first-team without Vincent Kompany.\n\nDavid Mooney: The rest of the season hangs finely in the balance. City could get their act together throughout 2016, start putting in consistently good performances and win games comfortably to take the Premier League title. Or they could fall apart in a similar manner to 2014-15 and leave many questioning Manuel Pellegrini's position. The latter looks more likely.\n\nManchester United\n\nRating so far: 6/10\n\nAt a glance: United's results have not been good enough and, given their transfer outlay, more should be expected. There has been little of the attacking fluency that marks this team at its best. The low point was the exit from the Champions League at the group stage, which showed that United are far from being a major force at such a level.\n\nStar man: Chris Smalling. Remarkably, he has quietly emerged as the team's most consistent defender, and is one of the very best centre-backs in the Premier League.\n\nMust do better: Wayne Rooney. The club's highest-paid player and star forward has looked short of pace and confidence for most of the season, and it must be hoped that this is not the sign of an alarming decline.\n\nMusa Okwonga: The team is resilient enough to finish in the top four, but does not have the attacking firepower to finish at the summit. The chasing pack behind Arsenal and Manchester City will push United close, and one of those teams will probably be rewarded for their more expansive football with a higher league position. Finishing third and no silverware looks likely.\n\nLouis van Gaal is under pressure following mixed results and perceived dull football at Manchester United.\n\nNewcastle United\n\nRating so far: 6/10\n\nAt a glance: It's been a case of slow progress for Newcastle United in recent months, but there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel for Steve McClaren. The Magpies have failed to shine in some of the so-called lesser games but the back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Tottenham show they can do it when they apply themselves. A relegation battle is still the theme but at least there's some hope going into the New Year.\n\nStar man: Georginio Wijnaldum. He's been the standout performer so far and netted four goals in the 6-2 win over Norwich.\n\nMust do better: Florian Thauvin must be regarded as a big disappointment after \u00a313m move from Marseille.\n\nLee Ryder: Newcastle must convince their fans they are capable of staying up with time to spare. Talk of the top eight has been shelved and while an FA Cup run is wanted, it is all about survival now for McClaren. There'll be no sleep until the Magpies reach the 40 point mark.\n\nNorwich\n\nRating so far: 6/10\n\nAt a glance: Early promise has given way to an arduous slog that has now turned into a fully fledged relegation scrap. Norwich City's inconsistency and penchant for individual errors has emerged as the two dominant themes. Alex Neil's men continue to be masters of their own downfall.\n\nStar man: Robbie Brady. City's \u00a37m summer signing looks a bargain. Deployed at left-back, right-back and left midfield already this season, his set piece deliveries are proving a major weapon.\n\nMust do better: John Ruddy. Started the season as Norwich City's undisputed No. 1, but high-profile gaffes cost points at West Ham, Manchester City and at home to Arsenal -- and eventually his place in the side. Declan Rudd's form will dictate how long he is kept on the periphery.\n\nPaddy Davitt: Norwich's top brass have made it clear the upcoming January window will be crucial to their survival prospects. Buy well, and the Canaries will feel their collective resolve and fighting spirit under the inspirational Neil will help them achieve their objective of staying up. Given they are out of the Capital One Cup and have drawn Manchester City in the FA Cup, you can forget about adding trophies to the cabinet. Survival will be just as sweet.\n\nSouthampton\n\nRating so far: 5/10\n\nAt a glance: The season got off to a bad start when Southampton were dumped out of the Europa League before the group stage by Danish minnows Midtjylland. A poor November highlighted a lack of squad depth in the wake of more big-name summer departures the previous summer and also affected confidence in the team.\n\nStar man: Graziano Pelle. When the Italian plays well, Southampton play well. When he is not firing, they struggle.\n\nMust do better: Jordy Clasie. The lightweight Netherlands international is yet to offer a convincing argument he has the quality to fill the substantial void left by Morgan Schneiderlin.\n\nAlex Crook: Southampton's aim at the start of the season was to replicate last season's European finish, but that will be difficult without significant investment during the January transfer window. Ronald Koeman is too reliant on Pelle, so a striker should be top of his shopping list. Winning the FA Cup may be Southampton's best chance of reaching the Europa League but they will need a bit of luck in the draw after being thrashed 6-1 by Liverpool in the Capital One Cup.\n\nStoke\n\nRating so far: 7/10\n\nAt a glance: The Potters failed to a win any of their first six games but Mark Hughes' men have picked up form and remain on course to match or better last season's finish of ninth.\n\nStar man: Glen Johnson. Arrived on a free and was almost universally written off by fans up and down the land, only to show everyone that he still has plenty to offer.\n\nMust do better: Marco van Ginkel. The loanee from Chelsea has struggled to make a positive impact.\n\nJames Whittaker: There's no reason to suggest that Stoke will finish any lower than last season given their progress at the halfway point and the fact that they are yet to hit top gear. Should they manage to maintain their excellent defensive form and keep Xherdan Shaqiri firing on all cylinders, a unlikely push for a European spot is not beyond them.\n\nStoke have become stylish under Mark Hughes, with the likes of Xherdan Shaqiri pivotal to their attractive play.\n\nSunderland\n\nRating so far: 4/10\n\nAt a glance: Dick Advocaat seemed curiously out of his depth, perhaps disillusioned by summer transfer activity, and new boss Sam Allardyce's recovery has been patchy. With notable but rare exceptions, Sunderland still cannot beat ordinary sides.\n\nStar man: Yann M'Vila, only on loan from Rubin Kazan, is one of the best midfielders seen in Sunderland colours in years and Allardyce needs to sign him permanently.\n\nMust do better: Fabio Borini has so far done nothing to justify Sunderland's protracted pursuit of a player who did so well on loan.\n\nColin Randall: There will be no trophies but there may yet be another rally to save the season. Allardyce's January transfer business promises to be crucial. If, with owner Ellis Short's backing, he gets if right, Sunderland could finish as high as sixth bottom. But it is going to be tough and could end in tears.\n\nSwansea\n\nRating so far: 3/10\n\nAt a glance: A fast start flattered to deceive, and Swansea have been in a freefall since September. The club will now write off the first half of the season and look to start fresh in the New Year with a new manager after the sacking of Garry Monk.\n\nStar man: Andre Ayew. In a squad full of underperforming players, Ayew hasn't always been at his best but his quality is clear.\n\nMust do better: Bafetimbi Gomis warrants criticism not just for his own failure to score, but for the lack of good service coming from the rest of the team. Could involve himself more.\n\nMax Hicks: The squad is strong enough to survive relegation and midtable is not an unreasonable expectation, even with just half a season to get there. The new manager will be under pressure to make it happen.\n\nTottenham\n\nRating so far: 7/10\n\nAt a glance: A youthful squad has defied the critics who predicted problems after the end of the summer transfer window, with 21-year-old Eric Dier and 19-year-old Dele Alli both making an impressive impact in midfield and being rewarded with senior England debuts. Spurs have thumped Manchester City and London rivals West Ham 4-1 at White Hart Lane while triumphing 5-1 away at Bournemouth, and they managed to avoid defeat in 14 successive Premier League matches. However, that sequence hid the fact they have drawn too many games and thrown away too many leads, while their bid to repeat last season's run to the Capital One Cup final was short-lived as they suffered a 2-1 home defeat against arch-rivals Arsenal in September.\n\nStar man: Toby Alderweireld looked a key signing in the summer and so it has proved -- an absolute bargain at \u00a311.5m.\n\nMust do better: Clinton Njie has plenty of pace but has made a slow start to his Spurs career.\n\nBen Pearce: Champions League qualification is certainly a realistic goal, however Spurs have remained frustratingly just outside the top four spots despite the inconsistency of their rivals. A fifth-place finish seems likely. Meanwhile, Spurs have tricky ties in the Europa League and FA Cup, facing Fiorentina and Leicester respectively -- the very sides that knocked them out of the same competitions last year. They are certainly capable of going further this time but the Premier League is likely to be the priority so they will need their squad players to step up.\n\nMauricio Pochettino has created a young an exciting Tottenham side, but doubts remain over their top four hopes.\n\nWatford\n\nRating so far: 9/10\n\nAt a glance: Watford have already won more games than they managed in an entire season on their last visit to the Premier League in 2006-07. They haven't spent a single day in the relegation zone and already have a very healthy cushion should their form suffer a dip. It's been an incredible start. Quique Sanchez Flores has changed his trusted 4-2-3-1 formation and reunited strikers Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney in a 4-4-2. The impact of this change has been remarkable and Flores deserves credit for adapting his approach to suit the players and the league.\n\nStar man: Odion Ighalo. The Nigerian has continued his outstanding form throughout 2015, scoring 10 Premier League goals before Christmas, and has made many experienced centre-backs look foolish with his swift turns.\n\nMust do better: Jose Manuel Jurado. The Spaniard has so much experience and ability he should be a key player in midfield, but so far he has struggled to influence games. However, there have been encouraging signs in recent games that he's finding his feet.\n\nMichael Moruzzi: It seems inevitable that Watford will suffer a dip in form at some point. But they have rarely looked out of their depth and have nothing to fear from most of the other teams they will face. A mid-table finish looks achievable at this point, which no-one expected to be saying at Christmas.\n\nWest Brom\n\nRating so far: 7/10\n\nAt a glance: Steady and unspectacular season. Form away from home has been the highlight, particularly the 1-0 win over local rivals Aston Villa, avenging the two losses they suffered at Villa Park last season.\n\nStar man: Jonny Evans. The Northern Ireland international has been fantastic since joining from Manchester United, putting in a series of outstanding performances at centre-back before performing equally as well at both left-back and in holding midfield in recent weeks.\n\nMust do better: Saido Berahino. The young striker looked to have put his disappointment at not being able to join Tottenham behind him, with three goals in his first four games after the transfer window, but has since looked out of form.\n\nMatthew Evans: West Brom will be looking to continue their upturn in form and try to break into the top 10 of the Premier League for the first time in three seasons. With Championship strugglers Bristol City in the third round of the FA Cup and the disappointment of last year's quarterfinal defeat to Aston Villa still fresh in the supporters' minds, fans will be hoping that Pulis fields a strong side in that competition from the off.\n\nWest Ham\n\nRating so far: 8/10\n\nAt a glance: A new manager often galvanises a side but Slaven Bilic seems to have inspired the whole East End of London. Some of the football played this season has been excellent. If Bilic can build a cohesive defensive unit while also ensuring some of the attacking football of the opening months of the campaign is seen more regularly, supporters are in for a successful time.\n\nStar man: Dimitri Payet. An instant success and looks dangerous whenever he is on the ball. His individual skills have had the Hammers' faithful purring and thinking back to the days of Paolo Di Canio. Injury has curtailed the Payet success story recently but the future is bright when he returns.\n\nMust do better: Andy Carroll. Most fans are behind Carroll and willing him to do well, but the club needs to see the return of the type of player that joined the club on loan back in 2012.\n\nPeter Thorne: West Ham's season will probably depend, as ever, on how many injuries the squad suffer and how quickly they recover. Fans dream of a cup run and this squad is capable of that if fully fit. Most supporters are looking beyond this season and will just settle for a top half placing and the chance to build better things with the move to Stratford next season.", "Manchester United forward Anthony Partial shines vs Chelsea": "David De Gea and Thibaut Courtois were the heroes on the night, in a match that ended 0-0 thanks to their stellar goalkeeping.\n\nManchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes his side dominated the match and deserved to win against Chelsea.\n\nMan United captain Wayne Rooney insists that his side will return to fighting form eventually after a 0-0 against Chelsea.\n\nChelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink reacts to his side's goalless draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford.\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin states the obvious after United fall short of a win against Chelsea.\n\nManchester United 0, Chelsea 0. This scoreline will not tell the story of what was perhaps United's finest performance of the season, where they struck the woodwork twice -- through Juan Mata and Anthony Martial -- and were denied in the second half by the brilliance of Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.\n\nThough Chelsea played without a conventional No. 9, they were not defensive from the outset -- rather, they were pushed back on their heels time and again by the type of performance that many no longer thought Man United manager Louis van Gaal was capable of inspiring at this club.\n\nIn what many regarded as a must-win game for the Dutchman, his team fashioned enough chances to win the game, which is why the final scoreline should be so disappointing for them. For all their possession, they failed to be truly penetrative in the final third, with the lack of opportunities that they made centrally an unfortunate problem. In isolation, this was a good performance with very good moments, but as part of a trend, it may ultimately be damning.\n\nManchester United Manchester United Chelsea Chelsea 0 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nPlayer Ratings (1-10; 10=best. Players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating):\n\nGK David De Gea, 8 -- Made two superb saves, one early in the first half from John Terry, the second in the second half from his Spanish compatriot Pedro -- and his follow-up to deny Cesar Azpilicueta was very smart too. Passed the ball out well from the back and confirmed his status as one of the top handful of goalkeepers in the world.\n\nDF Matteo Darmian, 7 -- Though not fully fit on his return, he got forward well down the left flank and his fine overlapping with Martial was one of the most promising features of this performance. An encouraging return, where he showed much of his good early season form.\n\nDF Daley Blind, 7 -- After a slightly unsure start, he settled well and was positionally sound thereafter, managing to get forward well enough to produce some incisive passing into the final third. Had some of United's forwards had the same degree of guile, they may just have edged this game.\n\nDF Chris Smalling, 7 -- Distribution was a little loose in the early stages, but he was generally sound, bringing the ball out from the back with authority.\n\nDF Ashley Young, 7 -- A very fine first half, which featured a superb tackle to dispossess Azpilicueta as he advanced dangerously on the counterattack, and a somewhat quieter second -- like the rest of his team, in his defence. Industrious throughout, though could have been a little more accomplished with his final ball.\n\nMF Bastian Schweinsteiger, 6 -- Got the ball forward intelligently and promptly, though could have been sharper on possession and looked tired towards the end. His presence and playmaking are vital to this team when he is at his best. He showed enough here to suggest that he can still make a significant contribution.\n\nMF Morgan Schneiderlin, 7 -- A return to the side which begged the question as to why he had been on the bench so long. Provided a typically strong defensive presence as well as ambition when passing forward, the only blemish being a yellow card for a late first half challenge.\n\nMF Ander Herrera, 7 -- Hardworking and inventive, he combined well with his fellow midfielders and was unfortunate not to score the winner after a fine late run into the box saw him denied by Courtois' save of the match.\n\nMF Juan Mata, 6 -- Hit the crossbar after only a few minutes, and was key to much of United's early creativity. Faded in the second half, like most of his teammates, but showed why so much is expected of him.\n\nFW Anthony Martial, 8 -- Created the game's best chance with a wonderful dribble in from the left flank and centre across goal, the highlight of another performance where he was a continual threat from out wide. Had Branislav Ivanovic been in his early season form, this would have been a brutal mismatch, but it was instead a compelling contest.\n\nAnthony Martial was Manchester United's most dangerous man in attack against Chelsea.\n\nFW Wayne Rooney, 7 -- A very fine first half, where he ran at players and struck the ball from distance with the vigour of old, and where his first touch looked better than it has all season. Did not manage to maintain that intensity in the second half, and should perhaps have done better with a difficult cross from the left from substitute Cameron Borthwick-Jackson.\n\nSubstitutions:\n\nDF Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, 7 -- On for Darmian in the 70th minute. Assured from the moment he took the pitch, and almost created the winner for Rooney with an excellent cross to the far post.\n\nFW Memphis Depay, NR -- Replaced Mata in the 77th minute. Unable to make an impact in his limited time on the field. Attempted a bold flick to spread the play but was unable to complete what would have been a fine attack.\n\nDF Phil Jones, NR -- Came on for Blind in the 82nd minute and defended doggedly for the closing minutes, surviving an admittedly faint handball shout in the process.\n\nMusa Okwonga is a football author, poet, musician, broadcaster and social commentator.

He will have to wait, to watch... and he will be there for us to transmit things to him at training.\"\n\nFit again Colombia international Jackson Martinez, who has missed the last two months through injury, will be on the the bench at Rayo on Wednesday, Simeone said.\n\n\"Today he got the medical all clear,\" he said. \"He has been doing well. He will be on the bench tomorrow, with the expectation that he will get some minutes if the team needs it. He is recovering, with consistency in the training sessions.\"\n\nThe La Liga co-leaders would face a stiff task at Estadio Vallecas, Simeone said, recalling that Paco Jemez's attack-minded team were 2-1 up at Real Madrid before the winter break, even if they were eventually hammered 10-2 after having two players sent off.\n\n\"Rayo are always a very brave team,\" he said. \"Their attacking play is incisive. The first 15 minutes of the last game were impressive, they played much better than [Madrid], with numerical superiority all over the pitch. Then things changed due to the circumstances of the game.\n\nRayo are a dangerous team -- their bravery is a virtue and a defect. It is dangerous to play against a team like that.\"", "Chelsea problems go deeper than managers": "ESPN FC's Craig Burley believes Chelsea's struggles are still related to ex-manager Jose Mourinho's impact at the club.\n\nThe ESPN FC panel answer your tweets on Eden Hazard, Manchester United and more.\n\nIf the Manchester United board are agonising over whether to replace Louis van Gaal with Jose Mourinho, Monday's 0-0 draw against Chelsea should give them pause for thought. Should they limp on with the Dutchman or turn to the Portuguese? They may reflect that if Mourinho could win last season's title with the Chelsea team on show at Old Trafford, he could win it with United's mismatched squad as well.\n\nBoth clubs lack a sense of direction and purpose. Chelsea have sacked their manager and United will follow their example before long. If only the answer to their problems were so simple; the west London club need more fundamental changes than the man in the dugout.\n\nAs caretakers go, Guus Hiddink is the best man for the job by far. The 69-year-old's record shows he can mix and match players to produce teams greater than the sum of their parts. Yet he is the short-term answer. Mourinho left a mess at Stamford Bridge but the former manager inherited a squad that lacked coherence. The transfer policy that has been conducted since his first departure in 2007 has a greater emphasis on talent than effectiveness. For Chelsea to regain true heavyweight status, the next permanent manager must convince Roman Abramovich to balance his desire for star names in blue shirts with the demands of collective performance.\n\nThe Russian owner's eagerness to create a team of entertainers suddenly seems like an anachronistic policy. A decade ago, the gap in financial resources between Chelsea and most of their rivals in the Premier League created a chasm in ability and as a result, the west London club could bully most clubs on and off the pitch. The recent television deals have levelled the fiscal playing field -- an influx of more talented players have transformed the so-called \"lesser\" sides in England's top flight and artistry is less of an advantage.\n\nChelsea have too much talent now and cramming it into one team is not working. There will always be days when the likes of Eden Hazard, Oscar, Pedro and Cesc Fabregas will destroy an opponent but a lack of \"water carriers\" tends to betray a side, especially in a frantically-paced division.\n\nRoman Abramovich has spent years buying superstars but the league's catching up, requiring a different approach.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, winning the title last season is arguably Mourinho's greatest achievement. Nemanja Matic and Fabregas were the engine room of the midfield in 2014-15 but have misfired badly this season. Chelsea are routinely outmanned in the middle of the park. The Serbia midfielder is a little one-paced and one-dimensional. Opponents have worked out how to deal with him. Matic at least looks like he cares, though Fabregas has been one of the disappointments of the campaign.\n\nLike Mourinho -- who would have preferred to go to Old Trafford and not Chelsea -- there was a sense that the former Arsenal man didn't really want to go to Stamford Bridge when he left Barcelona two years ago. Now he looks like he would rather be anywhere else. He was missing against United with illness but Fabregas may give Hiddink more sleepless nights than any other member of the Chelsea squad.\n\nAgainst Watford on Boxing Day, his most recent game, the 28-year-old sat too deep in midfield, took too many touches on the ball and seemed reluctant to pass forward. He slowed the pace of Chelsea's game. The difference in momentum when Fabregas was replaced by John Obi Mikel in the second half was substantial.\n\nMost disturbing, though, was Fabregas's body language. At his best for Arsenal, Barcelona and Spain, the midfielder's movement and awareness are a pleasure to watch. He searches for space, eyes flickering as he assesses options, and there is an eagerness about his running. His demeanour was very different against Watford. When Chelsea defended a corner, he lingered upfield. Pedro, from inside his own area, called to his teammate and made an \"are you bothering to come back?\" gesture. Fabregas plodded into defence, barely acknowledging the exchange.\n\nCesc Fabregas's decline speaks to Chelsea's imbalance, for he was purchased without squad coherence in mind.\n\nThe moment was more illuminating than any statistical analysis of Fabregas's passing and running and an indication of Chelsea's deep-seated problems. Too many players are focused on their own displays rather than the team. Hiddink can paper over some of the cracks but the issues can only be resolved in the summer when a new manager arrives with a long-term plan.\n\nChelsea have spent years buying for the owner's imagination but the next manager will need to find a balance that's been lacking at the Bridge. The time of fantasy football is over.\n\nJohn Stones needs Phil Jagielka\n\nEverton are thrilling going forward but careless at the back. The natural response is to question John Stones, a young centre-back whose reputation probably outstripped his ability at the beginning of the season.\n\nIt's harsh to criticise the 21-year-old. Stones has tons of potential and is operating in a position where players get better with age and experience. He will benefit from the return of Phil Jagielka, too, who has been sidelined with a knee injury since October and whose influence is easy to underestimate. Stones will improve more quickly when the 33-year-old comes back.\n\nTony Evans has been a sports journalist for more than 20 years. He writes for ESPN FC and is former football editor of The Times. Twitter: @tonyevans92a.", "PSG dominance Marseille woe stories of Ligue 1 first half": "PSG's unstoppable form in Ligue 1 this season has them set to wrap up the title race by March.\n\nAs the Ligue 1 season reaches the winter break, Julien Laurens looks back on the highlights and lowlights so far and suggests what might happen next.\n\nThe season so far:\n\nIt has been a season like we had never seen in French football history. Never before has a team (Paris Saint-Germain) been so dominant, so unstoppable and so ruthless. They are obviously still unbeaten with a record-breaking 51 points (16 wins, 3 draws) in their opening 19 games, something that had never been achieved before.\n\nAt this stage last year, Marcelo Bielsa's Marseille were top, with Lyon second and Paris only third. This year, PSG have as many points as Lyon and Marseille combined. The league's other big guns (Lyon, Marseille or even Bordeaux) have never collectively underachieved like they have so far in 2015-16. We've also never seen a team like Troyes this year, without a single league win before the winter break.\n\nIt has been fascinating to watch a special team like this PSG squad. It is already exciting to think about the battle for the rest of the top three and amusing to bet on when (or even if) Troyes will finally get their first win of the season.\n\nBest player: Zlatan Ibrahimovic, PSG\n\nObviously, one name rises above all the others: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He's the outstanding player of the season so far. He's only played 14 league games due to an injury at the start of the campaign, but he has scored 15 goals already and tallied six assists. His goal per minute ratio (one per 74 minutes) is incredible, and only Karim Benzema (one goal per 72 minutes) has done better in Europe. He has also been a genuine leader for PSG, both on and off the pitch, even though everybody expected him to decline as he turned 34 in October. But like the good french wine, Ibra gets better with age.\n\nThe other name worthy of consideration is Marseille midfielder Lassana Diarra. After not playing for 15 months because of a dispute with his former club, Lokomotiv Moscow, l'OM took a gamble on the 30-year-old former Real Madrid player with a free transfer and hoped for the best. Diarra has been the best defensive midfielder in Ligue 1, carrying Marseille and earning his way back into the national team a full five years after his last cap.\n\nIbrahimovic has continued to perform at a high level for PSG despite being hampered by injury early in the season.\n\nCaen striker Andy Delort deserves a mention as well for his wonderful displays, his energy and his six goals so far, which have launched tiny Caen into 4th while Thiago Silva and Angel Di Maria have also been excellent for PSG.\n\nMost disappointing player: Alexandre Lacazette, Lyon\n\nUnfortunately for Lyon fans, there have been many disappointments -- too many -- in their team this season. We could probably include the whole Lyon squad, apart from keeper Anthony Lopes and centre-half Samuel Umtiti. The biggest disappointment has to be Alexandre Lacazette. Last season's top scorer (27 goals in 33 league games) has only six so far this season compared to 17 heading into the winter break in 2014-15. Mathieu Valbuena, who came back to France in the summer, is another one who has not delivered. And I don't even want to talk about Mapou Yanga Mbiwa, who arrived from Roma in the summer and has been simply dreadful.\n\nMarseille's Nicolas Nkoulou was one of the best defenders in Ligue 1 last season but looks like a Ligue 2 player this year. The club also recruited Karim Rekik, the promising 20-year-old Dutch defender from Manchester City, but he has not convinced yet. The Stefan El Shaarawy project at AS Monaco has not worked so far: the Italian has failed to score so far in the league this season.\n\nBest signing: Cheikh N'Doye, Angers\n\nN'Doye is not the most famous Ligue 1 player, but his first-ever season in the French top flight has been sensational. The club signed the 29-year-old Senegalese international on a free from second division Cr\u00e9teil, where he played the last three seasons. He is tall, physical and good in the air both offensively (five league goals already) and defensively. He has emerged as a leader and is one of the major reasons that Angers finish 2015 in third place.\n\nDi Maria deserves a mention after being so influential for PSG (nine goals and 11 assists in all competitions). I guess when you spend \u20ac62 million on a player, you expect that kind of output, but the Argentine has taken PSG to a new level.\n\nBen Arfa's form for Nice has been a positive this season, with seven goals and two assists in Ligue 1 so far.\n\nNice had to wait six months before finally signing Hatem Ben Arfa in the summer but it was worth the wait. He has been excellent for them, scoring spectacular goals, showing real leadership and turning out more mature performances that saw him being called back for France too.\n\nAt the top of the goal-scoring charts, everybody expected to see Ibrahimovic, Michy Batshuayi and Edinson Cavani, but Lorient's Benjamin Moukandjo was surprise. He only cost \u20ac1 million from Reims, but with 11 goals already in the league, he has done almost as well as he did in his full last two seasons in Ligue 1 (14 goals in total).\n\nBiggest surprise: Gazelec Ajaccio\n\nEverybody predicted that the smallest club ever to be promoted to Ligue 1 would go straight back down after a terrible season. With their small budget, tiny stadium, limited training resources and policy of recruiting only loanees and free transfers, they could only go down.\n\nAfter no wins in their first 10 league games (seven defeats and three draws), that prediction looked certain to come true. But then their fate turned. Their first win, a 3-1 victory at home to Nice in Week 11, changed everything, and they are unbeaten since with six wins and three draws. They got a point away at Marseille, beat Lyon and Bordeaux, and are now 12th in the table, five points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nOf course, Angers have enjoyed a special first half of the season as well. Having returned to the top flight after a 21-year absence, they have shocked the league and currently sit in third. Caen have been a breath of fresh air, too -- a very similar run to Leicester City, going from fighting against relegation last season to fourth place.\n\nIt was also as surprising to see Lyon and Marseille's collapse. From league leaders last season to mid-table average teams this season, they have struggled.\n\nBest goal: Ben Arfa, Nice at AS Saint-Etienne\n\nThere have been a few -- like Ibrahimovic's half volley against Caen, Gregory Pujol's Marco van Basten-esque volley for Ajaccio vs. Nice, Kamil Grosicki (Stade Rennais vs. Montpellier), Valentin Rongier (Nantes vs. Troyes) or Di Maria at Nantes -- that could be mentioned too, but there could be only one winner: Hatem Ben Arfa, with a very special goal away at ASSE back in September.\n\nIt was a typical HBA goal: the 28-year-old received the ball 30 yards away from goal, dribbled past five opponents with skills and pace, and finished the whole move nicely.\n\nBest game: PSG 5, Lyon 1\n\nLast season, Lyon traveled to the Parc des Princes at the same stage of the season and left Paris with a point (1-1) after a very encouraging performance. This year's fixture was the total opposite. On Dec. 13, last season's runners-up were simply outclassed by the champions, who could have scored even more and only gifted Lyon a goal thanks to a Kevin Trapp howler.\n\nAgain, there have been a few other great games this season. like Marseille's 6-0 rout of Troyes in Week 2, Michel's first game as l'OM manager. We saw Nabil Fekir's first professional hat trick in a fantastic performance as Lyon thrashed Caen 4-0 in Week 4. Unfortunately, it would be his last league game before a very serious knee injury.\n\nNice thrashed Bordeaux 6-1 in Week 7. Marseille competed with PSG for 45 minutes in their high-quality clash at the Parc des Princes in Week 9 but still lost 2-1. Nice played the perfect game against Lyon at home in Week 14, winning 3-0, while the 3-3 draw between Marseille and Lyon in Week 15 (3-3) was another genuine thriller.\n\nPrediction for the rest of the season\n\nIt is not about who will be champion, it's about when will PSG be crowned. My prediction is that it will happen at some point in March, a la Bayern Munich. The Parisians will continue on their current form and should even stay unbeaten for the whole league campaign. The most interesting dates on their calendar will be in the Champions League, starting with Chelsea in the last 16 on February 16 and March 9.\n\nThe real question in Ligue 1 is who will finish second and third. Can Monaco stay second? What of Angers and Caen right behind them? Nice and Saint-Etienne are only three points behind Monaco, Lyon are six behind and Marseille, seven. Can any of them make it into the Top 3?\n\nI think Monaco will be there with Lyon, while down the bottom of the table, Troyes will go down alongside Reims and Toulouse.\n\nJulian Laurens is a London-based French journalist who writes for ESPN FC and Le Parisien.

The appearance on the big screens of the manager before matches has been greeted with jeers in recent weeks as the team, and the club, lurch from one disaster to the next.\n\nManagers of Real Madrid have a lot to deal with -- the weight of expectation, a demanding support, a rather \"hands-on\" club president and the voracious Spanish media. And then there is the dressing room. And the necessity to win every game, preferably in style.\n\nMany have crumbled under the pressure. Jose Antonio Camacho remains a personal favourite: \"I could see that I was surplus to requirements,\" he said after a few games in charge in 2004. His previous spell, in 1998, lasted 22 days.\n\nFew that have taken up the challege have thrived. Carlo Ancelotti had the measure of the board and the players, and the respect, admiration -- even love -- of the latter.\n\nBenitez, at the moment, falls somewhere in between.\n\nReal Madrid Real Madrid Rayo Vallecano Rayo Vallecano 10 2 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nPerformances\n\nOn the pitch there is a lot of room for improvement. At this stage of last season, with more or less the same group of players, Ancelotti was overseeing a 22-game winning streak culminating in a Club World Cup victory. It's not a comparison Benitez would welcome (and one that oddly hasn't been raised in press conferences) but it's there in the background, undermining everything the current manager does.\n\nReal haven't clicked under Benitez. For every battering (Betis, Espanyol, Malmo) there has been a limp draw (Malaga, Sporting) a lucky escape (Atletico) or a loss to a side that was simply better on the day (Sevilla, Barcelona, Villarreal).\n\nBenitez has been hampered by injuries but has selected the same 11 only twice in 23 games in all competitions this season, against Betis (5-0) and Barca (0-4). He has also been accused of the ultimate offence to the Bernabeu faithful: sacrificing his principles to keep his paymasters happy. Before Barcelona visited Madrid, Benitez had played a 4-3-3 in seven consecutive league matches, only reverting to a 4-4-2 with two defensive midfielders in Paris during the same period.\n\nSwitching his formation to accommodate half-fit players in James Rodriguez, Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale for the Clasico not only betrayed a lack of assertiveness, it also betrayed those who had been performing well up to that point, Casemiro and Isco chief among them. If he is axed at the end of the season, or before then, the Clasico will go down as Benitez's Waterloo.\n\nStill, in a refreshingly competitive league this season, Real are just two points adrift of Atletico and Barcelona -- who have a game in hand but have taken just two points from their last two Liga fixtures. Atletico lost to Malaga on Sunday, missing out on the chance to open up a five-point advantage over their city rivals. Both Madrid teams have been beaten by Villarreal in El Madrigal. Benitez can, for now, still look towards the end of the campaign with a valid measure of hope.\n\nThe ESPN FC crew discuss whether or not it was wrong of Real Madrid to score 10 goals against 9-man Rayo Vallecano.\n\nFans\n\nThe Bernabeu is not an easy stadium to tame. It's not quite as mental as Valencia -- a club that could make a decent few euros by selling branded white hankies in the club shop -- but there is a simple rule at Real: win, and win pretty. So far, Benitez has been doing neither with sufficient regularity.\n\nThere isn't a season-ticket holder who wouldn't swap the 5-0 against Betis, the slaughter of a half-holidaying Malmo or the embarrassment of a valiant Rayo for a decent performance against Barcelona. Losing is one thing. Doing so while nervously glancing towards the presidential box is quite another. Benitez's ploy was fairly obvious: lose with the Galacticos on the pitch and it's not his fault. Lose with Isco, Jese and Lucas Vazquez (who didn't even make the bench) and it's on him. Form and fitness be damned.\n\nBenitez lost the fans that day and he has not made the slightest inroad into the discontent festering in the stands since. Worse still, he won't acknowledge it. After the Rayo match he claimed he had emerged from the dressing room late and therefore \"didn't hear\" the cacophony of malice aimed at him.\n\nIt would have been perfectly audible to anyone emerging late from the metro stop on the other side of the Castellana.\n\nBenitez has taken care to treat the fans with respect. They are, after all, the slayer of many managers before him. Perez rules over Real as a modern day Caesar and is acutely fearful of the mob. If it comes down to him or Benitez, there is only going to be one outcome.\n\nDressing room\n\nIt was always going to be difficult for anybody to step into Ancelotti's shoes. When it became apparent that the Italian was for the chop senior players took the unprecedented step of publicly supporting their manager. Cristiano Ronaldo said this month that he misses the Italian: \"He's like a big bear, I can say. He's a cute guy ... an unbelievable person. I just wish every player could have an opportunity to work with him because he's a fantastic guy, a fantastic coach.\"\n\nSuffice it to say the chances of any of Real's squad saying that about Benitez are as likely as nine-man Rayo beating Madrid at the Bernabeu.\n\nMedia\n\nPerez is obsessed with the idea of Real Madrid as a \"club senor,\" which can be roughly translated a \"gentlemanly club.\" That means that any representative has to toe the line. Jose Mourinho lost the dressing room, alienated the board, divided the Bernabeu, caused the sporting directorship to be discarded and stuck his thumb into the eye of the eminently more gentlemanly Tito Vilanova, but his poisonous relationship with the press played an equal part in his downfall.\n\nBenitez's tearful presentation was lapped up and in the early days his back-slapping camaraderie was a welcome addition to a league accustomed to managers unafraid to show emotion and to speak their mind.\n\nIt didn't last long. Recently Benitez has been prickly. When Luis Enrique or Diego Simeone answer a question with a gruff one-liner or basically refuse to do so at all, it is accepted as part of their persona. And they do it with an accommodating smile.\n\nBenitez doesn't wear that hat well at all. He takes press persecution personally and that is not a good stance in a country where the sports papers outsell the broadsheets. Perez takes the club's image equally seriously and like it or not, the manager has to deal with the media.\n\nNobody should take the media too seriously of course, especially in Spain. But while the sports papers won't bring down a government, or help form a new one, they have been instrumental in the past in destroying a Real manager or two.\n\nBenitez should take heed from a predecessor as the second half of the season approaches. To borrow from Camacho again: \"I thought when I started [at Real Madrid] that football was more important than anything else, but to my surprise it turned out that everything else was more important than football.\"\n\nRob Train is a freelance writer who lives in Madrid, covers Real Madrid for ESPN and contributes to a number of other publications.

Missed chances rule the day for both clubs\n\nAnother day, another disappointing big game in the Premier League. Leicester and Manchester City played uninspiring football after Manchester United and Chelsea played out a 0-0 draw on Monday.\n\nThe visitors had the majority of possession and had long spells of dominance, but despite their incredibly talented and expensively assembled forward line, Man City could not break down a largely excellent Leicester defence. If ever a game was to sum up the Premier League this season, this was it. It was fast, frantic, involved a great deal of pressing and closing down, but also featured a large number of mistakes, moments of low quality and an alarming lack of poise in either penalty area.\n\nIt seemed impossible that Sergio Aguero managed to knock this chance over the crossbar.\n\nPlayers of high standing, large transfer fees and otherwise fine form seemed to line up to miss chances, from Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling, to Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez. This was an encounter of much bluster, but little end-product. Both goalkeepers were required to make saves, but most would have featured on blooper reels had they not been kept out. That one of the most notable elements of the fixture was Sterling's haircut should speak volumes.\n\nThat's not to say it wasn't entertaining in spells (because incompetence often is), and that there weren't moments of quality and good performances: Wes Morgan was excellent at the back for Leicester, N'Golo Kante continued to prove he was one of the shrewdest pieces of business last summer, while Kevin De Bruyne was always threatening for Manchester City.\n\nIt also represented something of an achievement for Manuel Pellegrini's men, as it was their first clean sheet of the season without Vincent Kompany, again absent after his aborted comeback on Boxing Day. As achievements go, one shutout for a central defensive partnership -- Eliaquim Mangala and Nicolas Otamendi -- that cost in the region of \u00a380 million is not exactly mind-blowing, but it's a start.\n\n2. The curious case of Yaya Toure\n\nYaya Toure is a rather curious player these days. In his better moments, he resembles the force of nature he was a few years ago, an unstoppable and marauding midfielder who could plough his way through defences and had a much more delicate touch than he was given credit. He was a couple of midfielders in one, allowing Roberto Mancini to play a 4-4-2 formation because he was everywhere. Mancini could push forward to create a Toure-shaped juggernaut in attack.\n\nThese days, at 32, Toure is a slightly less fearsome proposition. Or at least he is for the majority of games. He can still turn it on, and still does so, but only tends to in short spells. This was most evident against Arsenal when the Toure of 2015 turned into the Toure of 2012 in the last 15 minutes of the game, scoring a beautiful goal in the process. Of course, by that point, the game was more or less lost and the sudden finding of his mojo was virtually moot.\n\nThose 15 or so minutes in which he makes a difference can obviously be game-changing for City, but it would be entirely preferable for him to, well, offer a little more than a quarter of an hour for every 90 minutes. Still, 15 minutes was more than they got against Leicester, as Toure was largely anonymous throughout, outshone by Kante and Danny Drinkwater in the home midfield.\n\nToure wasn't spectacularly bad, but he also didn't contribute enough, and in games such as this, City need more from him. Indeed, if they are to win the title in this most open of seasons, they certainly need more from him.\n\nVardy had one or two good chances, but spent most of the day isolated up front.\n\n3. Vardy isolated, as Ranieri's formation ineffective\n\nLeicester changed formation slightly to incorporate an extra midfielder, specifically semi-forgotten man Gokhan Inler, into their side, presumably to try and deal with the waspish threat of David Silva. The formation was roughly 4-1-4-1, with Inler sitting deep and Danny Drinkwater and Kante in front of him -- not the most attacking of central midfield trios.\n\nThe theory was fine, but it was executed slightly strangely, because they seemed to spend the majority of the first half bypassing that midfield and hoofing the ball over their heads in the general direction of Vardy, who was ploughing the loneliest of furrows up front on his own. Vardy was remarkably isolated, and although he did his best to unsettle Mangala and Otamendi (not always the most onerous of tasks), his effectiveness was stymied by a lack of support.\n\nMark Albrighton and Mahrez did their best from wide positions, but in general, their threat came from their own efforts, rather than trying to supply Vardy. Leonardo Ulloa came on in the second half, in theory to lend Vardy a hand, but in the end, he contributed relatively little, frequently finding himself on the left wing for reasons unclear.\n\nIt seemed like a performance designed to get a point, rather than go for a win, which was rather curious given how Leicester have played to get themselves in this position. They have been a counter-attacking team all season but have relied on their forwards' thrilling pace to slice and dice opponents, making them very effective and highly entertaining.\n\nThis was a game against the most dangerous attacking quartet in the Premier League, so an element of caution is understandable. But it would be a shame if Leicester were to move away from the principles and tactics that got them to the top of the league in games such as this.\n\nNick Miller is a football writer for ESPN FC, the Guardian, Eurosport and a number of other publications.

The four goals make up a fifth of their total for the season so far while at the other end, it was far from another clean sheet as they conceded three goals for the first time this term.\n\nDespite the three points it was arguably a below-par performance from the Potters in a surprisingly open match that had plenty of tired legs and minds on show.\n\nThere were some poor lapses of judgement and concentration but as a spectacle it was a fascinating game that ebbed and flowed to a conclusion that favoured the visitors.\n\nEverton Everton Stoke City Stoke City 3 4 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10=best; players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating):\n\nGK Jack Butland, 6 -- A difficult game for the goalkeeper, who was left exposed by those in front of him. Couldn't do much about any of the goals and will be looking forward to not having to face Romelu Lukaku again any time soon.\n\nDF Glen Johnson, 6 -- Had a difficult game against the marauding Brendan Galloway and the fleet-footed Ross Barkley.\n\nDF Ryan Shawcross, 7 -- Will thankfully not come up against the power and movement of a front line like this until the two sides meet later in the season. Didn't manage any tackles or interceptions but made a couple of crucial blocks.\n\nDF Philipp Wollscheid, 8 -- Had a shaky first half as Lukaku dragged him up field, only to turn him and race away far too easily. Successfully dropped off his man as the game went on. Put in some impressive tackles and interceptions with many of the opposition attacks coming down his side. Had a 96 percent passing accuracy.\n\nDF Erik Pieters, 8 -- Fared admirably given he was up against the tricky Gerard Deulofeu who was relentless in his attacks down Stoke's left.\n\nMF Geoff Cameron, 6 -- A really poor showing from the American, who had done so well in recent weeks. Possibly still nursing an injury, he was off the pace and didn't track back in the first half. His refusal to get back and defend in the run-up to Everton's first goal was disappointing.\n\nMF Glenn Whelan, 7 -- Displayed an impressive range of passing and was far more positive in his play than fans are used to.\n\nMF Ibrahim Afellay, 8 -- Mr. Consistency.

Scored a contender for goal of the season with an audacious chip over Tim Howard. Yes, he meant it.\n\nFW Bojan Krkic, 8 -- When an obvious pass wasn't available, his ability to ghost past defenders was crucial in creating space and opportunities for his teammates. An exquisite assist for Shaqiri's second goal.\n\nFW Marko Arnautovic, 9 -- Going from strength to strength and enjoying the responsibility of drifting into the central striking role. Has grown into the most influential player in the side and his consistency is the highlight of the season.

Made one successful pass.", "Real Madrid should not re-hire Jose Mourinho": "Jose Mourinho's divisive presence is not what Los Blancos need at the moment.\n\nThe end of Jose Mourinho's second tenure with Chelsea predictably provoked a journalistic tsunami in the UK. Most sports outlets on TV, radio and the web devoted a considerable amount of time and space to analyse the reasons behind what the club called a mutual parting of ways.\n\nYou may well imagine that Spain followed the UK closely in terms of media coverage. Mourinho's links with the country are strong: Initially employed as Sir Bobby Robson's translator and then as his assistant with Barcelona back in 1996, he became Real Madrid's coach 14 years later. One can safely state that neither Spanish football as a whole nor Real Madrid have been the same after he joined the club.\n\nMou's spell in the Spanish capital was profoundly divisive for Real Madrid fans. A sizeable portion of supporters still feel nostalgia from his three-year tenure and wish Mourinho back at the Santiago Bernabeu. At the other side of the spectrum -- and with very few fans in the middle -- one can find the rest of the Madridistas filled with righteous wrath at the mere thought of the Portuguese wearing his branded scarf in the dugout of the Real Madrid stadium again.\n\nThe timing of Mourinho's departure from Chelsea seems almost scripted. Just as reports announce Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich exit, Carlo Ancelotti still looks for a team and Louis van Gaal feels the heat with Manchester United, the Christmas season arrives full of promise.\n\nBut the reason why the exit of the Portuguese coach generated such a huge amount of interest in Spain does not have much to do with the context of other top coaches. The delicate situation that Rafael Benitez is currently undergoing with Real Madrid, and, at least on paper, the obvious possibility of Mourinho coming back to Madrid are more than enough to fill an edition of any Spanish sports newspaper.\n\nShortly after the news from London arrived, Marca.com launched a survey asking whether Florentino Perez should hire Mourinho again. The results after 30.000+ votes were quite telling: 50 percent voted yes, and 50 percent voted no. That is the best illustration of the impact the Portuguese coach had on the Real Madrid fans and on La Liga followers in general.\n\nAnd should Real Madrid hire him again? Mourinho indeed counts on the support of the club. For instance, the biggest decision-maker in the matter of hirings and sackings at Real Madrid, president Perez himself, praises the now ex-Chelsea boss every time he has the chance, and has never ruled out a comeback, but the contrary.\n\nDespite having won one Liga and one Copa del Rey title in three seasons, the popular support Mourinho enjoys in Madrid these two-and-a-half seasons since leaving is still remarkable.\n\nThe ESPN FC panel discuss Jose Mourinho's second tenure at Chelsea and what went wrong for him.\n\nBut the answer is no.\n\nReal Madrid should not bring back Mourinho, at least not in the middle of the season and with the squad they currently have. Even though Mou's biggest antagonist, Iker Casillas, has already left the team, there are still quite a few players that, to say it softly, don't get along with the Portuguese. Probably the best example is no other than skipper Sergio Ramos, who has repeatedly referred to Mourinho's spell with Real Madrid in no uncertain terms.\n\nWithin the dressing room, for each Alvaro Arbeloa -- a recognised fan of Mourinho -- there are at least three Sergios Ramos. Too many bridges were burnt within the squad, in a manner quite similar to that of his Chelsea exit, and it now seems quite difficult for him to make amends with such a large group of players who would hardly be motivated by having him as a coach again.\n\nEven assuming an unlikely reconciliation between Mourinho and the players, his comeback would still be questionable. The social divide generated by him is blatant and apparently irreconcilable. With the current run of results and after a trophy-less season in 2014-15, the last thing Los Blancos need is a stadium in which half the supporters want the coach to succeed, while the rest want him to fail and leave the club as soon as possible.\n\nOn top of this, Mourinho made very few friends outside of Real Madrid. Referees, journalists, the Spanish FA, opposition's players and coaches, and other entities related to the different tournaments were the target of Mou's sharp tongue and abuse. If Real Madrid usually face teams that want to earn their minutes of fame by defeating them, bringing back Mourinho to their bench would immediately turn them into the most coveted win in La Liga.\n\nBenitez hasn't had a decent chance at managing this club yet. His dismissal would not be entirely justified by what we've seen thus far, as the players should shoulder most of the blame for the poor results this season. But replacing Benitez with Mourinho would be an extremely ill-advised decision.\n\nThe former Inter Milan coach on the Real Madrid bench would be a phenomenal marketing stunt and huge generator of news, but a move with very little potential from the footballing perspective, especially with the current squad, and with terrible consequences from the social perspective within the club.\n\nAnd for some time it's seemed obvious that what the Madridistas really need currently is less marketing, less noise and more football and social peace.\n\nEduardo is a football analyst for ESPN FC, BBC Sportsworld and Radio Marca.

A 2-0 defeat to Norwich on Monday has serious and very sad ramifications for Villa's immediate future; the club will begin 2016 on just eight points. Not only that, Remi Garde's team is now 11 points from safety and 12 behind Norwich -- from here on in, what remains is a slow procession through fixtures until it is mathematically impossible to stay in the league.\n\nVilla were poor at Carrow Road. The hosts weren't much better but they didn't need to be. After a bright start by Villa the customary soft goal they conceded -- Jonny Howson was allowed way too much space at the far post to score with a left-footed drive -- put Norwich in control and that was pretty much that with regard to a meaningful contest. A late second goal by Dieumerci Mbokani finished the game off.\n\nGarde's team selection deserves to be questioned if not criticised. The manager made two changes in central defence, dropping both Jores Okore and Joleon Lescott while recalling Micah Richards and Ciaran Clark. Okore and Lescott had played well in recent draws against West Ham and Newcastle; Garde's decision might have been founded in concern for the duo playing again within a couple of days. Okore has only just returned after injury and Lescott's fitness need careful management. Nevertheless, the changes didn't help defensive stability but bringing Kieran Richardson back into the starting line-up defied explanation.\n\nIn a game that Villa really had to win, the team was low on quality and devoid of inspiration. There is an almost insurmountable mountain to climb now and though the January transfer window opens shortly, Garde has to wonder who he can persuade to join a club virtually resigned to being in the Championship in 2016-17.\n\nNorwich City Norwich City Aston Villa Aston Villa 2 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10=best; players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating):\n\nGK Brad Guzan, 6 -- Lucky to get away without conceding when he spilled Nathan Redmond's shot but deserves a certain amount of sympathy for playing behind Villa's calamitous defence.\n\nDF Alan Hutton, 5 -- Seems unable to cope with opposing wingers who drift close to the touchline. Had a tough afternoon.\n\nDF Micah Richards, 5 -- Back in the side after injury but lost Howson for the opener and was booked late on as tempers flared.\n\nDF Ciaran Clark, 5 -- Recalled to the heart of the defence but terrible marking for Norwich's second goal as Mbokani just drifted away from him to head home at close range. Just turned around to watch the Norwich striker score - a basic error.\n\nDF Leandro Bacuna, 6 -- It's not his fault he's being asked to play out of position, and his defensive inexperience showed again when his weak header failed to clear the danger in the build-up to Norwich's first goal.\n\nMF Scott Sinclair, 5 -- Restored to the starting line-up but did little to justify his place. Ineffective and the first player taken off by Garde.\n\nMF Ashley Westwood, 6 -- Did reasonably well, but isn't as strong without Carlos Sanchez beside him in the centre of midfield. Booked and is suspended for the next match, against Sunderland on Jan. 2.\n\nJordan Ayew, right, was typically threatening but Aston Villa slid closer to relegation after Monday's loss.\n\nMF Idrissa Gana, 6 -- Tried hard enough, tackling with enthusiasm but lacking quality.\n\nMF Kieran Richardson, 5 -- A really surprising decision by Garde to start with Richardson, who shouldn't be anywhere near the first X1. Average at best.\n\nMF Jordan Veretout, 6 -- One of Villa's better performers in recent games and again at Carrow Road but substituted late on.\n\nFW Jordan Ayew, 7 -- Villa's most dangerous attacking player. Should have scored when his header was saved by Declan Rudd and troubled the Norwich defence with his incisive running. His fifth yellow card of the season makes him unavailable against Sunderland; he'll be badly missed.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nFW Adama Traore, 6 -- Replaced Sinclair after 58 minutes. A raw talent who needs to develop his game but his pace and direct running unsettled Norwich. With nothing to lose now, surely Garde could do worse than abandon caution and unleash the former Barcelona winger from the start?\n\nFW Rudy Gestede, 6 -- Replaced Bacuna after 69 minutes. Put himself about with gusto but couldn't bring Villa back into the game.\n\nMF Jack Grealish, N/R -- Replaced Veretout after 81 minutes.

And despite the 23-year-old only having signed from Pachuca to Tigres last summer there have been plenty of rumors that he could be on the move once again.\n\nArsenal, PSG and Sporting Lisbon are on the list of possible suitors, but they'll have to pay the reigning Liga MX champion around US$15 million if they are to prize the flying winger from Tigres' clutches.\n\nOther youngsters that could move to Europe at some point include Pachuca trio Erick Gutierrez, Hirving Lozano and Rodolfo Pizarro, but Los Tuzos appear to be intent on holding onto them for the time being.\n\nOf the Mexican contingent in Europe, Alan Pulido's situation remains complicated, following his protracted contract dispute with Tigres.\n\nThe striker -- a veteran of the last World Cup squad -- has hardly played since Brazil 2014 and has been short of action at current club Olympiakos, raising the possibility of a move back to Mexico.\n\nChivas appeared to be in pole position for Pulido, who said he has offers from Europe, but owner club Jorge Vergara believes the player has already blown his chance by not backing down from his accusation that Tigres illegally extended his contract.\n\nVergara accused Pulido of committing \"career suicide\" and Olympiakos of simply using the Mexican to make some easy money.\n\n\"I believe it is a big error from Pulido,\" Vergara told ESPN. \"Someone who doesn't play in his team in Greece [and doesn't move on] is someone who is unfortunately going to disappear.\"\n\nTigres flyer Jurgen Damm has been linked with the likes of Arsenal, PSG and Sporting Lisbon.\n\nThere has also been a suggestion that Pulido may have a juicy offer from MLS.\n\nAnother player without minutes and in limbo in Europe is Guillermo Ochoa, who will be surely hoping to move on this January, having played a total of zero La Liga games for Malaga since starring for El Tri at the last World Cup.\n\nVeracruz expressed a desire to bring Ochoa back to Mexico, but the goalkeeper's people apparently have other plans for him, according to Tiburones Rojos owner Fidel Kuri.\n\nThe only other reported interested has been from Toulouse in Ligue 1, although Malaga's directors have previously stated that Ochoa can leave if the right offer comes in.\n\nFinally, there always seems to be some transfer speculation surrounding Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez, and after his brilliant start to life in the Bundesliga with Bayer Leverkusen, there are reports a move back to England is a possibility, with Arsenal mentioned.\n\nTom Marshall has been based in Guadalajara since 2008 and has written about Mexican football ever since.

Made some key saves during the game to make up for it, while there was little he could have done on either goal having been let down by his defence.\n\nDF Ignazio Abate, 7 -- A rare goal for the right-back got Milan back in the game, and ultimately it made up for his poor crossing throughout the contest. Always a willing runner down the right flank, but needs to be decisive more consistently.\n\nDF Alex, 6 -- The Brazilian was badly caught out for the opening goal as Frosinone were able to cut right through the heart of the Milan defence with Alex nowhere to be seen. Atoned for his mistake with a crucial goal to put daylight between the two sides.\n\nDF Alessio Romagnoli, 6 -- Not the best performance that the 20-year-old has produced this season, as he was troubled when put under pressure and wasn't as commanding as usual. Was a reason behind the disappointing defensive display, but it's unlikely that we'll see too many more like it.\n\nDF Mattia De Sciglio, 6 -- Couldn't match Abate's success on the opposite flank, and although he remains a solid presence in the team, there is an argument to suggest that De Sciglio hasn't kicked on enough and needs to improve his all-round game.\n\nMF Keisuke Honda, 6 -- Handed a rare start by Mihajlovic after spending much of the last two months on the bench. The Japanese international produced a tireless effort and made sacrifices for the team, but if he wants to keep his place he will need to be more decisive in the final third.\n\nMF Riccardo Montolivo, 6 -- Another disappointing performance from the captain. Given the importance of his role, he needs to be more composed in possession particularly when Milan are dominating proceedings as they did on Sunday evening. Battled well but it is not enough at the heart of the starting XI.\n\nMF Andrea Bertolacci, 6 -- Milan look to be a better side with the former Genoa man in midfield and it is hoped that he can now stay fit and get a run in the side. His combative nature combined with his assured play on the ball make him a potentially integral part of the team and in turn could solve the issues in the middle of the pitch.\n\nMF Giacomo Bonaventura, 8 -- Not for the first time, Bonaventura stood out as the star man as he was always at the heart of everything good from Milan. Importantly, the 26-year-old is not afraid to try and make something happen even when things aren't going well for the team, and he capped off a great night with a late goal to seal the victory.\n\nFW Carlos Bacca, 6 -- His first touch wasn't always the best and so his link-up play needs to improve. However, the Colombian international provides an important presence up front and produced a real poacher's goal to make it eight for the campaign.\n\nFW M'Baye Niang, 6 -- Lively display and was a constant problem for the Frosinone backline with his pace, trickery and movement. Still needs to add consistency to his play in the final third, and if he can find that then he will be a dangerous proposition for any team.\n\nSubstitutes\n\nFW Luiz Adriano, N/R -- The Brazilian striker wasn't given enough time to make an impact and will hope for more opportunities in 2016.\n\nMF Andrea Poli, N/R -- Late introduction based purely on helping Milan see out the game and pick up the three points.\n\nSumeet Paul has written for various websites providing Serie A coverage.

The Dutchman was 25 yards away from David De Gea, but the ball travelled just three yards in his header back to the goalkeeper and Bojan capitalised.\n\nStoke's second goal came when Ashley Young opted to block the ball with his hand, instead of his head, on the edge of the penalty area. Depay was at fault again when failing to close down Marko Arnautovic as he struck the ball brilliantly.\n\nManchester United Manchester United Chelsea Chelsea 0 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nThere was a feeling that after this game, particularly in light of Van Gaal's abrupt prematch news conference, that the manager was on borrowed time. Surely this was just one poor performance too many?\n\nHowever, Van Gaal was still in charge for the Chelsea game. To be fair to him, United were much better in this 0-0 draw, and on another day would have won. Juan Mata and Anthony Martial both hit the woodwork, United should have had two penalties -- for a foul on Mata and handball from Willian -- and Thibaut Courtois made a world-class save to deny Ander Herrera, who revealed after the game that he was ready to celebrate before he realised his attempt had somehow been kept out.\n\nAt a different point in this season, United fans might be more forgiving of the result against Chelsea, but since it was the eighth game in a row in which United failed to win, patience has run out. Van Gaal's men have drawn seven and lost one of their most recent games at home, with the last first-half goal scored by the home side at Old Trafford coming way back in September. And that was a penalty.\n\nUnited's next two fixtures are both at home, with them first taking on Swansea in the league before facing Sheffield United in the FA Cup. If Van Gaal can't win both of these games convincingly, his time must surely be up.\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin had some words of encouragement for the fans, revealing there were discussions before the Chelsea game among the players that stressed the importance of playing attacking football. While United didn't set the world alight on Monday evening, the football was certainly an improvement over what has been dished out recently. They did create fantastic opportunities to score, which is more than can be said of most of their games in recent months.\n\nStill, United's opposition were a team who, despite being champions, are just three points away from the relegation zone, and we are now halfway through the season. How much positivity can fans really muster for a goalless draw at home against a team in a relegation scrap?\n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, and even fans who have long said they wouldn't want Jose Mourinho anywhere near their club are now changing their minds. The craving for silverware, with withdrawal symptoms reaching a new high after decades of being spoilt by Sir Alex Ferguson, means that all common sense is going out the window.\n\nUnited supporters are well aware that after two or three years of Mourinho, the club could be in a much worse position than they are currently. The Portuguese has shown in previous jobs that he doesn't leave much of a legacy, but at least chances are good that they will have won a trophy or two by then.\n\nFaith in Van Gaal's ability to guide United to any success has faded to near nonexistence. The chances of United winning the FA Cup or Europa League while he is still in charge, when they struggle to even score a goal, are slim to none. And the hope of featuring in next season's Champions League is fading quickly thanks to the impressive form Tottenham and Leicester City have shown this year. United are five points off fourth place amid this run of desperate form.\n\nIt would be easier to predict what the club were planning to do if they had a history of behaving in a rational manner. However, they replaced Ferguson, the greatest manager of all time, with David Moyes, so who knows what they are thinking?\n\nIf Van Gaal can't muster two wins out of two in the easy games ahead, he should be sacked.\n\nAnd yet in a bizarre twist, there's no guarantee the club will finally act and remove the manager.\n\nScott is a season-ticket holder from Manchester who set up The Republik of Mancunia in 2006.

Courtois would also have been grateful to the woodwork behind him which came to his rescue on a couple of occasions when beaten by strikes from Juan Mata and Anthony Martial.\n\nThe delusional verdict on the Blues' official website referred to \"lifting upwards\" but Chelsea are floundering and Hiddink doesn't have the players at his disposal to remedy the situation. He had a unified dressing room of stars to work with when he was first given the interim job, in 2009. Among them were Petr Cech, Ashley Cole, Terry, Michael Essien, Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba; the core of team synonymous with silverware and success in the Roman Abramovich era.\n\nOnly Terry remains and, while his presence cannot be underestimated, the captain's best days are behind him. Meanwhile, the January transfer window may provide Hiddink with stop-gap solutions in attack, but Chelsea's problems run far deeper. They've lost their aura of invincibility and the warning signs of impending disaster were all there.\n\nWhen Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003, Arsenal and Manchester United were the two dominant forces in the English game but the Russian had ambition and an incredible bankroll. With money no object, Abramovich rapidly transformed the Blues' fortunes. To date, 15 trophies have been won including four Premier Leagues, four FA Cups and the Champions League. It's a phenomenal achievement in a comparatively short space of time which is put into perspective by the fact that since their formation in 1905, up until 2003 Chelsea had only won 11 trophies.\n\nThibaut Courtois says Chelsea are not panicking despite their perilous position.\n\nSince 2003, more than 100 players have been transferred in and out of the club and Abramovich's notorious impatience for success has seen 11 different managers take charge. The owner has ploughed \u00a3100 million into the club's youth academy yet they haven't produced a single first-team regular.\n\nAbramovich is soon to embark on a complete redevelopment of Stamford Bridge that is likely to cost in excess of \u00a3500m. The new stadium will house 60,000 spectators, an increase of almost 20,000. But what type of team will these supporters be watching; champions or also-rans?\n\nChelsea's succession planning looks appalling. Who is going to manage the team in the long-term and who will replace club legend Terry? Abramovich's hire and fire routine has worked so far but world-class options are thin on the ground. As far as silverware is concerned, boom may just have turned to bust in SW6.\n\nThe decision to sack Jose Mourinho for a second time may come back to haunt Chelsea. The Portuguese is a serial winner and if, as expected, he stays in the Premier League, what then?\n\nThere are three domestic trophies up for grabs each season and the world has moved on since 2003. Competition is fiercer than ever. Arsenal, United and Chelsea have been joined and surpassed in the moneybags stakes by Manchester City. Liverpool are threatening a resurgence. Tottenham and West Ham will have new stadiums and ambitions to go with them. Then there are the likes of Stoke and Leicester City who have the desire and capability to upset the odds at any time.\n\nTo get back ahead of the pack, it seems that the only solution available to Abramovich is to spend big on a manager and players in the hope of starting the cycle of success again.\n\nMark Worrall has penned several books on the history and success of Chelsea Football Club.

Four weeks and one day earlier, heavily armed terrorists had sown havoc and murder, reminding Parisians of the fragility inherent in the world we inhabit.\n\nThere was no symbolic empty seat left in the hall for the most illustrious absentee, UEFA President Michel Platini. He campaigned hard for the competition to be held in France, his home country, 32 years after they last hosted the tournament and he led them to their first ever major championship. Platini is provisionally suspended for some of his financial dealings with FIFA, a ban that has scuppered his run for the FIFA presidency. He's fighting the charges but, at the very least, his absence reminded us of something else: it's hard to operate in the highest echelons of world football without smearing your collar, whether it's self-inflicted or brought on by others.\n\nNever before has a major UEFA tournament been held under such clouds.\n\nYet at the same time, there is also reason for optimism. Not just the kind that comes with the realization that, post-draw and pre-opener, everybody is level on points, from little Iceland to mighty Germany.\n\nFor the first time, the Euro has been expanded from 16 to 24 of UEFA's 54 member nations. While some purists sniff at the dilution of the tournament, anyone who saw the excitement in the eyes of those midsized nations who would otherwise not be here could not be somewhat moved.\n\nHaving 24 teams means the Euros will match the World Cup formats we witnessed between 1986 and 1994, with the four best third-place sides advancing alongside the top two in each group. While it's true that a group stage held to winnow the teams from 24 to 16 will feel different, it's equally true that it did not spoil our enjoyment in 1986 or 1990 or 1994 and it likely won't this time either.\n\nESPN FC's Santi Solari feels Croatia have the best midfield at the Euro's, but indicates Spain will still win the group.\n\nIf anything, the expanded Euros multiply the storylines. Germany, the defending world champions, will try to match what Spain achieved in 2010, Brazil in 2004, France in 2000 and the Germans themselves in 1972: holding both the world and continental titles at the same time.\n\nThe draw hasn't been kind to Germany. They will face a Poland side led by one of the most in-form forwards in the game, Robert Lewandowski; Ukraine, with the twin wing threat of Yevhen Konoplyanka and Andriy Yarmolenko; and Northern Ireland, who may be making their first-ever Euro appearance but nevertheless won their qualifying group.\n\nSpain, the defending champions looking to three-peat, also have a tough road filled with familiar faces: Croatia, led by the Liga-based duo of Ivan Rakitic and Luka Modric; Turkey, relying on the unpredictable whims of Barcelona's Arda Turan; and the Czechs, captained by Arsenal keeper Petr Cech.\n\nThe hosts, France, may be the next deepest team in terms of talent, with budding stars like Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann, though controversy (witness the Karim Benzema sex-tape blackmail affair) is never far behind. Their ride in Group A seems a little more straightforward, pitting them against Romania, Albania and Switzerland. The clash between Albania and Switzerland, two teams stocked with ethnic Kosovars, will be another reminder of the side effects of politics, war and migration.\n\nGroup B, with England chasing their first major trophy in half a century, will also have an air of familiarity thanks to Wales and the biggest superstar born on British soil in decades, Gareth Bale. Slovakia know how to upset the apple cart; ask Italy, whom they eliminated in the 2010 World Cup or, indeed, Spain, whom they beat in qualifying. Then there's Russia, the awakening giant throwing resources at the game with an eye to hosting the 2018 World Cup.\n\nBelgium's Golden Generation were pitted with the second seed most wanted to avoid, Italy. As most of the Diables Rouges/Rode Duivels (everything is strictly bilingual in Belgium) hit the prime of their careers -- guys like Eden Hazard, Kevin de Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois, Romelu Lukaku and Christian Benteke are all 24 years old or younger -- they'll be tested by a rebuilding Azzurri side whom manager Antonio Conte is constructing in his own blue-collar, hard-hat image.\n\nESPN FC's Ian Darke feels this could be a perfect time for England to triumph at the Euro's with Wayne Rooney as captain.\n\nBelgium will also face Sweden and the immense -- in every sense of the word -- Zlatan Ibrahimovic in what is likely to be his international swan song, and Martin O'Neill's Ireland, a side on which the LA Galaxy's Robbie Keane continues to defy Father Time and a team capable of taking four of six points from Germany in qualifying.\n\nIn some ways, Group F is the most romantic group. Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo, 12 years after making his tournament debut on home soil and suffering heartbreak in the final, will once again be asked to carry a nation, mindful of the fact that, to some, he is no longer an automatic choice as the \"other\" world's greatest footballer. Then there are Austria and Hungary, neighbours and fallen giants whose players are daily confronted with the fact that those who came before them -- Hugo Meisl's Wunderteam of the 1930s and the Mighty Magyars of Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis and Nandor Hidegkuti -- were at one time the greatest in the world. And, finally, Iceland: 329,000 people on a rocky, geyser-filled outpost abutting the Arctic Ocean. They're here, too, and they're here on merit.\n\nWhatever happens, we're going to remember this. And we'll most likely be glad that we opened the door that little bit wider, to let more nations in. Inclusion feels right, particularly at a time like this.\n\nGabriele Marcotti is a columnist for ESPN FC, The Times and Corriere dello Sport.

But we must congratulate our opponents because they played an intense match and won well.\"\n\nIndeed, Atleti had gone 15 games -- over two-and-a-half months -- without defeat, racking up 12 wins and just three draws in all competitions before their slip-up in Andalusia. It was a run that had seen them storm through to the last 16 of the Champions League and catapulted them back into the La Liga title race. Despite losing, they remain two points ahead of Real Madrid in third and are level on points with Barcelona, who have a game in hand.\n\nOn the face of it, a still-confident Colchoneros outfit could not ask for a better game. There is little travel involved and they are facing a team likely to have rock-bottom confidence levels having lost their last four in all competitions.\n\nThe side from the capital's Vallecas suburb are in big trouble and need a win, sitting in the final relegation place. The same game last season finished 0-0 and Atletico cannot afford a repeat of a night when profligate finishing cost them a nailed-on three points.\n\nLast time out Rayo were humiliated 10-2 by Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu and had two men -- Roman Triguero and Raul Baena -- sent off and so the pair will be absent for the upcoming meeting; a problem Atleti will also face with two regulars suspended.\n\nSkipper Gabi, who was stupidly sent off with a half hour to go against Malaga, will sit this one out as will Filipe Luis, who picked up his fifth yellow of the season in the defeat. The captain has been back to somewhere near his best this term, however his hare-brained decision to handle the ball just moments after receiving a first yellow cost the side dearly.\n\nHis place in the starting XI will likely go to youngster Oliver Torres and a good performance from Oliver, coupled with the imminent arrivals of Augusto Fernandez and Matias Kranevitter, could mean that the 32-year-old will struggle to regain a regular starting berth.\n\nIt is especially pertinent as Atleti are very much building for the future and preparing for a changing of the guard with the injured Tiago. If he is not careful, Gabi's moment of indiscretion could mean he loses his regular place. Oliver has proven on a number of occasions this season that he has the ability to play at the highest level and alongside Saul, Koke and Yannick Carrasco they will have a youthful midfield full of energy and promise.\n\nFilipe's place will go to Guilherme Siqueira, who will be another player determined to prove his worth. The Brazilian has been snubbed for the majority of the season for his more consistent countryman and has been mooted as a possible departee, however with the side fighting on three fronts -- including an upcoming Copa del Rey tie against Rayo -- Simeone needs a big, united squad all pulling in the same direction and Siqueira will want to be in the side come the business end of the season.\n\nWith the back five picking itself, the one remaining doubt for Atleti will, as ever, be who partners with Antoine Griezmann in attack. With Jackson Martinez attracting attention as January looms and still without the medical all-clear, it is a toss up between Luciano Vietto and Fernando Torres.\n\nThe Argentine was largely ineffective against Malaga and replaced by Torres, who fluffed a number of opportunities and is still waiting for goal number 100 in a Rojiblanco shirt. After scoring number 99 in September, it's high time that the wait comes to an end, as patience can only be stretched so far, even for a club legend.\n\nEl Nino has only six months remaining on his deal and if he has aspirations to remain at the top level will need to get his act together, sharpish.\n\nWith all three forwards misfiring, there is the threat of a move being made for another striker next month. They would not have to do much to better the efforts of the side's three number nines. Hopefully the presence of the transfer window hanging over them will have the desired effect and spur them into action. Their side needs them.\n\nJoseph is a sports journalist based in the Spanish capital and covers Atletico Madrid regularly.

At Sevilla [on loan last season] he did not get playing time, and at Villarreal he is doing very well. He could be an interesting player.\"\n\nNew arrivals in January could mean some players are moved on from the Camp Nou, with Luis Enrique suggesting: \"That is a possibility. Everything is under consideration. If there are players coming in, others could leave. You can always improve the squad.\"\n\nBlaugrana talisman Lionel Messi is set to make his 500th Barca appearance in Wednesday's game. However, the 28-year-old may not start having been at Sunday's Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai after spending Christmas in Argentina with his extended family, and having been troubled by a liver problem while in Japan at the Club World Cup just before the winter break.\n\nEither way, a repeat of the row 12 months ago when Messi was benched for Barca's first game back looks unlikely, according to Luis Enrique.\n\n\"That is the fear you always have when you come back from a few days off,\" he said. \"But they have all arrived very fresh, motivated and ambitious. That makes me very optimistic.\"\n\nLio Messi has picked up another individual accolade, being named Player of the Year at the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai.\n\nLionel Messi will play his 500th game for Barcelona when Luis Enrique's men welcome Real Betis to the Nou Camp.\n\nFormer Real Madrid manager Fabio Capello says Lionel Messi's absence due to injury was a good thing for Barcelona.\n\nBarcelona claimed five trophies in 2015, making them arguably the best team in 2015.\n\nBarca spent the winter break top of the Primera Division on head-to-head record with Atletico Madrid, and just two points ahead of Real Madrid even with all the current turmoil at the Bernabeu.\n\nBarca's lead would be larger but for draws against Deportivo La Coruna and Valencia after conceding late equalisers in their previous two La Liga games.\n\nLuis Enrique warned his players not to relax against 12th placed Betis, who have lost on each of their last six visits to the Camp Nou, conceding 22 times and scoring just seven.\n\n\"The players know the importance of each La Liga game,\" he said. \"In the last games we have dropped points -- at Valencia were the better team and against Deportivo we relaxed. We know it will be a key game and we need to get the victory. We have the chance to move away from our rivals in the table. It will be an attractive game and is motivating for us.\"\n\nThe Asturian coach said he had not been surprised by Barca immediately releasing new youth team signing Sergi Guardiola -- of no relation to Pep -- when previous tweets the youngster had sent came to light.\n\n\"It did not surprise me,\" Luis Enrique added. \"There were other similar cases recently.

And it's entirely free of Chelsea players.\n\nThe Premier League is at the halfway mark along with the rest of Europe's top leagues, meaning that it's time to ask Iain Macintosh for his Best XI of the season so far. Note: We reckon few people would have picked this team a few months ago ...\n\nGK: Jack Butland, Stoke City\n\nThere are more glamorous players at Stoke City these days -- Bojan, Xherdan Shaqiri, Marko Arnautovic -- but none are more crucial to the club's progress than Butland. Without his heroics, their tenuous steps towards a new, more expansive style of play might have been compromised by a relegation battle. The 22-year-old England stopper has waited patiently for his chance in the first team and like so many goal-bound shots, he's taken it with both hands.\n\nRB: Hector Bellerin, Arsenal\n\nEveryone knew that Bellerin was quick. In fact, tests at the training ground even proved that he was quicker even than Theo Walcott. Everyone knew too that he could be a potent threat as an attacking full-back; what was up for debate was how much use he'd be when he needed to defend. But towards the end of last season, the former Barcelona trainee began to step up and he's continued to improve all year.\n\nCB: Chris Smalling, Man United\n\nThere haven't been many positives for Manchester United supporters this season, but the fact that Smalling has finally achieved his potential is a tiny bit of compensation for all the mediocrity elsewhere. In the past, Smalling hasn't always looked as if even he believed that he should be playing for United, but that's changed this season. He carries himself differently, he's more confident in the challenge. It's just a shame about everyone else.\n\nCB: Toby Alderweireld, Tottenham\n\nIt can often be difficult for centre-backs to settle quickly into new teams -- just look at Dejan Lovren's struggles since moving to Liverpool. But Alderweireld hasn't had any problem adjusting to life at White Hart Lane. Alongside Jan Vertonghen, he's helping to forge one of the most tight-fisted defences in the league. All this and he's only 26 years old. It is most unlike Tottenham to make such astute purchases.\n\nLB: Nacho Monreal, Arsenal\n\nAnother Arsenal player to have suddenly bloomed this year, the sight of Nacho Monreal on the overlap galloping down the left flank and cutting back a low, first-time cross has delighted Arsenal's supporters all season. He and Bellerin have the energy and the intelligence to push up at the right time, giving Arsenal extra width and allowing them to overwhelm their opponents.\n\nThe Exploding Heads break down the upcoming Boxing Day fixtures.\n\nRM: Riyad Mahrez, Leicester City\n\nAnother huge success for the Leicester City recruitment team, Mahrez signed in 2014 for a fee of approximately \u00a3400,000. He's worth at least 50 times that now. It was clear last season that he had some talent and creativity but he lacked the consistency and strength that he's added to his game this year. Now he looks unstoppable. He's a problem that few defences can solve and it's little wonder that clubs like Manchester United and Chelsea have been linked with him in recent months.\n\nMC: N'Golo Kante, Leicester City\n\nWhoever found Kante deserves some kind of scouting medal. He had played just one season in the French top flight, finishing 13th with Caen, but Leicester saw enough, spent just over \u00a35 million and bought themselves one of the players of the season. It's tempting to describe Kante as a guard dog: small, mobile, relentless and quite terrifying. But he can pass too. He's some player.\n\nMC: Eric Dier, Tottenham\n\nThere were murmurings of discontent when Tottenham began the season with Dier in midfield. Surely a side with Champions League ambitions would want more than a refitted defender in such a crucial position? But Dier, it seems, is much more than a refitted defender. He's an intelligent, adept and considered footballer who brings a solidity that enables Spurs' more creative players to thrive.\n\nOzil has a remarkable 15 assists in the league so far this season, more than double the next-best player.\n\nLM: Mesut Ozil, Arsenal\n\nNo, he's not a left winger, but can you imagine the state of the comments box if we left Ozil out because we wanted two strikers? This is the year that the German playmaker has shown the full extent of his powers. He has been magnificent for Arsenal, playing in the No. 10 role and devastating the opposition. If he plays in the second half of the season as he has in the first, Arsenal may yet win the title and Ozil will be a front-runner for the player of the year awards.\n\nST: Jamie Vardy, Leicester City\n\nVardy is a legitimate phenomenon, a lower league hotshot turned international hitman. He's jet-heeled, cold-blooded and has the stamina of a horse. Vardy never, ever gives up. He snaps at everything, leaving defenders anxious and unsettled. Having been released into the badlands of non-league football, he could never have expected to return to the top flight. But to return and lead the English top flight's goal-scoring charts, breaking records along the way, is as incredible as it is implausible.\n\nST: Romelu Lukaku, Everton\n\nEveryone has known about Lukaku's potential for years. What we didn't know was whether or not he could achieve it. We know now. He has always been a clever and powerful forward, but he's added composure and ruthlessness to his game now. His first touch has improved and experience has taught him when to hesitate and assess, and when to open fire. Everton need to do the same, or they will have to fight to keep him.\n\nIain Macintosh is a writer for ESPN FC and editor of @thesetpieces.

As always, Transfer Talk has the latest and greatest. See all the summer deals here.\n\nTOP STORY: Barca desperate to keep Neymar, Messi from Prem\n\nSpanish football could be in big trouble if the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo depart for the riches of the Premier League, according to La Liga (LFP) president Javier Tebas.\n\nTebas told Cadena Ser that the departures of the Barcelona and Real Madrid stars would seriously damage future TV rights deals for the Primera Division, and ensure the dominance of the Premier League: \"We must try to hold on to [Messi and Ronaldo]. It would not be a problem right away if they leave, because we have sold the rights for the next three seasons, but it would have an effect from there on.\"\n\nWith that in mind, Barcelona are set to offer Neymar a deal which would see the Brazil star's wages rocket from \u20ac10.5 million net a year to \u20ac30m, according to Marca -- a huge increase considering the Camp Nou club's financial constraints, but it's certainly worth it to keep the likes of Manchester United and City at bay next summer. However, Sport reports that City are preparing a monster offer for Messi for around \u20ac27m net a season. That's the problem with having stars is that everybody else wants to reach for them.\n\nMeanwhile, Sport reports that Arsenal could also be after Barca youngster Sergi Samper and are considering a \u20ac6m January bid for the highly rated La Masia graduate, while North London rivals Tottenham want Sandro from the Camp Nou.\n\nCesc bruised by Blues' boos\n\nCesc Fabregas' Chelsea future is still in serious doubt with plenty at Stamford Bridge blaming the Spanish midfielder as one of the chief culprits behind Jose Mourinho's exit earlier in December. Having also been forced out of Barcelona after attracting the supporters' ire, Fabregas could be on the move again as Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport reports that Inter Milan and Serie A champions Juventus will battle for the 28-year-old's signature.\n\nElsewhere, Loic Remy's time at Chelsea has mainly been one of frustration, with Mourinho refusing to trust the French forward even as the Premier League champions' season has come crashing down around them, and the Mirror reports that Aston Villa are keen on a loan deal for the 28-year-old to try and avoid their wholly foreseeable relegation.\n\nWith Diego Costa suspended and both Remy and Radamel Falcao injured, Guus Hiddink was reduced to playing Eden Hazard as a false No. 9 in Monday's stalemate at Manchester United -- but Patrick Bamford could come to the Blues' rescue in January after declaring he will end his \"terrible\" loan spell at Crystal Palace prematurely.\n\nCesc Fabregas is in the crosshairs of angry Chelsea fans.\n\nAtleti eye Ighalo\n\nThe trouble with this topsy-turvy Premier League season is that with so many surprise packages before the January transfer window, a number of clubs on the rise may struggle to keep hold of their top players. Odion Ighalo notched his 14th goal of the campaign for Watford against Tottenham on Monday, though a 2-1 defeat to Spurs may just cause the striker to quietly consider his options.\n\nThe Mirror reports that with Jackson Martinez struggling following a big-money move from Porto in the summer, Atletico Madrid are looking at making a \u00a312m bid for the 26-year-old Nigeria international at the end of the season. Watford fans and neutrals alike will likely say that the forward would be foolish to move on when he's in such fine form and with the Hornets on the rise. But a club of Atleti's calibre doesn't always come knocking. Still, it's hard to see Quique Sanchez Flores letting his star man go for such a low fee. Atleti might have to double that original offer and add another \u00a310m at the rate Ighalo is racking up the goals.\n\nUnited starlet back to save Van Gaal?\n\nAdnan Januzaj is one of the many attackers Louis van Gaal deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford this summer, but the young Belgian could be on his way back to Manchester United after The Sun reported that he was in the stands for Monday's game against Chelsea.\n\nThe 20-year-old -- currently on loan with Borussia Dortmund, who are in their winter break -- was pictured sitting alongside the injured youngster Jesse Lingard. But whether it was just a brief visit back to Manchester or something more remains to be seen given his lack of playing time at BVB. Considering he scored in his final appearance before a Bundesliga loan move, Van Gaal might well welcome the winger back with open arms.\n\nFormer Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will of course want to see United keep falling short, but has given Van Gaal advice that practically every Red Devils fan is screaming out: sign a striker. The LA Galaxy midfielder told BT Sport: \"I think they need an extra striker because there's still too much pressure on Wayne Rooney.\"\n\nCould Adnan Januzaj be United's saviour up front?\n\nArsenal to can Campbell for Nolito?\n\nArsene Wenger challenged Joel Campbell to take his chance at Arsenal this season, and the Costa Rica international has grabbed it with both hands to help the Gunners to the top of the Premier League and through to the Champions League last 16. But even though the 23-year-old has impressed on the right flank, The Sun reports that Wenger is tempted to use him as bait to land Celta Vigo star Nolito.\n\nThe paper says Arsenal \"face stiff competition\" from Barcelona for the 29-year-old Celta winger, who has hit eight La Liga goals this season, though the Gunners have reportedly held initial talks over a potential deal which could involve Campbell heading to Spain. Further back in Wenger's formation, sources told ESPN FC on Sunday that Arsenal were in talks with Basel over a move for Egypt midfielder Mohamed Elneny, and the Mail reports that the 23-year-old defensive midfielder will have a medical in Paris on Tuesday ahead of a \u00a37.4m move.\n\nEuro no-go for Pirlo; Zlatan open to Qatar\n\nAnd now for two legends of the modern game: Andrea Pirlo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. First up, Italy and New York City FC magician Pirlo has vowed to see out his contract with NYCFC and not return to Europe this winter, as he is confident that he can convince Italy coach Antonio Conte to pick him for Euro 2016 without the need for a loan move. He told La Gazzetta dello Sport: \"Lots of clubs have enquired about me, but I have a contract with New York City [until December 2016] and I want to respect it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain talisman Ibrahimovic has not ruled out a move to Qatar -- conveniently the home of his club's owners -- when his contract with the French champions expires in the summer. The forward told L'Equipe: \"To play in Qatar? I have a good relationship with [PSG chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi] and with the people of Qatar but I can't say anything. Let's just say that it's a possibility.\"\n\nTap-ins\n\n- Easy come, easy go ... Sergi Guardiola (no relation to Pep) thought he had got a move to Barcelona on Monday after signing a deal with the Blaugrana, but the Camp Nou giants terminated the contract of the 24-year-old midfielder just hours after he signed because of a series of \"offensive\" tweets.\n\n- Breathe easy, West Ham fans ... co-chairman David Gold has revealed the club were \"two hours\" away from getting Rafa Benitez until Real Madrid jumped in. Los Blancos fans may now wish the club were as late to that deal as they were for David De Gea.\n\n- Harry Kane is leading Tottenham's charge for Champions League football, and coach Mauricio Pochettino says there is \"no price\" that Spurs would consider selling the England striker for.\n\n- Pablo Daniel Osvaldo could be set for a return to Serie A after his proposed transfer to Boca Juniors broke down, with the Porto striker's agent confirming two offers from Italy are on the table.", "Twists set up thrilling title race": "ESPN FC's Gab Marcotti discusses this weekend's Serie A action as Inter Milan lose and Juventus continue to climb the table.\n\nNot even Mario Kart provides as many twists and turns, thrills and spills as Serie A this season. There have been four different leaders, all of whom (probably with the exception of Roma) continue to believe they can win the Scudetto. Remarkably yet to take pole position but driving themselves back into serious contention are Juventus, the reigning champions who after a stalled start, are now flying up the standings.\n\nIt is compelling for the emotions as it is stirring -- Inter made their best start since 1966; Fiorentina went top for the first time since 1999; Napoli did too at the end of November for the first time in quarter of a century -- and that has made this title race too close to call. It's all so very exciting and hopes are high for a climax to rival the fairytale of '85 or the final day drama of 2002.\n\nBest player: Gonzalo Higuain\n\nRoberto Mancini put it best after watching Napoli's Higuain hammer his Inter side in a 2-1 win in late November: \"In Italy Higuain is like [Lionel] Messi in Spain and the Champions League. In Serie A there's him and then there's the rest... behind him. He scores once or twice a game and can be decisive with every touch he makes.\"\n\nCapocannoniere (Serie A's lead goal scorer) with 16 goals in 17 games, the Argentine has a point to prove after last season at Napoli and disappointments in World Cup and Copa America finals. As the best player in Italy, he has the ability to be the hinge on which the balance of power swings. His understanding with the excellent Lorenzo Insigne is so telepathic it's like they're one and the same player: \"HiguaInsigne.\"\n\nEdin Dzeko has scored three Serie A goals in 15 appearances this season.\n\nMost disappointing player: Edin Dzeko\n\nA harsh assessment when you consider Dzeko has scored in wins against champions Juventus, the derby with Lazio and away in Barcelona, but remember the Bosnia and Herzegovina international was supposed to be to this Roma team what Gabriel Batistuta was to the 2000-01 vintage that last claimed the Scudetto.\n\nMore renowned for his misses than his goals, of which he has scored just three in the league, fans have taken to calling him \"Edin Cieco.\" (\"Cieco\" means blind in Italian.) The former Manchester City striker hasn't quite flopped like Juventus' Hernanes nor Mario Suarez -- for whom Fiorentina paid Atletico Madrid \u20ac15 million in the summer -- but more was expected from him; as is the case with Geoffrey Kondogbia, who signed for Inter from Monaco for \u20ac30m in July.\n\nBest signing: Miranda\n\nNot since Walter Samuel and Lucio left have Inter had as authoritative a defender as Miranda. A backline that ranked ninth in Serie A last season is now the best. It must be said, credit for that is also due to goalkeeper Samir Handanovic and centre-back partner Jeison Murillo, but Brazil international Miranda has been outstanding. Eleven clean sheets tells a story.\n\nElsewhere, the bargain of the season has to be the \u20ac5.5m Fiorentina paid Europa League runners' up Dnipro for striker Nikola Kalinic. He has already scored 10 goals in Serie A. Then consider the business Torino did for Daniele Baselli. A \u20ac4.5m signing from Atalanta, the 23-year-old midfielder scored in the opening three games of the season and finally looks like fulfilling his potential. How Milan must rue not buying him when they could. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Paulo Dybala is living up to the hype that comes with costing \u20ac40m from Palermo and has admirably dealt with the pressure of replacing Carlos Tevez at Juve.\n\nBiggest surprise: Where do we begin?\n\nAs a team, the most obvious one is Fiorentina. Few believed they could improve on three consecutive fourth place finishes after Vincenzo Montella was sacked, Paulo Sousa hired and the wage bill slashed by 30 percent. But they have. In Reggio Emilia, Sassuolo continue to get better and better every year under Eusebio Di Francesco. Atalanta have never had as many points at this stage of a season since three points were introduced for a win two decades ago. Marten de Roon, signed for \u20ac1.3m from Heerenveen, has been an absolute revelation in midfield. But take a look at Empoli! Somehow despite losing their guru Maurizio Sarri, star defender Daniele Rugani and playmaker Mirko Valdifiori, they have gone to another level. Riccardo Saponara, in particular, has been brilliant.\n\nBest goal: Marco Benassi -- Torino 2-1 Palermo, Sept. 27, 2015\n\nA volleyed finish from an acute angle reminiscent of Marco van Basten's goal for Netherlands in the final of Euro '88 against the Soviet Union. Torino's Benassi no longer goes by his old name. He is now known as \"Marco van Benassi.\" \"I had to decide whether to bring it down or shoot. I opted for the latter and it came off. It all happened in a fraction of a second,\" he said.\n\nGonzalo Higuain scored twice as Napoli defeated Inter Milan.\n\nBest game: Napoli 2-1 Inter, Nov. 30, 2015\n\nEven if the temptation is to bring up the Maccarone-Lasagna derby between Empoli and Carpi, it really can only be Napoli-Inter: A top-of-the-table clash that produced another twist in the title race. Napoli overtook Inter and seized pole position at this stage of the season for the first time since their last Scudetto a quarter of a century ago. Higuain put them in front after 64 seconds. Inter were then reduced to 10 men before the interval and looked down and out when Higuain doubled Napoli's advantage shortly after the hour mark. But Inter then scared the hell out of their hosts as Adem Ljajic pulled one back before Steven Jovetic and Miranda then hit the post within seconds of each other in stoppage time. Were it not for a save-of-the-season contender from goalkeeper Pepe Reina it would have been the honours even. A classic game, it left both believing they have what it takes to win the Scudetto.\n\nPrediction for the rest of the season: A thrilling finish\n\nRomantics would love to see Napoli win the title for the first time since the days of Maradona. They've played the best football so far this season and possess the league's best player. It would be refreshing for the Scudetto to move away from Turin and Milan, its residence since 2002 when Roma relinquished it, and many of the realists are forecasting a re-run of that thrilling season.\n\nJuventus were six points behind Inter at Christmas then overtook them in dramatic circumstances on the final day. The gap is now down to three and it would provide an unpredictable season with a predictable finish -- Juventus' fifth straight title -- only, unlike the others, this would by no means be boring.\n\nRetaining their title after making their worst start in 103 years would be an incredible achievement for the Old Lady. And belief is growing not least because Inter, Roma and Napoli all have to go to the Juventus Stadium in 2016. However, irrespective of Sunday's 2-1 defeat to Lazio -- when Felipe Melo conceded a penalty and was sent off -- Inter look resilient. Dogged in defence, a spluttering attack is beginning to fire and Roberto Mancini's track record speaks for itself. He has been there and done it before and Inter haven't posted numbers like these since they won the Treble in 2010.\n\nJames Horncastle contributes to ESPN, BBC Sport, Guardian Football Weekly, FourFourTwo and The Blizzard.

Amid the scandal and arrests that have plagued FIFA over the last seven months, he is steadfast in his belief that he is the man to lead it out of the crisis, and that the rest of the soccer world is ready for the style and substance of his leadership.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nESPN FC: This concept of a 40-team World Cup -- do you think this is a good idea?\n\nThe idea of having an increase to the World Cup is fine. If I take it from our confederations point of view, for example, you have these half-slots which are a big problem. In Jordan, in the last World Cup, we had a playoff against Uruguay. Logistically, it was a nightmare. But you have to make things practical for the teams that qualify. There is an improvement in the level of the World Cup finalists, so there's an opportunity to work.\n\nBut my real issue with this -- and this came up in the last election, where they had decided in the ExCo [Executive Committee] that the next day they will discuss increases or decreases or what have you -- is they used it as a political tool. We know from now that this will not apply to the next two World Cups, so we're talking about 2026. My concern is, why is this being used as a political tool to gain votes and so on? It's just irresponsible in my opinion. It's completely irresponsible, and they tried to put it in the reform committee proposals, which again has absolutely nothing to do with that. It's a technical issue, and I hope that culture changes. It's total irresponsibility to even be alluding, discussing or promising these sort of things.\n\nPrince Ali Bin Al Hussein is one of five declared candidates in the FIFA presidential election, which will take place Feb. 26, 2016.\n\nSo philosophically, you're OK with expanding the number of slots?\n\nSure.\n\nYou just don't like the way FIFA has gone about trying to implement it?\n\nI don't think it has anything to do with the World Cup. But if you have proper change, and the culture of FIFA will bring all the stakeholders in, and really have a discussion about how to expand, then we do. But again, it's a matter of responsibility, and it's a shame that that took place, as well as the idea of expanding the ExCo the way that they have. Something is wrong. It's now up to 40. Maybe it's fine, maybe it's right, maybe it's fair. But it's not what our priority should be right now, which is really restructuring the organization itself and making it an effective body.\n\nThree of CONCACAF's presidents have been arrested. Do you think the Confederation of North and Central American and Caribbean Football is capable of reforming itself?\n\nI think so. You've got a lot of good people in football, and I would hope so. But look, I don't know too much about what has happened in CONCACAF in the past, so it's difficult for me to comment on that. But it is a step to getting things sorted out. But in February, and you have an election, and if you don't get the right candidate in, it will be a justification -- not just in CONCACAF, but all across the world -- that you've chosen the wrong path for the future. That's the critical issue.\n\nCONCACAF president Alfredo Hawit, left, was arrested on Dec. 3.\n\nDo you think the Copa America Centenario should go ahead in light of everything that's happened?\n\nI would hope so. You don't kill tournaments because of these people, but you've got to make it happen in the right way. One of the things with FIFA and down to confederations -- and I had this also in Asia -- the idea of having a no-bid process is wrong. You have to have transparency in a proper way. At the end of the day, all you are doing is taking away from football itself. The development of the game, from club level to league level to national team level, it's a shame. That's the real pity.\n\nWhat did you make of the arrests last week?\n\nI think it's a shame for football, a real shame that we're going through this process. And I don't think it's the end. The point is we have the responsibility to our players, our fans, all stakeholders and the fact that this has been going on is incredible. We lost an opportunity. We wasted a year since the last election just going through this process. Lots of things could have been different than what they are right now, and that's why I'm determined to finish this.\n\nSepp Blatter is on his way out, but the constituency that elected him is still in place. Why can you prevail under those circumstances?\n\nI'm not concerned with anything that has happened in the past. I'm looking to the future. And to be honest, I come from a unique situation where I am a national association president. I'm one of these guys, and I believe that we can change it from within. I'm pushing away the past and I'm focusing on the future. I think that worldwide, that's the real desire for our FAs [football associations]. If you can do it at that level, I'm very confident that people will be happy across the world and move in the same direction down to the national association levels.\n\nHow optimistic are you that the FIFA reforms announced last week by Francois Carrard will even be approved? In the past, there's been an impetus to make changes, but when it actually came time to implement them, FIFA blinked.\n\nI honestly do believe that it's not about what is approved or not approved. It is about implementation. And you have to have people who will work full time to make sure that things are going in the right way, including the president. It's always been about implementation. Always. It's not window dressing, but real implementation.\n\nDo you think the current reforms go far enough? There are no age limits, and while some committees will have independent members, do you think the new FIFA council should have had independent voices as well?\n\nWhen I came into the FIFA ExCo, my impression, or my idea of being on the ExCo was to be a check and balance for the system and the president himself. I operated in that way. It's a bit of an interesting situation where you are enlarging this group but also taking away some of its power. And a lot of the abuse that happened in the ExCo, whether anybody likes it or not, came from the president's office himself. Either he knew about things, and if he didn't, that's a bad leader. So it's an interesting outlook to have.\n\nAs for the reforms, I disagree with a three-term limit. I disagree with an age limit in the first place. In a lot of places, that's a form of prejudice. If you're old enough or young enough and healthy enough to do the job, that's fine. But I think a two-term limit for the president and the executive is enough. That should be the case. Right now they have a three-term limit that starts in three years. And if you've been there for 20 years, you can continue for another 17 or 15 years. It's not where it should be.\n\nSo the reforms laid out by Mr. Carrard, the reforms that they are proposing, are you in favor of that?\n\nThere's a lot of good things out there. There are a lot of good things from the [Domenico] Scala recommendations as well. There are a lot of good things from Mark Pieth. But again, it's about implantation. That's the important thing. I think Carrard's committee is composed of confederations, people who come from the ExCo. Hey, they moved in a certain direction, but is it simply reactionary for the moment, or is it a reality for the future? If you have a strong leadership and a change of culture in FIFA, it's the only way you'll move things forward. I've seen it so many times, the promise of something and they don't deliver.\n\nJeff Carlisle covers MLS and the U.S. national team for ESPN FC.

In weighing the light and dark sides from all the films, we found a proper balance of the Force in a 4-2-3-1 system that abides by key Star Wars rules such as not having more than two Sith on the same side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE LINEUP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCOUTING REPORT\n\n\n\n\n\nGrand Moff Tarkin: Manager\n\nHome Planet: Eriadu\n\nIn Tarkin, you have the key attributes to being a ruthless, effective manager. He makes decisions without becoming entangled in petty emotions (Is that your home planet of Alderaan, Princess Leia? Kaboom!). He has experience keeping Sith such as Vader on their leash and not being intimidated by big egos. He runs the club, Fergie-style, and when the going gets tough, he's not a manager to bail for another club. Remember, this man refused an escape ship when the Death Star was under siege.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChewbacca: Goalkeeper\n\nHome Planet: Kashyyyk\n\nBest Skill: Aerial Dominance\n\nEasy choice, this is. Chewie has the height, strength and wingspan to stop pretty much everything. He's basically Sunderland's Costel Pantilimon with more hair. Plus, he maintains that all-important keeper trait: He's a bit crazy, but in a good way -- a player who won't hesitate to bark at his central defense if it loses concentration. Sure, you have to worry about the Wookiee's propensity to pull opponents' arms out of their sockets if he loses, but Chewbacca will put everyone this side of David de Gea to shame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDarth Vader: Center Back\n\nHome Planet: Tatooine\n\nBest Skill: The Reducer\n\nYou need an imposing veteran at the back who makes sure everyone's positioning is correct and intimidates opponents by his sheer presence. Enter the original galactic gangster, Darth Vader. A sort of John Terry in a cape and helmet, you won't find anyone better at the dark arts of soccer. Need to take someone down before he's clear on goal? No moral qualms here. And if anyone manages to get in behind, Vader can execute an invisible choke hold, and the ref will be none the wiser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKylo Ren: Center Back\n\nHome Planet: Unknown\n\nBest Skill: Force Push Block\n\nWho better to partner with Lord Vader than Kylo Ren, the man who vows in the \"The Force Awakens\" trailer: \"Nothing will stand in our way. I will finish what you started.\" Kylo Ren demonstrates a dangerous side -- he's reportedly hell-bent on destroying the last of the Jedi -- with an ability to get his hands dirty, supposedly having built his own lightsaber. What he lacks in Vader-esque experience, he makes up for in maniacal, power-hungry drive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoba Fett: Left Back\n\nHome Planet: Kamino\n\nBest Skill: Jet-Fueled Raids Down The Flank\n\nThis badass bounty hunter's jet pack allows him to blast up and down the flank -- imagine a more calculating, turbo-charged Luke Shaw -- making him all but impossible to mark in attack and catch out of position defensively. Boba Fett barely says a word, so you won't have to worry about him getting yellow carded for dissent, while his armor protects him from any dirty challenges. And let's face it: All sides need a cult antihero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoe Dameron: Right Back\n\nHome Planet: Yavin IV (rumored)\n\nBest Skill: Pinpoint Crosses\n\nConsider Poe the Wedge Antilles of \"The Force Awakens\" -- he's not the star of the show, but the ace X-Wing pilot and a leader of the Resistance against the First Order will have the intellect and battle-hardened nerves to protect and attack down the right flank without grandstanding or demanding a big contract after every season. He is, in short, the galaxy's Pablo Zabaleta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi: Defensive Midfielder\n\nHome Planet: Stewjon\n\nBest Skill: Arguing With Refs\n\nObi-Wan's worldview is key to his position. \"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view,\" he famously said in \"Return of the Jedi.\" Indeed, Obi-Wan intuitively understands soccer's moral relativism, the kind you need to be a little naughty in the defensive midfield. Obi-Wan can also defend his teammates: \"This isn't the player you're looking for,\" he says as he effortlessly waves his hand in front of the match official, before pointing an incriminating finger toward Diego Costa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Phasma: Defensive Midfielder\n\nHome Planet: Unknown\n\nBest Skill: Late Tackling\n\nTo excel as a defensive midfielder, you need a nasty streak -- think Javier Mascherano, who never gives up in chasing balls or pulls out of a tackle. Enter First Order loyalist Captain Phasma. We don't know much about this uber-stormtrooper yet, but we know enough. Phasma commands the First Order's legions of troopers and is said to be ruthless. In short, she can help provide direction in the midfield and take anyone out at any time when there's a need to break up a counterattack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuke Skywalker: Attacking Midfielder, Central\n\nHome Planet: Tatooine\n\nBest Skill: Killer Assists\n\nYour No. 10 between the two attacking midfielders, Skywalker will create chances in front of goal and open up space for others. It's a selfless trait Luke revealed when he travelled to Bespin to rescue Han Solo and Princess Leia. Of course, that happened after Luke disobeyed Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, again showing the young Jedi's impulsive nature. Suffice to say, Louis van Gaal would hate Skywalker's reckless nature. His tendency to daydream could also earn him the reputation of being the galaxy's Mesut Ozil, but when focused, Skywalker makes unlocking defenses look as easy as sniping womp rats from his trusty T-16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincess Leia Organa: Attacking Midfielder, Left\n\nHome Planet: Alderaan\n\nBest Skill: Bending It Like Beckham\n\nWith her ESP-like connection to her brother, Luke, Leia is always a step ahead of the opposition. It's the perfect tandem: Luke opens up space, and Leia runs into it seamlessly and without so much as a wink to alert defenders. Leia also brings more organizational smarts to the attack, and she isn't afraid to take her teammates to task if they get too big for their boots. You can already hear her telling Han Solo, after another failed long-range attempt, \"I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHan Solo: Attacking Midfielder, Right\n\nHome Planet: Corellia\n\nBest Skill: Shots From Distance\n\nEvery side needs that player -- the scruffy-looking solo artist who guns for glory and never sees a shot that's not worth taking. Han Solo brings little subtlety to his attacking role. In this intergalactic soccer world, he always shoots first (sorry, Greedo) and exhibits enough street smarts to get into the heads of opponents with his blunt trash talking. Think of him as a combination Arjen Robben and Diego Costa, only likable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoda: Striker\n\nHome Planets: Coruscant And Dagobah\n\nBest Skill: Swirling Bicycle Kick\n\nLet's be clear: We're talking about Yoda from \"Attack of the Clones\" and \"Revenge of the Sith,\" the little green menace who battled Count Dooku and the Emperor with such blinding speed you could only keep track of his movements thanks to his green lightsaber. This Yoda is the perfect player to run in behind defenses before they even know he's there, weave in between central defenders and jump high to get on the end of any cross on set plays. Many goals, Yoda will score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Liverpool must raise game against Sunderland": "Former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol thinks Liverpool will beat Sunderland but has concerns about their attack.\n\nHaving beaten league leaders Leicester City 1-0 on Boxing Day, Liverpool now face a challenge of an entirely different kind as they travel to the Northeast to take on struggling Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on Wednesday.\n\nSam Allardyce's side currently lie second from the bottom in the Premier League yet for Liverpool this is arguably a more difficult test than Leicester, as this is the type of fixture and style of opponent that they often have the most trouble with. This season the Merseysiders have won at Chelsea and Manchester City, drawn at Arsenal, Spurs and Everton, yet meekly surrendered at Newcastle before being humiliated at Watford.\n\nThe better the opponent the better Liverpool seem to play, but too often they've failed to show up against the so-called \"lesser sides\" and that needs to change if they are going to capitalise on the ongoing struggles of some of their top-four rivals.\n\nSunderland Sunderland Liverpool Liverpool 7:45 PM UTC Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nLiverpool have a great chance to get back into the Champions League this season and it's imperative they take it, because it surely won't be as wide open next year. Chelsea and Manchester United are unlikely to struggle this badly again so Jurgen Klopp's men need to take advantage. That means they cannot afford many more slipups in fixtures they should win, starting Wednesday.\n\nLiverpool's stuttering form during recent weeks has prevented them from being up there in the thick of it at the top of the table. Picking up nine points from games against Newcastle, West Brom and Watford didn't seem like too much to expect after the Reds had put six past Southampton in the Capital One Cup. Had they done so they'd now be level on points with third-placed Spurs. Instead they took just one point from nine and currently sit in 10th.\n\nThe league is so tight this year that every point is crucial and although Liverpool got back on track by beating Leicester, the sense of frustration at those setbacks in the three previous fixtures will linger for a while yet, especially if more points are dropped against Sunderland.\n\nThe inconsistency of others means the damage from those slip-ups has not been as severe as it could have been but you have to assume that eventually the stronger sides in the league will find their form. Unless Liverpool can find some consistency of their own, they will be left behind.\n\nThe game Wednesday sees the Reds reunited with two former players, Sebastian Coates and Fabio Borini, and Borini spoke this week of how he wants to score against Liverpool \"more than anyone else.\" Given Liverpool's vulnerability on set-pieces it's the towering Coates who may pose the bigger threat than the less than prolific Italian. Indeed, the only thing for Kopites to fear from Borini is that football invariably throws up these scenarios whereby players often seem to score against clubs that had cast them aside.\n\nLiverpool also have two players coming up against their former employers of course, and the game will mean a lot to Jordan Henderson in particular. While goalkeeper Simon Mignolet spent three seasons at the Stadium of Light and will be eager to impress, for Henderson it's extra special as he's a local lad who grew up supporting Sunderland and lived the dream by coming through their academy system to eventually become a first-team regular.\n\nJurgen Klopp has spoken of the need for consistency at Liverpool.\n\nEven though he's very much a Liverpool player now, he's never forgotten his roots and his boyhood club is still close to his heart. He even sat among Sunderland supporters at Wembley to cheer his former team on when they narrowly lost to Manchester City in the Capital One Cup Final in 2013. It's understandable he remains a popular figure with Sunderland fans.\n\nWhile Borini may be itching to score against his former employers, Henderson's only concern will be picking up three points for Liverpool and then hoping to see Sunderland climb the table during the next few months. There will certainly be no celebration if he finds the net.\n\nLiverpool supporters won't care where the goals come from, just as long as they come. Having found the net just 21 times in 18 games, goal scoring continues to be the biggest problem for the Reds as they try to nurse Daniel Sturridge back to full fitness.\n\nThey were not helped by Divock Origi picking up a hamstring injury against Leicester. That was most untimely as the young Belgian has shown some flashes of form during the past month. He brings pace and a willingness to work the channels that simply isn't there when Christian Benteke or Roberto Firmino are leading the line. Without him, Klopp will surely have to turn to Benteke now, even though it's been clear recently that the German isn't exactly enamoured with what the big striker has been serving.\n\nIt's been a difficult period for Benteke, who has not really adapted to Liverpool's style under Klopp or his predecessor Brendan Rodgers, but at least he has continued to find the net on a fairly regular basis. Five goals from 15 games (only 10 of them starts) is not a bad return for a frontman still trying to fit into his new surroundings and a style of play he is not accustomed to.\n\nSunderland don't score many either (just 19 goals), and only Swansea, Aston Villa and West Brom have scored fewer this season, so the likelihood is that this will be another close, low-scoring game, possibly settled by a mistake or a set piece. Liverpool should be used to that by now though, as barring a handful of exceptions, it's been that way all season for them.\n\nDave Usher is the founder/editor of the popular LFC fanzine and website The Liverpool Way.

There needs to be revitalization and changes.\n\n\"But now with the elections, things are open. I have to say in all openness, my position has not changed.\"\n\nMr Lim Kia Tong, FAS vice-president went on to confirm that Singapore football is set to conduct their first-ever presidential election next year, but will need to amend the current constitution after FIFA informed the FAS in September to hold back internal elections of a new council, which includes the president and deputy president.\n\nHas Singapore football improved in 2015? Yes, Singapore football is on the up No, We are going backwards 23% Yes, Singapore football is on the up\n\n77% No, We are going backwards\n\nThe previous FAS president has traditionally been a political figure, and this is not in compliance with FIFA's statures of the sport.\n\nFIFA's directives for the FAS is to ensure two aspects to be included in their constitution; that the term of office for council members will be four years rather than the current two years, and that all candidates are subjected to integrity checks prior to any elections.\n\n\"We need to amend our constitution first. Hopefully, we can get it done by March next year and if everything goes well, we should be holding our elections somewhere in June,\" said the vice-president.\n\nAnother major talking point at the AGM was the ASEAN Super League (ASL), a new regional tournament that was originally slated to kick off this year, only to be delayed till 2017.\n\nIn what was a strong statement of intent by Zainudin, the FAS boss confirmed that the ASL will definitely happen.\n\n\"ASL is something that is going to happen. This is a region of 600 million people crazy about football. The talent is huge but the jump from local [Southeast Asia] leagues to some of Asia's top leagues like the Japanese and Korean leagues is too big. And that is why we need to have a regional league to fill the vacuum for this. I think the ASL will be able to provide that.\n\n\"FIFA is currently finalizing the regulations of the competition and we are confident that the ASL will begin in 2017.\"\n\nHaving endured a lot of negative comments thrown his way in the past 12 months, since the Singapore national team and U23 outfit failed to make an impact at the AFF Suzuki Cup and Southeast Asian Games respectively, Zainudin put on a brave front and rallied Singaporeans to continue to show their support for local football.\n\n\"There have been a lot of views about Singapore football every day, every time, be it at coffee shops or in cyber space. We as stakeholders, we take the matter seriously. We understand and are logical and rational,\" Zainudin said.\n\n\"But sometimes, we get carried away with the views, but nevertheless, when we calmed down, we know that we are united and want to improve football.\n\n\"I always believe that I'm not the only person in FAS that is getting criticism. I imagine all my peers, colleagues and council members, we all feel sad when we get such criticism.\n\n\"To be fair, it is not easy. People out there will always measure you by the results on the pitch. They won't see what we do in the background but its ok. We need to be able to take it in our stride. I just hope people will look at the work we have done like the strategic plan ... we will continue to try and win you over. We believe but we need your help and your support. Let's work together to make 2016 an exciting one for Singapore football.\"\n\nIt will be a year of redemption for Singapore football as the emphasis will return to the S.League -- after LionsXII's abrupt exit from Malaysia football -- and the biennial AFF Suzuki Cup tournament held in the Philippines, where Singapore will be gunning for a fifth ASEAN crown.", "Atletico Madrid need more goals from strikers for title": "Fernando Torres hasn't scored in three months, and he's not the only Atletico Madrid striker struggling to find the back of the net.\n\nThursday's 1-0 victory over Reus in the Copa del Rey ensured Atletico Madrid made it 15 games without tasting defeat. It is a run that has seen them rack up 12 victories, nine of which coming consecutively, and keep the same amount of clean sheets. It is as impressive a stretch of games as any side in Europe has produced this season, and Atletico have catapulted themselves firmly into the title race.\n\nAvoid defeat at Malaga on Sunday, and Atletico will be sole leaders at the top of the La Liga table at Christmas. Nobody, not even the most optimistic of Los Colchoneros' fans, saw this coming.\n\nIt is a remarkable achievement for a side that, at the time of writing, are level with a Barcelona outfit containing Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar, and sit five points ahead of city rivals Real Madrid and their plethora of Galacticos.\n\nThis is something Atleti did not even manage to accomplish during the title-winning 2013-14 campaign, which just goes to show how far the side have come under Diego Simeone's stewardship. Despite rumours linking him to the vacancy at Chelsea, the question has to be asked: Why would he want to leave?\n\nHe is universally adored by the Vicente Calderon faithful, at a club he loves and enjoyed some of his best playing days. Just six months ago, Simeone penned a bumper new deal that keeps him tied to the club until 2020, and, to use a current footballing buzzword, has just embarked upon a new \"project\" on the banks of the Manzanares River. He is now reaping the fruits of his four years' worth of labour.\n\nAll this has been achieved without having any of their strikers -- Antoine Griezmann, who occupies the No. 10 role, aside -- in any sort of form. While fans have little to moan about after a nearly perfect first half of the season, it is the one cause for concern in the squad.\n\nAfter starting the season reasonably well, Fernando Torres has not found the back of the net for three months. His last goal came in the 2-0 victory away to Eibar on Sept. 16, and he appears no closer to bringing up his ton.\n\nIt is 16 appearances and counting since he hit goal No. 99 for Atleti in the Basque country, and truth be told, if it were not for his status as a club legend, some considerably sharp knives would be out for him. It is not for the want of chances, either. Torres has contrived to miss a number of sitters, not least two in the first period in midweek, and too often looked for the pass when well positioned to shoot.\n\n\"While he works as he does and gives what he does, both in training and games, I'm not worried about him not scoring his 100th goal,\" Simeone said after the Reus encounter. \"The goal will come. Fernando Torres has always scored big goals, and hopefully when he bags it, it will be one of those big goals. He trains with the group, he's involved with the club and the goal will come.\"\n\nWhile Simeone appreciates a player's work rate and miles covered as much as every Rojiblanco fan out there, the Argentine will know that if the side are to push on this season and capitalise on their terrific first half, then the millstone of goal No. 100 needs to be shed sooner rather than later. Right now, Torres is a passenger when he lines up.\n\nJackson Martinez is still feeling the effects of an ankle injury that has kept him sidelined for the past six weeks. However, he is yet another player who, despite promising much, needs to up his game. The Colombian has bagged just three goals since completing a \u20ac35 million move from Porto -- a paltry return that is nowhere near good enough.\n\nHe was signed to fill the void left by the departed Mario Mandzukic; however, the Croat had scored 14 in all competitions at this stage last year. Those are goals that have been sorely missed; Los Rojiblancos won a number of narrow victories that were harder work than they should have been, thanks to profligate finishing.\n\nLuciano Vietto's form has been patchy, but since he turned 22 last week, he can be excused -- despite the reported \u20ac20m transfer fee he commanded in the summer.\n\nTo his credit, the Argentine has looked more of the Villarreal striker who took La Liga by storm last year as of late. His two goals in his past three appearances makes him by far the club's in-form No. 9, which speaks volumes of the struggles his strike partners are experiencing. He should return to the XI for the trip to Andalusia this weekend and can hopefully build on his positive form.\n\nGriezmann has kept the side moving forward, and a watertight backline has helped maintain the side's current run. However, as the side prepare to embark on a shorter winter break than usual, the message should be simple: They need to score more.\n\nWith the looming threat of the January transfer window and the potential to sign replacements, hopefully Torres -- who, lest we forget only has six months left on his deal -- will bring up his century, Jackson will prove to be more than an expensive flop and Vietto will continue to develop with less expectation on his shoulders.\n\nIf not, Simeone might have to dip into the market for someone who can help fire the side to glory and help alleviate the pressure on Griezmann's shoulders.\n\nJoseph is a sports journalist based in the Spanish capital and covers Atletico Madrid regularly.

Claudio Ranieri's surprise package can leapfrog the Gunners if they beat Manchester City at the King Power Stadium, but whatever happens, Arsene Wenger's team are in a good position heading into the second half of the season.\n\nFor Arsenal to be where they are this campaign is both an expectation filled for fans who have demanded more in recent seasons and an achievement in itself because of the issues of depth that the squad has faced. The injury situation has been a hindrance, no doubt about it. For every bad performance, and you think of dropped points away at Norwich and West Brom as well as the recent defeat to Southampton, more options for the Arsenal manager might have altered the result. What if Arsenal had the ability to add some zip to midfield or some quality up front?\n\nIn the summer, there was dismay that a centre-forward wasn't brought in, but with 15 goals so far, Olivier Giroud has performed admirably. Theo Walcott's six pale in comparison, yet the England man is often given far more leeway from critics and fans. Joel Campbell has come in to play a decent cameo role, too. And the man who has driven Arsenal's season, Mesut Ozil, is worthy of all the attention he gets at the moment.\n\nArsenal Arsenal AFC Bournemouth AFC Bournemouth 2 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nHe now has 16 league assists for the season, and his goal against Bournemouth came from beautiful combination play between himself and Giroud. Some wondered if the pair were incompatible, with the German's preference for through balls to a pacey forward, but they've dovetailed wonderfully this season.\n\nOzil's creativity, his passing, his assists and all other the petals of his attacking flower are what catch the eye, but he probably doesn't get enough credit for the other aspects of his game. His languid style is probably a factor in this, but his work off the ball doesn't get anywhere near enough attention. Ever wonder why he has so much space around him when he receives the ball? It's because he's run there to find it.\n\nESPN FC's Steve Nicol sees Mesut Ozil breaking the Prem assist record but not necessarily winning the title.\n\nWatch him pick the ball up on one side of the pitch, then pop up on the other to help Arsenal maintain possession. He is the fulcrum through which the team operates, and you cannot do that without a huge physical effort in every game. He's not blood and guts; that's simply not his style. He's like a moving walkway in an airport, nonstop motion, just that little bit quicker over the ground than everyone else, with a sublime football intelligence so he knows exactly where he needs to be.\n\nIt's wonderful watching him create chances and make goals, but that doesn't come just because he can pass a football well. It's because he works exceptionally hard, and when players work hard they're often rewarded for it.\n\nIt's little wonder Wenger said after the Bournemouth game: \"What's important is that Ozil convinces everybody that he is not only a talented player but one who is ready to work for the team.\" His contribution so far has been immense. If he can maintain this level, and Arsenal can address the issues of squad depth, there no reason Ozil can't drive them to their first Premier League title since 2004.\n\nConsider that Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck and Tomas Rosicky haven't played a minute so far, while Mikel Arteta also has been plagued with a chronic calf problem. Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain have had spells on the sideline. The first-choice central midfield partnership of Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin fell to knee ligament injuries that will keep them out until well in 2016. And the effervescent Alexis Sanchez finally proved himself human when a hamstring strain sidelined him back in November.\n\nSo, while there are issues for Wenger to address in the short and medium term, for a small squad to be right up there at the top of the table is a testament to the quality of those who have played, and also to the character of a group that is too often accused of lacking that quality.\n\nIt's a long way from the table this time last year, when they sat 13 points behind leaders Chelsea with virtually no chance of challenging for the title. Regardless of how you frame what's happened so far this season, Arsenal are very much in the race for the Premier League.\n\nAndrew Mangan is owner and writer of the award-winning arseblog.com.

After almost a decade of toiling away in Spain with inconsistent Real Sociedad, one season at new club Barcelona was all it took for the Chilean to win his first La Liga title. Better still, his excellent league campaign was rewarded on an individual level, when he took home the Zamora Trophy for conceding the fewest goals in the Spanish top flight.\n\nTo top things off, the 32-year-old made history at international level in the summer, winning the Copa America on home soil in July. Playing every game in Chile's first ever trophy win, he was vital to their success in the final against Argentina, stopping a penalty in the decisive shootout.\n\nDespite all of those achievements, Bravo could still have one gripe about the last 12 months: he has missed out on a slice of Champions League glory, and all the recognition that comes with it. While Marc-Andre ter Stegen's role in their 2014-15 win saw him recognised with a spot in the Champions League Squad of the Season as well as the Save of the Season award, Bravo could only watch on while the Blaugrana returned to the top of the pile in club football's biggest competition. He would instead have to content himself with maintaining solid performance levels in the league, to lesser fanfare.\n\nThe last four months have produced two pivotal moments in Bravo and Ter Stegen's battle for Barca goalkeeping supremacy. The first arrived in September, when an injury to the older of the duo meant that the young German finally made his league debut for Barcelona, giving him a golden chance to seize the weekly starting position at the Camp Nou. He couldn't take advantage of his opportunity though, conceding in every one of his four league games in Bravo's absence, including a 4-1 loss to Celta Vigo that raised questions over just how ready Ter Stegen was to play every game at one of the toughest clubs in the world.\n\nThat meant a return to the status quo once Bravo was fit, with one keeper playing the cup games and the other the league, but in the last few weeks there has been a sign that the balance of power could now shift once more. When Barcelona travelled to Japan for the Club World Cup, Ter Stegen would have expected to start just as he had done in every other knockout tournament since arriving in Catalonia. Instead, Luis Enrique put his faith in Bravo, picking him in both of Barca's games while the younger keeper observed unhappily from the bench.\n\nThe Asturian's decision was rewarded with a sum of zero goals conceded by his team; Bravo consistently solid over 180 minutes. In the 3-0 final win against River Plate he was particularly outstanding, proving alert when called upon sporadically in the first half, before producing an exhibition of tricky saves in the dying minutes as River looked for a consolation goal. First, he showed astonishing agility to leap high and tip a powerful Lucas Alario header over the bar. Then, he went one better by getting his fingertips to a Gonzalo Martinez shot that was swerving unpredictably in the air, somehow managing to push it off the post to keep his clean sheet.\n\nLionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez stole most of the attention in Japan, but while their excellence was nothing new, Luis Enrique will have taken more from the performance at the other end of the pitch. The goalkeeper's unwavering concentration and sharp reactions showed that he is just as viable an option for a decisive cup game as rival Ter Stegen is. Considering the Club World Cup is the only final Barcelona have managed to keep a clean sheet in under Luis Enrique, it could even be argued that Bravo is the safer choice.\n\nThe more consistent of the two keepers, Bravo has gone about proving his worth in a typically understated way. Ter Stegen catches the eye with his adventurous style, spectacular reaction saves and ambidexterity, but Bravo's less flashy qualities tend to pass without gaining the recognition they deserve.\n\nFormer Real Madrid manager Fabio Capello says Lionel Messi's absence due to injury was a good thing for Barcelona.\n\nWith strong hands that permit him to tip powerful shots away with only a single palm, he is also an intimidating presence in the air, rarely troubled by crosses. Despite his bulky frame, Bravo is agile, not afraid to come off his line to either participate in play with Barcelona's advanced defence or kill off an opposition attack.\n\nWhile Ter Stegen's high-risk approach to solving problems can create a tangible air of panic at the Camp Nou, Bravo is the opposite, exuding calm thanks to faultless decision-making that is too easily overlooked. He may not be as much of a showboat as his younger competitor, but Barca's No. 13 is no slouch with his feet either: his touch is excellent, his distribution almost always sound.\n\nThere are few faults to be found in Bravo's game these days, something that can be said about few players in his position. The spectacular levels he has attained this year mean it is time to start recognising him as one of the best goalkeepers in the world, and had he played in European competitions then he surely already would be.\n\nBravo may not rush out to the half-way line to attempt diving headers like Manuel Neuer, or try to win throw-ins by taking on wingers on the flank like Ter Stegen, but the number of high-profile errors he makes over the course of a season can be counted on one or two fingers. That is no small feat.\n\nThis year was already an outstanding one for the Chile international, but Luis Enrique's line-up decision in Japan suggests 2016 could be even better. The Barcelona coach now has proof that Bravo could produce the goods in a knockout competition like the Champions League, and if he decides to capitalise on that by playing him in Europe, then greater recognition of his world-class ability will surely follow. In any case, the stopper will continue to go about his business quietly, and spotlessly, as always.\n\nLee Roden is a European football writer based in Barcelona.

Yet whatever turbulent times the Bianconeri have experienced, they have stayed faithful to their winning mentality, coming back stronger than ever to put themselves in a great position to target yet another league title.\n\nOnce Massimiliano Allegri chose to rotate less, the strength of the individuals began to emerge. As the players grew confident and more in tune with the needs of those around them, unity was recovered to allow for cohesive performances. That is the beauty of Allegri; he always finds his balance eventually, even if his sides must be willing to accept a poor start to the season. In better leagues, rivals may not be so forgiving so as to allow his teams to race up the table after such tedious starts.\n\nArriving at Cagliari in 2008, the tactician lost his first five games with the Sardinians before eventually finding his feet to lift the team to a midtable position. At Milan, in his first season, he boasted players such as Andrea Pirlo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva yet collected only three points from his opening four matches despite playing against two newly promoted teams. Yet the dismal start soon ended and the Rossoneri finished the season as Serie A Champions.\n\nIn the 2012-13 season, his Milan side picked up only eight points from their first seven matches yet still managed to qualify for the Champions League by finishing third. That team was far less capable than this current Juve; few would bet against Allegri and his Old Lady collecting another trophy, especially if he continues to show the passion he demonstrated on the sidelines in the Carpi match.\n\nLosing Carlos Tevez, Arturo Vidal and Andrea Pirlo was always going to be tough, not only for what they produced on the pitch but for what they brought off it too: helping Allegri to focus on his strengths as a tactician.\n\nYet certain departures were necessary, and while management has been guilty of several mistakes, they did find young and intriguing replacements who have excelled after being shown a little patience. Allegri needed to prove he could handle new players and infect them with that desire to win all that lies before them, but where would he be without Gianluigi Buffon leading by example, Claudio Marchisio demanding wins from the new arrivals and Giorgio Chiellini playing like his life depended on it?\n\nWhile the likes of Alex Sandro, Paulo Dybala and Juan Cuadrado have delighted, Juventus owe much of their brilliance to their dressing-room leaders, the older stars who boast the fiercest desire. It is they, coupled with Allegri's tactics, who have helped relaunch a newly assembled Bianconeri side.\n\nWith a striking duo that now produces, the Turin giants are not only defensively sound thanks to their balanced 3-5-2 formation but offensively capable. While many hoped it would be Alvaro Morata alongside Dybala up top, leading Juve's line, it's been Mario Mandzukic who has been offered the opportunity to consistently start, developing in such a manner that his absence is keenly felt.\n\nPaulo Dybala, left, and Mario Mandzukic have developed one of the most feared strike partnerships in Europe.\n\nIn the past five matches the Croatian has played, he has either scored or provided assists, putting in man-of-the-match performances against both Lazio and Carpi. Whether it be holding up the ball to deliver the perfect pass to Dybala or displaying his predatory nature to exploit every mistake committed by the opponent, Mandzukic consistently displays the hunger he's been renowned for, making him the perfect player for the Bianconeri.\n\nIt wasn't easy for the ex-Atletico Madrid man, who suffered to find his way in Allegri's tactical patterns. Struggling to get the service he required, Mandzukic was barely converting his opportunities, producing statistics far removed from what he managed during his time in Madrid and at Bayern Munich. However, since the Atalanta match, the player seems to have found his way, producing nine goals; that's one more than either Ibrahimovic or David Trezeguet managed at this point in any season of their respective journeys with Juve, according to Corriere dello sport.\n\nWith Dybala producing the magic and his teammate providing the stealth, Juventus have one of the best striking partnerships in Europe -- and one that is still in its infancy and will develop even more. More important, they now know how to dig deep to find the wins, coming back after conceding, while the midfield is sacrificing tirelessly to secure the points.\n\nThe second half of the season sees them play several of the big Serie A fixtures at home. Should they continue to demonstrate this desire and intensity, Inter may just have to accept a different outcome to what they may have hoped for this year.\n\nMina Rzouki appears on BBC 5live, BBC Sportsworld, BT Sports, CNN, ESPN and Football Espana. You can follow her on Twitter @Minarzouki.", "Lionel Messi was Barcelona's golden boy in stellar 2015": "Former Barcelona attacker Ronaldinho believes the current trio of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar will make history.\n\nBarcelona are about to wave goodbye to one of the most successful years in club history, with the club in an endless sea of euphoria. Their spectacular 2015, which saw them lift a memorable five trophies, including La Liga, the Champions League and the Club World Cup, has already secured a place in the hearts of supporters all over the planet.\n\nThe year could not have started any worse, however. Nobody could have predicted that the shambolic team, which was deservedly defeated in their trip to Real Sociedad in early January, would go on to win any silverware that season, let alone rewrite the Blaugrana history books in the space of 12 months.\n\nIn fact, the relationship between Luis Enrique and many of his key players, including Lionel Messi and Neymar, was so broken that Cules were beginning to fear for the stars' long-term future at the Camp Nou. With the quadruple Ballon d'Or winner not even willing to speak to the manager after the infamous bust-up in the Anoeta dressing room, it soon became apparent that sacking the Asturian was possibly the only way forward.\n\nA lot changed in the space of a couple of weeks, fortunately. Although he remained true to his roots, Luis Enrique adopted a more approachable style, which brought him closer to his players. His conscious effort to listen to others' ideas, certainly influenced by his make-or-break conversation with Xavi and Andres Iniesta, was the key factor that turned a season destined for disaster into a resounding success.\n\nAfter Messi's falling out with Luis Enrique to start 2015, few could have predicted a historic run to five trophies.\n\nMost encouragingly, the team's visible improvement happened at an incredible speed, as if all of the pieces of the puzzle that Luis Enrique had been trying to assemble since his arrival in June 2014 had suddenly fallen into place. Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic understood the importance of their defensive duties, Dani Alves tamed his attacking hunger, Gerard Pique returned to his dominant self and Jordi Alba finally realised that his continuous runs forward without a contingency plan at the back were actually hurting the team.\n\nThe most decisive factor of all, however, was the way in which Messi evolved into the more generous, dominant player he is today. While theoretically deployed as a right winger, Luis Enrique gave his Argentine star enough freedom to float around the team's final third in whichever way he saw fit, always trying to make the most of the eventual gaps left within his opponents' back-line.\n\nIt was feared that the inclusion of Luis Suarez as the team's central attacking reference and the inevitable growth of the incisive Neymar would reduce Messi's spaces and, as a result, progressively diminish his influence. Luis Enrique's more direct system, which no longer focused on endless passing sequences in midfield but prioritised building from the back-line and quicker transitions toward the front three, was also seen as a less favourable scenario for La Pulga to excel in.\n\nNothing could have been further from the truth. Messi quickly understood that he would have to drop deeper into midfield if he was going to remain Barca's attacking leader. His new wide role enabled him far more space to run into, made him harder to mark and, in short, forced him into changing his game completely.\n\nGiven that rivals had become able to contain his efforts as a false nine with frustrating precision, Leo's evolution was the obvious way forward for not only the player himself, but also Barcelona as a whole. The Argentinean's movements became less predictable, his passes spread across a far larger area, he was far more involved during games, and, inevitably, he incorporated yet another dimension to his already bulging skill set.\n\nWhile Messi's finishing remained as lethal as ever, he clearly became a far more influential passer in 2015. With over two key passes per game, the No. 10 surpassed both Iniesta and Rakitic to become Barca's best provider under Luis Enrique. It truly is remarkable to see a player capable of scoring a jaw-dropping 91 goals in a calendar year evolving into such a generous playmaker in just three years, always putting the needs of the team before his own.\n\nFortunately for Cules, Messi's hunger for success remained a constant. If Barca is still a dominant force in world football, it is definitely thanks to the No. 10's willingness to improve on a daily basis, taking the club forward as a result. With the help of teammates and coaching staff, La Pulga has been the force that pulled through all the negativity surrounding the club and taken the club to an astounding five titles in 2015.\n\nAlthough Cules are fully aware that the sporting fairy tale they have been living in the last decade will eventually come to an end, there is reason to believe the current team has the potential to bring even further silverware to the Camp Nou museum in the near future.\n\nAs long as Messi remains healthy and supported by the exceptional team of individuals surrounding him, the dream of becoming the first ever team to win a back-to-back treble does not seem so distant.\n\nGracias for todo, Leo.

The Catalans, who created 16 chances and attempted 11 shots, dominated the final from beginning to end and were deserved winners.\n\nWith River opting for an aggressive approach to impede Barca from displaying their usual style, it took Luis Enrique's men an unusual amount of patience and self-control to impose their passing game.\n\nBarca's perseverance was rewarded with Messi's opener after 35 minutes. Having already broken their rival's high-pressing system, they were able to exploit the increasing amount of space left between River's lines to extend their lead shortly after the break.\n\nMessi, Neymar and Suarez made all the difference, but Luis Enrique deserves recognition for how he has astutely managed them.\n\nPlayer Ratings (1-10; 10=best.

His unpredictable combinations with Neymar were simply too much for River to handle.\n\nMF Sergio Busquets, 7 -- Ensured the transitions were quick enough to avoid giving River any unnecessary advantage. His textbook assist to Suarez, which secured his team's victory, was both simplistic and memorable in equal measure. Another dominant display from Barca's indispensable, silent leader.\n\nMF Andres Iniesta, 8 -- Switched on from the very first minute, driving the midfield forward with his trademark passing and dribbling. Once again, the elegant playmaker stepped up to lead his team when it mattered.\n\nMF Ivan Rakitic, 7 -- The perfect complement for Iniesta's creative leadership, the Croatian international ensured the ball kept flowing purposefully in the Catalans' final third.\n\nFW Neymar, 9 -- Despite being the target of constant tackles, the Brazilian remained confident and faced his markers one-on-one, fully aware that his ability and speed is currently second-to-none in world football. Picked up others' runs with relative ease, turning him into an absolute nightmare for River to defend against. Provided the assist for Messi's game-changing opener, then Suarez's second goal. While he did not get on the scoresheet, the No.11 was arguably the most influential player on the pitch.\n\nFW Luis Suarez, 9 -- Inexplicably failed to hit the target when facing the keeper one-on-one just seconds before the half-time whistle. Redeemed himself with a superb finish as soon as the game restarted, securing the victory with astounding efficiency, then scoring the team's third with an inch-perfect header. His unstoppable desire to give his all for the team has deservedly made him a club legend who will be revered in years to come.\n\nFW Lionel Messi, 9 -- Exploited the very few spaces left between the lines of the robust Argentinean defensive system. Drifted into central areas more often than usual, meaning that he was often left facing numerous defenders on his way to goal.

It looks like it could finally be Bayern's year, so long as Guardiola's men stay fit and focused.\n\nPrediction: Bayern Munich\n\nBarcelona vs. Arsenal\n\nArsene Wenger once used the term \"super-favourites\" to describe Barcelona, and he'd know. Arsenal's regular second-place finishes in the group stages means they tend to come up against the team that bears that tag almost every season, and this is the third time his side have met Lionel Messi and the Catalans in the last five years.\n\nWenger now has to come up with an idea of how to stop them, and that looks like a tall order. Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez are playing far above anything Arsenal have managed this season. For this match to be close, it's going to take a very bad night for that trio and a very good night for Arsenal.\n\nPrediction: Barcelona\n\nReal Madrid vs. Roma\n\nSome may see this as a mismatch, but in fact it could be rather close. Real Madrid qualified for the round of 16 after Cristiano Ronaldo scored more goals in a group stage than anyone in history, with 11. Roma, meanwhile, got through despite conceding more goals than any of the other sides in this round and with the lowest number of points ever needed to qualify (6).\n\nHowever, it's a bit more complex than that. Real has destroyed sides like Malmo, but these big wins have obscured the fact they've been very patchy this season and Ronaldo has struggled for goals in individual games as Rafael Benitez seems to have constrained their attack. Part of Roma's group record, meanwhile, is because they were destroyed 6-1 by Barcelona. Otherwise, there's been a glorious chaos to the Italians' campaign -- especially in the matches against Bayer Leverkusen -- and this match could go the same way. It could be very close.\n\nPrediction: Real Madrid\n\nChelsea vs. Paris Saint-German\n\nThese two teams have been paired up more than any others in the past few years, but at least the matches are unpredictable because they are so evenly matched. This year's is more unpredictable than ever. That's primarily because it's hard to know what Chelsea will turn up in February. They have been bad domestically, but there have been hints of an upturn of late, and Branislav Ivanovic recently told ESPN FC of how the side have felt released in Europe.\n\nParis Saint-Germain, meanwhile, have moved up a level since beating Chelsea on away goals in the round of 16 last season. That was also the point at which we started to see a different and more restrained Chelsea, and the question is whether these changes can swing the match. With so many variables that could easily change the outcome, this pairing could go either way. The teams' last two round of 16 meetings have been decided by the away-goal rule or extra time. This one may go the same way.\n\nPrediction: Chelsea\n\nWolfsburg vs. Gent\n\nPerhaps the least glamorous matchup, but one of these teams will be reaching the quarterfinals for the first time and, in a competition where a lack of variety has been a problem, that is something to cherish. Gent have been one of the stories of the season, brilliantly knocking out Valencia in the group stage.\n\nEven though Wolfsburg have never been in the last eight, they aren't quite a surprise package given the quality in their squad and the money they've spent. The way their swift football exposed Manchester United to knock out Louis van Gaal's side emphasised that, and that technique should be enough here.\n\nPrediction: Wolfsburg\n\nPSV Eindhoven vs. Atletico Madrid\n\nGiven the departures of key players like Memphis Depay and Georginio Wijnaldum, combined with injuries to key players, PSV's passage to this stage is arguably more stunning than Gent's. The Dutch club, who beat Manchester United at home and drew at Old Trafford in the group stage, have done supremely well to get this far, greatly defying the odds.\n\nThe problem here is that they're up against a side who have been there and have mastered defying the odds, both in Spain and in the Champions League. Atletico, runners-up to Real Madrid in the 2014 final, should prove too much.\n\nPrediction: Atletico Madrid\n\nBenfica vs. Zenit St Petersburg\n\nThese are two sides that have made themselves very hard to beat, making this match hard to call. The pair met in last year's group stage, with Zenit winning twice, and the Russian side did enjoy a five-game winning streak to finish first in their group.\n\nThe problem with them is that they've been so frustratingly unreliable in knockout stages, whereas Benfica have developed a great deal of experience in that regard due to their Europa League runs. That was under manager Jorge Jesus rather than Rui Vitoria, though, so that change might just tip it towards Zenit.\n\nPrediction: Zenit\n\nDynamo Kiev vs. Man City\n\nThis match offers the chance of a breakthrough for both these teams. Dynamo have reached the round of 16 for the first time since 2000 -- and the first time in the modern Champions League without either Andriy Shevchenko or Serhiy Rebrov up front -- but that in itself gives City the chance to finally reach the quarterfinals for the first time in their history.\n\nDynamo ultimately finished second after making life difficult in the group stages for Chelsea and Porto, while City overcame defeats to Juventus to finish first. Manuel Pellegrini's side should have too much firepower, even if they do suffer one of their customary drops in intensity.\n\nPrediction: Manchester City\n\n\n\n\n\nMiguel Delaney is a London-based correspondent for ESPN FC and also writes for the Irish Examiner and others. Follow him on Twitter @MiguelDelaney.", "Everton's Romelu Lukaku stars but Tim Howard a dud vs Stoke": "Everton manager Roberto Martinez was frustrated by a late penalty which gave Stoke the opportunity to break their tie.\n\nAfter the late win at Newcastle had Evertonians daring to hope their team had turned a corner, it took just two days and a 4-3 home defeat against Stoke to crush such a foolishly optimistic notion.\n\nNo amount of finger pointing toward officials for the decisive penalty can excuse the Blues conceding twice in the final 10 minutes, especially having trailed twice before eventually taking the lead in the second half.\n\nSaturday's match-winner Tom Cleverley had set his sights on the top six in the Boxing Day aftermath. If his teammates continue to defend in this fashion, those aims will be as unlikely as they seem now. Everton are still without successive league wins this season.\n\nThe sustained excellence of Romelu Lukaku only heightens frustration with a team with all the defensive solidity of a sandcastle. No matter the opposition, scoring five goals in the last two home games should be enough to claim six points. The actual return of no points is simply unacceptable, so too is shipping seven goals at the other end.\n\nThere were four changes from Boxing Day, with manager Roberto Martinez clearly mindful of a second game in three days. But those changes revealed their own problems and returned Everton to the exact starting XI that has embraced the festive spirit much too literally and spent December presenting points to grateful opponents. The same formula produces the same outcome, while Martinez and his players continue to talk a better game than the one they deliver on the pitch.\n\nEven with the temporary boost delivered by three points on Boxing Day, this has been a desperately disappointing month for a team with an alarming lack of grit, leadership and backbone, both on the pitch and in the dugout. Injuries to midfielders James McCarthy and Cleverley merely rubbed salt in the various wounds.\n\nEverton Everton Stoke City Stoke City 3 4 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nPlayer ratings (1-10; 10=best; players introduced after 70 minutes get no rating):\n\nGK Tim Howard, 4 -- The energy wasted sarcastically applauding his own fans could have been put to use attempting even a nominal save for the Stoke second. Allergy to crosses resurfaced for the third goal.\n\nDF Seamus Coleman, 7 -- Blameless for the defensive chaos surrounding him, Coleman dealt well with the Stoke threat on his flank. Unreliable crossing in the final third proved the only blemish on his afternoon.\n\nDF John Stones, 5 -- Harshly penalised for the penalty that decided the match, but this was an uncharacteristically poor performance full of defensive missteps and misplaced passes.\n\nDF Ramiro Funes Mori, 6 -- Neither the best nor the worst of those in blue, the Argentine coped better than most with the movement and pace of the visitors' attacking players.\n\nDF Brendan Galloway, 5 -- Caught out for the first two Stoke goals and struggled to stem the tide down his flank. Not helped by Martinez's perseverance with a setup that leaves the youngster isolated and overrun.\n\nMF James McCarthy, 5 -- Managed a tidy assist for Lukaku's opening goal before injury ended his afternoon early, but otherwise looked like a player rushed back too soon.\n\nMF Gareth Barry, 8 -- How Everton could do with more players echoing the leadership, work rate and overall influence provided by their stand-in captain. It was his intelligent use of the ball at the heart of the second half spell briefly threatening three points.\n\nMF Gerard Deulofeu, 7 -- Disappeared when Stoke led in the earlier stages but improved in the second half and his goal should have been enough for Everton to claim the three points.\n\nMF Ross Barkley, 8 -- Involved in two of the three home goals, this was another authoritative midfield display from Barkley, who has directly contributed to 13 goals in 19 league games this season, with six goals and seven assists to his name.\n\nMF Arouna Kone, 4 -- Complete lack of positional discipline left Galloway fighting an unwinnable battle against Stoke duo Glen Johnson and Xherdan Shaqiri, while the nearer he gets to the opposing goal, the more his goal threat seems to diminish.\n\nFW Romelu Lukaku, 9 -- A class above most players on the pitch, the in-form forward is the league's joint top scorer and led a one-man recovery mission that would have succeeded but for familiar failings elsewhere.\n\nDespite a brace from Romelu Lukaku, Everton came up short against Stoke.\n\nSubstitutes:\n\nMF Tom Cleverley, 8 -- One of the better performers for Everton. His introduction for the injured McCarthy in the 26th minute improved the home side and an exquisite assist for Lukaku's second showed his passing range.\n\nMF Steven Naismith, 5 -- Struggled to affect the game after replacing Cleverley in the 65th minute. He fired narrowly wide via a deflection with his only opening. Almost gifted Stoke a goal with a stray pass.\n\nLuke writes about Everton for EPL Index and his View from the Royal Blue Mersey blog. Follow Luke on Twitter @lukeofarrell.", "Looking ahead to the 2016 Major League Soccer season": "Former MLS striker Brian McBride joins ESPN's Alexis Nunes to outline the transfer moves to watch for this offseason.\n\nThe 2015 MLS season has now been consigned to the record books, and what a campaign it was. It witnessed an MVP season from Sebastian Giovinco, the rise of modest-spending clubs, a record attendance mark, plenty of drama in the postseason, and a stellar run to the MLS Cup crown by the Portland Timbers.\n\nBut now is the time for the league and its fans to look ahead and, with that in mind, here are the storylines to follow in 2016.\n\n1. Will the wave of big names continue?\n\nThe 2015 season was notable for the number of stars that joined MLS. Giovinco, Steven Gerrard, Didier Drogba, Giovani dos Santos, Andrea Pirlo and Frank Lampard all arrived, while the reverse migration of U.S. national team players from Europe also continued with Jozy Altidore signing with Toronto FC.\n\nThe incoming stars' fortunes were decidedly mixed. Drogba and Giovinco were outstanding. Lampard and Gerrard found the going more difficult. The extent to which this trend will continue is uncertain. Carlos Vela and Ashley Cole are rumored to be on the move, but pen hasn't been put to paper just yet.\n\nThe 2015 season was also notable for the success of teams like FC Dallas and Supporters' Shield winners the New York Red Bulls -- teams that didn't break the bank with their signings. It will be interesting to see how the success of these teams influences the direction that others take to revamp their rosters.\n\n2. Can Portland repeat?\n\nTimbers manager Caleb Porter has already set a target of repeating as champions, and it's not an impossible task, since it's been done before by the D.C. United teams of the late 1990s, the Houston Dynamo sides of the mid-2000s and, more recently, the LA Galaxy teams at the start of the current decade.\n\nBut the rules and structure of MLS work against the formation of dynasties. The salary cap goes up five percent each year, but player salaries go up a standard 10 percent per annum. That makes it difficult for teams to build on the rosters they already have.\n\nAccording to SI.com, Portland has sold left-back Jorge Villafana to Liga MX side Santos Laguna for a fee in the high six figures. That should help keep the core of the side together. Other teams aren't standing still however, which brings us to...\n\n3. Can the titans retool?\n\nIn 2014, when the LA Galaxy hoisted MLS Cup and the Seattle Sounders won the Supporters' Shield, there was every reason to think that both teams would continue to duke it out for league supremacy.\n\nInstead, a year later they were meeting in the knockout round of the playoffs due to some uneven play in the latter half of the season. Injuries and an aging roster doomed Seattle, while the Galaxy lacked balance between attack and defense after the midseason arrivals of Gerrard and dos Santos.\n\nYet there are plenty of reasons to think that both sides will rebound. Galaxy's head coach and general manager Bruce Arena is a master at manipulating the league's roster rules, while Seattle GM Garth Lagerwey has previously shown his ability to construct a championship roster.\n\nThe increase in Targeted Allocation Money --more on that below -- will no doubt help both sides and there is considerable quality on both rosters as well. Whether that is enough to leapfrog the likes of Dallas, Vancouver and reigning MLS Cup champions Portland will be well worth watching.\n\nESPN FC's Max Bretos, Ale Moreno and Taylor Twellman look at the 2015 MLS season and how it compares to previous years.\n\n4. What will the first year of free agency (and more TAM) bring?\n\nThe players' signature gain in this year's collective bargaining agreement was a limited form of free agency. There is a cap on the percentage a free agent's salary can increase, and the percentage depends on how much said player is currently making.\n\nYet for the first time, a select group of players will have say in where they end up and teams will be in a position to bid -- with the aforementioned limitations -- on their services. Already, Sporting Kansas City minority owner Robb Heineman has begun a Twitter-based recruiting push for Justin Mapp and former league MVP Mike Magee.\n\nOf course, public lobbying is one thing, reality is another, and you can bet the MLS Players Union will be carefully watching how many free agents are signed and for how much.\n\nFactoring into the offseason machinations of teams will be the amount of Targeted Allocation Money (or TAM) that gets pumped into the system. The system was announced in the middle of last season, and it gave clubs $500,000 to buy down the salaries of those players over the Designated Player threshold.\n\nMLS announced Tuesday that an additional $800,000 will be added for 2016 and another $800,000 in 2017. The task of building teams - and getting things right - has never been tougher for team executives.\n\n5. Expansion\n\nTen years ago, MLS was practically begging for expansion teams to join the league. Now there is no shortage of candidates.\n\nAtlanta United, Minnesota United, and Los Angeles FC are all slated to join within the next three years. The news that David Beckham's group has finally found a site for a stadium has cemented their status as the league's 24th team. But MLS isn't stopping there, announcing last weekend that it intends to expand to 28 teams.\n\nThat is great news for Sacramento, who has checked all the boxes in terms of its fan base, investors and stadium plans. But that still leaves plenty of cities jockeying for position, including Detroit, St. Louis, San Diego and San Antonio.\n\nRelive the best moments of the 2015 MLS season, including the arrival of new stars and the crowning of a first-time champion.\n\n6. A new wave of coaches and GMs\n\nAll the head coaching and general manager positions are filled, but there will be plenty of eyes on them to see how they fare. Patrick Vieira has taken the head coaching reins at New York City FC, and he'll need plenty of help from the front office -- one that didn't distinguish itself last season -- to get up to speed.\n\nNelson Rodriguez is the new GM in Chicago, and he appointed former Serbia Under-20 manager Veljko Paunovic as the new head coach, who has a bit of a head start on Vieira since he spent a season in Philadelphia as a player.\n\nSpeaking of Philadelphia, Earnie Stewart will officially begin life as the Union's sporting director at the start of the year.\n\nOne move that flew a bit under the radar was Orlando City's appointment of Armando Carneiro as the Chief Soccer Officer. Carneiro boasts an impressive resume from his time as the general director of Portuguese side Benfica, but has almost no knowledge of MLS.\n\nRegardless, it's certain that the offseason won't lack for intrigue.\n\nJeff Carlisle covers MLS and the U.S. national team for ESPN FC.

With speculation intensifying that Zinedine Zidane is next in line for the manager's job at the Bernabeu, ESPN FC's Graham Hunter writes this open letter explaining why the smart move would be for Zidane to turn it down.\n\nDear Zizou,\n\nI write with a warning. We've only spoken in news conferences but the best advice comes when it is accurate, honest, unflinching and is given whether or not there's much chance of the recipient listening. Sometimes hard things are best said by an outsider so that those close to you don't have to venture it first -- but can say \"Well, he might have a point.\"\n\nYou can't have failed to hear the \"bronca\" that the fans at the Bernabeu gave the team and the president on Sunday afternoon as they scored 10 times against Rayo. The booing, the whistling, the jeering -- the avalanche of disgust and dissatisfaction.\n\nIt began while some players were having their names read out before the match, including the famous BBC of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. It reached a window-rattling crescendo at 2-1 down but surged back at halftime and in the final seconds before the game ended, as soon as Los Blancos began circulating the ball while waiting for the referee's whistle with the score 10-2.\n\nMadrid's biggest win since 1960 and it didn't even begin to dampen the fury of the fans. In all your career you've never suffered anything quite like that. Whether it made you shiver or made you consider is up to you. But it's time that someone warned you: If Rafa Benitez is sacked, either soon or by the end of the season, do not take the job.\n\nFor your own sake, do not take it. Do not take it for the good of the club where you've spent so much of your working life since 2001. By turning it down, you can do a massive service to yourself and, in the same action, begin a process that will allow more and more around the Bernabeu to admit that something's clearly wrong at the club.\n\nZizou, try thinking of it this way: It has been 15 years since Florentino Perez gave you what you called \"the happiest day of my life\" by pushing a little serviette toward you across the table during UEFA's annual Champions League gala in Monte Carlo. To his question, \"Voulez vous jouer avec Le Real Madrid?\" you answered \"Yes!\" and for you, that wasn't the worst answer you could have given.\n\nThe club made you richer, both financially and in terms of the one trophy you yearned for, the Champions League. Your apprenticeship as a general manager, ambassador, consiglieri and junior coach has all been sketched out with Madrid. You even helped Florentino begin his push for presidential power again in 2008 -- you and Ronaldo flanked him in Fez for a brilliant publicity photo-op the day before the UN Match against Poverty captained by you and that brilliant Brazilian striker.\n\nBut 2001 was still the time when the fundamental football poverty of Florentino's \"Galactico\" regime had yet to be properly exposed. And 2009 was the \"fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me\" moment when the Madrid public said, en masse, \"better the devil you know\" and let Florentino in unopposed. Shame on them.\n\nThings are different now. Many of those making unhappy protests on Sunday afternoon were simply representatives of a general mood around your club that fundamental change is required -- starting with a realisation that something basic is wrong.\n\nPerez might be grooming Zidane for the manager's job but the Real legend would be smart to say no.\n\nJorge Valdano, a long-term Florentino acolyte and Madrid's general director when you signed from Juventus, pointed out: \"There's something broken between the team and the Bernabeu.\" It's a strong, telling phrase.\n\nAs for the banner that security guards removed from the stadium so that it could no longer be featured on TV cameras or seen by newspaper photographers? In case you missed it: \"Not 'Ultra,' not violent -- just tired of your dictatorship, Florentino.\" Think back less than a month to the \"Florentino resign!\" chants all around the Bernabeu as Barcelona romped to victory there. Again.\n\nThere will come a time when Florentino thinks it expedient to sack Benitez and to promote you. But you need to be aware that he'll be doing it as a palliative remedy for the fans and media. He'll do it to put a buffer between him and the rising tide of \"anti-Florentino\" feeling and without using your coaching skills as the main criterion for promotion.\n\nAll benign dictators who rule unilaterally (and that's certainly how Florentino views his fiefdom) inherently believe that they know better than the plebs -- that the seething masses simply need to be fed some kind of opiate while the \"great men\" get on with making decisions and making money.\n\nIn due course, you'll be that opiate. Unless there's a seismic shift in performances, relationships between the squad and the current coach -- plus a huge shift in the degree to which Madridistas are sick of seeing Barcelona rack up trophies and adoration -- the president will decide that you are his latest \"buffer.\" The fanfare will be understandable: Give a great club into the hands of a great ex-footballer who's been gaining his qualifications, his experience and who's always been as much of a warrior as he was an elegant athlete.\n\nIt's a seductive proposition, but think of this from your point of view. There's something fundamentally wrong with how Florentino runs the club.\n\nPerez's approach to running Real is inherently flawed, meaning managers like Benitez are routinely cast out.\n\nPlayers are bought and sold on the wrong criteria -- football-wise at least. Any Real Madrid coach working for Florentino Perez will be subject to the whims of a club president who also considers himself the de facto director of football. He's the emperor who keeps saying \"Don't you adore my beautiful new clothes?\" to his subjects, most of whom don't dare to point out that he has been reduced to his birthday suit.\n\nZizou, you once used a phrase about yourself which I loved. \"I suppose it would have been easy to have let all the adulation go to my head but I never once mistook all of that for real life. Real life is having people around you who tell you when you've messed up, when you've been an idiot.\n\n\"I suppose if you were really stupid you would start believing it when people tell you you're the best but I just saw it as another aspect of my life as a footballer and never felt the need for adulation. My own feet were always firmly on the ground and even when we won the World Cup I said to myself 'That's great: but it's not real life!\"\n\nTake a look upward in the organisation. Tell me: Is this how Florentino behaves? How he thinks?\n\nIt's feasible that a transfer market ban is in the offing -- something which, if the rumblings prove true, would stunt the club's ability to fully restructure an imbalanced squad that's aging in key positions and is currently populated by two or three major assets who are arguably yearning for pastures new. If you take the mid-term view, then no matter how talented you prove to be as a coach there may well be trouble ahead.\n\nFormer Real Madrid star Zinedine Zidane gives Rafael Benitez given his backing.\n\nFine, most \"great\" men believe that they have the solution. Even that they are the solution. Given your past, your football brain, your personality and your diligent completion of all the relevant post-career qualifications, you are perfectly entitled to feel that way if you choose.\n\nPerhaps in due course, you will prove as excellent a coach as you were a footballer. I'd love that to be true but there's another, bigger, more utilitarian concept to think about when you eventually get that phone call from \"Don Florentino.\" If you say no, there's a real chance that the focus on Florentino's deficiencies (which are very real despite his number of evident qualities) will become irresistibly strong.\n\nThe furor over you not succeeding Benitez would die down quickly and attention would turn to a more generic idea. \"If Zizou doesn't want to become the next hire-'em-and-fire-'em coach for Florentino, then something is really wrong.\"\n\nFans, socios, media, players, directors, sponsors -- the pressure on this faulty president and, more importantly, his sporting philosophy, would potentially be irresistible. Already, one influential radio station is stating that Florentino's most trusted adviser, Jose Angel Sanchez, is counseling that while not mandatory, presidential elections should be set for next summer.\n\nAnd so this feels like a potentially watershed moment. If the Rafa \"experiment\" is deemed not to have worked, it will spark a wider public referendum on whether or not the Florentino regime is fundamentally flawed. You could help galvanise that debate and, as such, do your current club a huge favour. Democratise it, modernise it, give it balance, give it a chance at a proper football philosophy.\n\nIt's up to you, Zizou mon brave. It's just like your life on the football pitch -- time to do the smart, challenging, forward-thinking thing, not just the easy, obvious one.\n\nWith the greatest respect, GH\n\nGraham Hunter covers Spain for ESPN FC and Sky Sports. Author of \"Barca: The Making of the Greatest Team in the World.\" Twitter: @BumperGraham.", "Gary Neville must adapt quickly in order to fix Valencia": "Valencia head coach Gary Neville puts faith in the players already at the club instead of feeding transfer obsession.\n\nGary Neville has conducted 99 percent of his preparatory work behind closed doors -- whether training under Sir Alex Ferguson and various England managers, preparing himself mentally for challenges on the football fields of Europe, building a business empire or ensuring he's one of the most well-respected sports analysts in the game.\n\nSo it was a drastic change Monday when the Valencia players trotted out for their full-scale training session in front of more than 2,000 expectant fans at the Paterna training ground. It's a La Liga tradition -- there are many \"open\" training sessions across the league campaign but almost without exception, teams open doors for parents and kids during the festive season.\n\nI guess there was a decision there for Neville to make: accept the local custom and turn it into a positive, or enforce new rules. It might look like a small issue at face value, but it's not.\n\nJournalists and fans, particularly kids and \"socios\" (members), feast on having this unfettered access when they can watch training methods, see the stars working out and take home gossip about the \"atmosphere\" on the training ground. It's like an off-the-cuff \"health check\" on the club they either love or that directly affects their professional life.\n\nBan it and you invoke an ill feeling -- \"just another foreigner who shouldn't be here\" is usually the response to such a tactic. But allow it and there's a chance that fans and media see things that are either embarrassing, controversial or theoretically \"secret.\" For now, at least, Neville accepts the concept despite it flying directly in the face of his experiences to the contrary.\n\nHis boss, Valencia CF owner Peter Lim, recently tried for a bit of his own PR. Realising that this is a precarious time for the club, his relationship with the fans, the finances and their football performances for the remainder of the season, the Singaporean billionaire published a video interview just before Christmas. In it he argued that he hadn't appointed Neville just because \"he's a friend,\" but because he felt the Manchester United legend had a capacity to inspire and has \"learned a lot from Sir Alex Ferguson.\"\n\nOne of the facets Neville must show he picked up from his mentor is when, how and for what reason to make tough decisions. (The answers, normally, being \"early, firmly and based on a mix of experience, advice and instinct.\") It's only recently that Ferguson has highlighted how much more important he judges his decision-making skills to have been, compared to his competitors, than has been given credit.\n\nPromoting his book recently, Ferguson confirmed: \"Some people can make decisions others can't. Usually you make a decision either too early or too late. I prefer to make them early. It doesn't work if you're hesitant by nature and allow things to linger. Others are in a perpetual quest for the last possible morsel of information, using that as an excuse not to make a decision.\"\n\nAnd of course, this vital skill doesn't simply apply to picking the right XI or reacting tactically within a match.\n\nAny club manager will need to make upwards of 20 important decisions a day. Almost every day. So, with a view to how Neville makes 2016 better than how the past few months of 2015 have been for Valencia, here are five things he needs to deal with decisively, intelligently and confidently.\n\n1. Which competition to prioritise?\n\n2015 finishes (on Fergie's birthday) with a massively important local derby away to Villarreal, who are eight points ahead in the fifth European place. It's a nice precursor to three imminent, key matches: Real Madrid at the Mestalla, plus a home-and-away pair against Granada in the Copa del Rey.\n\nFrankly, Valencia fans probably crave beating Madrid more than any other team in Spain -- it's a grudge match. So, a priority?\n\nInterestingly, Valencia could easily face Barcelona in the next round if they eliminate Granada -- Neville's first competitive return to the Camp Nou since winning that most dramatic Champions League final in 1999. It's a competition Los Che would love to win. But is beating Granada a priority?\n\nWhat about the relative value of the three competitions -- La Liga, the Copa and the Europa League -- in which Valencia are still active this season?\n\nGary Neville is still finding his feet at Valencia but prioritising their games in 2016 will be a tough task.\n\nValencia don't have the experience, depth of squad, talent or budget to say in all good faith that they'll compete equally hard for all three. Not if they want to avoid making a major tactical mistake. For example, competing flat out in Copa, expending physical and mental resources, perhaps picking up injuries but then falling away in the chase for the fiercely important top four positions in La Liga.\n\nValencia need the continued revenue of the Champions League next season, and for the foreseeable future. So must the glory of a run in Copa be sacrificed?\n\nAlso, the Europa League can look like a slog -- it's vastly competitive if you evaluate the remaining teams and testing to stay consistently on-form from January until mid-May. But only nine good performances away from winning both the trophy and guaranteed entry into the Champions League.\n\nThe Copa will glitter and tantalise, and winning it would be a massive fillip for a club that hasn't won anything since 2008. Yet Neville may have to decide, publicly or privately, that the slog of the league and the lure of the Champions League qualification via winning the Europa League must be prioritised.\n\n2. A surplus of super keepers\n\nThe best news for Neville on Monday wasn't that 2,000-plus turned up to watch training but that Diego Alves, the club's most important player, was finally back at work seven months after damaging his knee ligaments.\n\nAlves is just superb as a keeper. He's an exemplary captain and someone whose implacable confidence and professionalism rubs off on all those around him. Once fully fit, it would be a massive shock if he doesn't take the gloves again.\n\nSo what of their expensive, talented and well-liked import Mat Ryan -- youngest winner of the Australian PFA player of the season award in 2015, the Harry Kewell Medal 2015 and Asian Cup winner last January? And what of hugely popular, young, talented and competitive local boy Jaume Domenech, who's currently the number one after Alves' and Ryan's injuries?\n\nSell one? Loan one out? Which one? Keep them all? It's a testing decision for the coach in terms of making the right choice for the team, plus how the media and fans assess and accept Neville's managerial call. And, crucially, how the Englishman is then viewed by all three keepers and the rest of the squad. They'll be watching closely too.\n\n3. Injuries, medical treatment, recuperation\n\nSince he took over, there has been almost a full team's worth of injuries to important players. Neville has asked for a full report into why it is that so many footballers are injured, slow to recover, repeatedly injured and how to avoid that.\n\nMost managers already find dealing with medical and recuperation staff testing because there can be a clash between what a coach wants, what the medical department recommends and how \"brave\" each player is about their return date. Some footballers are made of crystal, some of titanium. Add the hurdle of linguistic difficulties between medical/physiological in Spanish or English and this is a potential minefield.\n\nThe return of Diego Alves, left, is a major boost but what should he do with his other talented goalies?\n\nThe new manager will have to assimilate all the information he's gathered and take a view as to how to get more of his fulcrum players fit for more of the time between now and May. Different medical treatment? Different physio and recuperation methods? Changes in training methods?\n\nThese are big decisions with big repercussions.\n\n4. Which brand of football should they play?\n\nValencia's English manager values energy, intelligence and pressing -- the idea of putting opponents on the back foot and posing them problems. It's a demanding brand of soccer, synthesising tactical awareness, an understanding of the manager's philosophy, match sharpness and strong stamina. In other words, it's a big ask for a group of players who are young, short on confidence, short on experience, still learning Neville's concepts and, notably, lacking in both sharpness and stamina.\n\nIn such circumstances, does a manager opt for pragmatism? Does a young, relatively inexperienced coach begin to think of blocking his midfield, protecting the back four, allowing opposition the ball and then punishing errors on the break?\n\n5. How to manage upwards and outwards?\n\nNeville's management skills need to apply not just to his players, his staff and the medical/fitness team at the Mestalla. It's now a major challenge during the months until the end of the season as to how he manages \"upwards\" and \"outwards.\"\n\nHow he meshes what is achievable with what his line managers Lay Hoon and Peter Lim believe is achievable will be an interesting test of his diplomacy, his communication skills and how he decides to brief them. Is it better to be blunt, factual and dealing solely in facts? Or should he stoke their dreams, share ambitious predictions and have a more bullish approach?\n\nValencia's fans and media might not be deluded but they are remorselessly judgemental, vastly ambitious and unwilling to accept that Los Che aren't serious trophy contenders despite their youth and lack of one or two elite footballers.\n\nNeville needs to decide what message he gives them in advance, not just as issues, wins, defeats and rows emerge. He needs to establish a central, sound and thematic message. It's a big decision, strategic and testing. But one of only many which will test how well he learned from Alexander Chapman Ferguson.\n\nGraham Hunter covers Spain for ESPN FC and Sky Sports. Author of \"Barca: The Making of the Greatest Team in the World.\" Twitter: @BumperGraham.", "Wayne Rooney passing for Man United a highlight vs Chelsea": "Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes his side dominated the match and deserved to win against Chelsea.\n\nIn this most unpredictable of seasons, Manchester United and Chelsea concluded their years with the most predictable of results. A total of three goals had featured in the last three league games between these sides at Old Trafford and, with legs and minds reeling from Boxing Day, a scoreless draw duly materialised.\n\nThe lineups never hinted at anything else. United's lone forward was Wayne Rooney, who had scored two league goals since April, while Chelsea, who were without the suspended Diego Costa and the injured duo of Loic Remy and Falcao, gave the role to Eden Hazard, who last found the net for his club in May. In fact, none in the visiting squad had scored more than twice in the league all season. Subsequent events would indicate why.\n\nManchester United Manchester United Chelsea Chelsea 0 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nLooking to avoid their first five-game losing streak since 1936, United bossed the opening 25 minutes and applied a high pressure that Chelsea struggled to bypass. The full-backs stormed forward and Anthony Martial took on Branislav Ivanovic at every opportunity. On the rare occasions that Chelsea did have the ball, they missed the presence of a natural striker, with Hazard isolated as he dropping deep. The champions eventually improved on a woeful first half, but slowly tired and would have lost had Rooney's finishing been as good as his link-up play.\n\nInstead, United were left to contemplate a run of eight games without victory, while Chelsea have now failed to win any of their last seven league games away from home.\n\nUnited pin back Chelsea\n\nManchester United dominated the opening exchanges at Old Trafford against Chelsea.\n\nAt the very least, United boss Louis van Gaal could take heart from the opening period. The formational battle was 4-2-3-1 versus 4-2-3-1, but United's his interpretation was more ambitious and full-backs Ashley Young and Matteo Darmian practically played as wingers at times. Elsewhere, Juan Mata drifted inside, Martial stayed out wide and Rooney functioned as a kind of target man, receiving passes to feet and bringing others into play.\n\nFielding a defensive midfield duo in John Obi Mikel and Nemanja Matic, Chelsea interim manager Guus Hiddink saw his side struggle to play their way out. They completed just 35 out of 61 passes in the first 25 minutes -- a completion rate of 57.4 percent -- as United recorded 179 out of 202. Their only chance in this period was a John Terry header from a corner that arose only due to a slip by Daley Blind. At the other end United's spells of possession should have been converted into goals, as Mata and Martial smacked shots into the woodwork.\n\nMartial goes solo\n\nManchester United forward Anthony Martial was not afraid to take on his man against Chelsea.\n\nParticularly lively was Martial. Inside seven minutes he had already taken on Ivanovic, and nine minutes later he skipped past the Serb to hit the inside of the near post. Another foray yielded an unheard penalty shout, while a quick break forced Mikel to foul him and get booked. On 56 minutes, he stormed past Pedro and crossed for Ander Herrera, whose four-yard finish was somehow kept out by Thibaut Courtois. All in all Martial actually completed just two of his 11 attempted dribbles, and Chelsea often shuffled players across to help Ivanovic, but the exceptions to the rule created danger.\n\nBlues miss natural striker\n\nChelsea's lack of a natural front man showed against Manchester United.\n\nIn the previous two games in which Hazard had started as a lone striker, Chelsea had played 0-0 at Tottenham and lost 1-0 at home to Bournemouth. On neither occasion had the Belgian played badly, yet the story here was a similar one. When he dropped deep to collect possession, Chelsea never had the framework to facilitate efficient link-up play or decisive passes. Neither of Pedro, Oscar and Willian made regular runs in behind the defence, and so United were able to push up their back line and condense space between the lines. At times Hazard blatantly needed willing runners, and the movement of Costa or Remy would surely have helped.\n\nContributing to this was the fact that Hazard made few initiatives himself. On one occasion late in the first half, Mikel broke forward only to find him waiting to get the ball to feet. Though this is a natural predilection for Hazard, it often left him outnumbered as Morgan Schneiderlin and Bastian Schweinsteiger did well at protecting their centre-backs. The main exception to this came shortly after half-time, when Hazard managed to slalom through the centre and find Pedro, who was denied by goalkeeper David De Gea before Cesar Azpilicueta suffered the same fate. Yet the biggest Chelsea chance came without his involvement, when Matic skied a one-on-one after a counter-attack.\n\nAll in all Hazard only created that one chance and had no attempts. Out of the four dribbles completed and six fouls won, all were closer to the halfway line than to De Gea's goal.\n\nRooney links up play\n\nManchester United captain Wayne Rooney's forward passing was improved against Chelsea\n\nElsewhere in the category of inefficient forwards, Rooney failed with all of his three dribbles, missed a huge chance in which he was offside anyway, squandered another golden opportunity late on, and picked up a booking. The fact that his display could yet be regarded as a personal improvement denotes the kind of forgettable season the captain is having.\n\nThe positive note here was his passing. Amid weak competition, Rooney was his side's top chance creator. One delivery set up Mata's crossbar strike, another led to a Schneiderlin effort, while a neat flick released Martial down the left. There was even a hint of the Rooney of old when he let fly from 25 yards, even if other situations evoked more recent form, such as the fluffed finish from Mata's pass and the misdirected volley four minutes from full-time.\n\nOverall though, Rooney created three created opportunities and recorded a decent pass completion rate of 82 percent. That said, the fact that such achievements have merited their own section in this very report probably underlines the level of attacking quality on display.\n\nFourFourTwo Stats Zone provides live in-game data, scores, alerts and animated chalkboards.

Wanderers to test undermanned Jets\n\nNewcastle Jets are set to have around AU$425,000 to spend on three signings in the January transfer window, with the sale of left-back Lee Ki-je to the K-League's Ulsan Hyundai now inevitable. These funds will prove crucial for new coach Scott Miller, who must reignite a side that has now gone 289 minutes without scoring.\n\nFirst in line to spark the attack is Adam Taggart. The former Jets' striker has returned to Fulham after his loan deal with Dundee United was cut short. Miller, a former assistant coach at Craven Cottage, has spoken to Taggart in an effort to convince him to return to Hunter Stadium, though it appears unlikely he will want to come back to the A-League just 18 months after departing.\n\nCover in attacking midfield due to the ongoing injury woes of Leonardo, as well as some depth at the back, would also be welcomed. However, these acquisitions will not arrive in time to help the Jets as they travel to league leaders Western Sydney Wanderers on Christmas Eve.\n\nAdding to Miller's conundrum, the visitors will be without right-back Jason Hoffman, who is suspended. Meanwhile, Western Sydney have an abundance of squad depth, as they welcome back versatile forward Mark Bridge and central midfielder Dimas this week.\n\nJanuary can't come soon enough for the Jets, and they will be severely tested by a fired-up Wanderers side this Thursday before they are able to regroup in the New Year.\n\n2. Fifth straight loss unthinkable for Victory\n\nFew would have predicted that reigning champions Melbourne Victory would suffer a midseason slump to this extent. Losing four games in a row is incomprehensible for a team with their capability. Make no mistake, though, Kevin Muscat's men still remain one of the teams to beat this season.\n\nBut for Thomas Sorensen making a series of world class saves in Melbourne City's 2-1 derby win last week, the Victory would have snapped their run of losses already. In truth, Melbourne created enough chances to win two or three matches and with a strike-force led by Besart Berisha, Fahid Ben Khalfallah and Kosta Barbarouses, it won't be long before they are back to winning ways.\n\nIndeed, that time could come this Sunday when they take on an illness-struck Perth Glory. Coach Kenny Lowe and captain Richard Garcia have both missed training sessions this week due to a virus, which does not bode well for the eighth-placed Glory.\n\nAs the saying goes, form is temporary, class is permanent. Plenty of class was shown in defeat by Melbourne Victory last week; it's only a matter of time before good form comes with it.\n\nMelbourne Victory fans have had little to cheer about recently.\n\n3. City and Roar set for spectacular clash\n\nMelbourne City last week showed they are more than capable of mixing it with the best teams in the league, but this Sunday they will face perhaps their greatest challenge yet away to Brisbane Roar.\n\nLast time these two teams met at Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane coach John Aloisi labelled City's performance as \"anti-football,\" condemning John van't Schip's side for defending deep and refusing to push forward.\n\nOn this occasion, City travel north to Queensland full of confidence having won their past four matches, scoring 16 goals in the process. The Roar also have a spring in their step, picking up two wins on the bounce to put them into second spot -- a position City can attain if they can win on the road.\n\nGiven the recent history between these two sides and their respective form of late, this promises to be one of the clashes of the round. Set aside some Christmas leftovers and tune into what should be a Boxing Day classic.\n\n4. Holosko hoodoo-breaker overshadowed\n\nAs mentioned in last week's column, Sydney FC coach Graham Arnold has been reprimanded for comments he has made in the press. This has unfortunately taken the limelight away from marquee man Filip Holosko, who broke his goal drought in impressive fashion in a 1-1 draw against Wellington Phoenix last week.\n\nGiven Holosko's recent woes in front of goal, this normally would have been cause for celebration, but a late Wellington equaliser, plus Arnold's scolding, has taken the shine off the Slovakian's strike. This is a real shame for the Sky Blues, who are in desperate need of some momentum heading into the holiday season.\n\nSydney have picked up just seven points in as many games following a strong start to the campaign. This dip in form -- particularly in the front third -- has seen Arnold's side drop to fourth on the table, six points behind rivals Western Sydney.\n\nOn Boxing Day, Sydney FC will face the hapless Central Coast Mariners and Arnold will be hoping he stays out of the headlines this time around for what should be a comfortable victory\n\n5. Wellington eager to keep touch with leaders\n\nErnie Merrick and his side impressed throughout the opening rounds with an expansive, attacking game plan. Ignited by Michael McGlinchey, Roly Bonevacia and Roy Krishna, Wellington have continued to play with attack in mind, but have failed to capitalise on their chances.\n\nA run of one win in five matches has resulted in the Phoenix slipping away from the competition frontrunners and if results don't go their way this week, they could fall out of the top six.\n\nIn Wellington's way this Saturday will be a resurgent Adelaide United, who have put a horror start to the campaign behind them to go three games unbeaten. Though the Reds lack the offensive arsenal of the Phoenix, coach Guillermo Amor will have his charges inspired to finish 2015 on a high.\n\nRob Brooks is a former Newcastle Jets and Central Coast Mariners media officer who joined the ESPN FC team in 2011.

While Torino were forced to play with only 10 men for practically the entire second half, they were convincingly defeated by a Bianconeri side that indulged in squad rotation, demonstrating the variety of skill that manager Massimiliano Allegri has at his disposal.\n\nOpting to give Daniele Rugani his first start for the Bianconeri, the young defender touted to be the future of Italy's defence played a mature game at the back. Level-headed and elegant, what most impressed the critics was how well the youngster adapted to the tactics. Well-versed in the art of defending as part of a four-man backline, the ex-Empoli star proved that he could also manage as part of a three-man backline. Required to cover more ground, he remained concentrated and calm as he batted away Torino's attacking threats.\n\nJuventus Juventus Torino Torino 4 0 FT Game Details Lineups and Stats\n\nGrateful and eager to learn, Rugani will be the man Juventus will focus on for years to come, for he not only boasts intelligence and talent, but the type of character that belongs at a big club. Humble, a quiet leader and a man uninterested in the glamour of the sport, Rugani simply wants to play and win, reminding fans of another great man who once captained Juve, the great Gaetano Scirea. While it's still early days and it remains to be seen whether the defender will grow and develop even further, the fans hope the player will be offered more playing time to ensure his progression.\n\nAnother player who excelled was Simone Zaza, a forward largely under appreciated by this blog. It must be said that the player has his limitations, as evidenced in the early part of the match. Almost too desperate to make an impression and not elegant enough to navigate the tough moments, Zaza earned a yellow card early in the match and came close to getting another later on. Yet after the initial madness, onlookers saw why the Turin giants believe in the ex-Sassuolo striker, for he demonstrated great technical ability in the 28th minute when he volleyed Alvaro Morata's cross to secure the opening goal of the game, then scoring his second goal six minutes into the second half.\n\nSimone Zaza was one of several Juventus players who made the most of a rare start in the Coppa win vs. Torino.\n\nHe still not a player capable of leading the line for a big club, but as the third or fourth-choice striker, the Old Lady would be hard pressed to find a better alternative. Furthermore, his performance on Wednesday proved that perhaps with a little more experience and a bit more continuity, the forward can mature and progress, learning how to play for the team in a more composed manner. Of course, certain individuals will always excel when they are surrounded by hard working teammates and in Morata, Zaza had the perfect partner.\n\nThe Spaniard has suffered as of late, culminating in a blunt performance against Sevilla in the final Champions League group clash. However, against Torino in the Coppa Italia, the youngster toiled and laboured, showing how much of a team player he really can be when he gives his all in a match. Working immensely hard to keep possession of the ball, it was Morata who helped create Juve's first goal -- one that was perfectly finished off by Zaza. While his finishing is still not at the level expected, all Allegri can really ask for are determined performances from Morata and the goals will eventually come.\n\nSo, it was a wonderful performance and another fine win for the Bianconeri. The players have not only fully immersed themselves in the team, playing with maturity and a winning mentality, but they have also understood the meaning of \"Stile Juve\". Both Paul Pogba and Paulo Dybala lifted their jerseys up after scoring on Wednesday evening to reveal heartwarming messages on their t-shirts underneath. Dybala dedicated his goal to \"Ale e' Ricky\", Alessio Ferramosca and Riccardo Nero, the two Bianconeri youth team players who drowned in 2006, while Pogba dedicated his perfect free-kick to Bryan, an 11-year-old Juventus fan suffering from cancer.\n\nThis side, like so many others before it, have seemingly grasped the importance of this particular jersey and if they manage another win against Carpi on Sunday, then few would bet against them pushing Inter to their limits in their quest to win another league title.\n\nMina Rzouki appears on BBC 5live, BBC Sportsworld, BT Sports, CNN, ESPN and Football Espana.

It quickly gained traction on social media, \"proof\" that United fans wanted the Portuguese as their boss to replace a failing Louis van Gaal.\n\nThe truth was more prosaic. A lone merchandise seller -- \"grafter\" in Mancunian parlance -- was hawking scarves bearing Mourinho's name and a version of the Manchester United badge. Some tourists were buying them, too, but while it fuelled rumours, it was one man with a bag of 100 scarves in a crowd of 75,000.\n\nManchester United Manchester United Chelsea Chelsea 0 0 FT Game Details GameCast\n\nLineups and Stats\n\nFans talked of Van Gaal's future and their failing side before the match. Online polls show most do want change, but the reality on the ground is less clear. If fans want change, they're reluctant to push for it at matches. It's part respect for the current manager, who they see it as their duty to support, part wanting United to value longevity and not be a club of quick changes and short-termism.\n\n\"I used to laugh at Man City changing their manager every year; we all did,\" opined Lance Manock, a Mancunian who sells souvenirs (but no Mourinho scarves) where Sir Matt Busby Way meets Sir Alex Ferguson Way. There are currently no plans for a Louis van Gaal Way. \"We shouldn't become the same. Managers should be given time, and Mourinho isn't the answer here. What will we get? Two good years and then a blowout in the third?\"\n\nFans don't pretend that the football under Van Gaal is anything but boring, but they also don't like to see a man condemned who enjoyed widespread support only a month ago.\n\nWhile the now infamous Jose Mourinho scarves made the rounds on social media pre-match, they did not generally reflect the mood among Manchester United supporters.\n\nBy the entrance to the Munich tunnel, stewards in bright orange and yellow jackets ushered 3,000 travelling Chelsea fans into their turnstiles to watch their injury- and suspension-hit strugglers. They'd soon be singing \"Jose Mourinho\" in honour of their recently dismissed manager. Security was tight, more so since the terror attacks in Paris.\n\nMembers of United's Disabled Supporters club waited by an entrance close to where executive supporters were greeted by attractive ladies in Manchester United suits. Sean Jeffrey, a 21-year-old with learning disabilities from Hyde near Manchester wondered who would replace Van Gaal, if he were to go. Most United fans did the same. Sean's father was sympathetic. \"Van Gaal doesn't look well, he doesn't need it at his age, it's not fair on him,\" he opined.\n\nA suited Van Gaal made his entrance alongside his team. Like a wounded prizefighter, he was applauded and he waved at the crowd in the South Stand. Twenty-four photographers focused their lenses on the United manager as he took his place on his seat surrounded by fans. Despite many fans wanting a change of manager, there was no hostility, no season tickets hurled in frustration.\n\nNot for the first time this season, United started brightly, with Juan Mata striking the crossbar with a second-minute shot. He'd been set up by Wayne Rooney, recalled after being a substitute in the previous game, a defeat at Stoke. The noise increased, and fans who'd been singing for Van Gaal in the Stretford End hollered about following United. Their team showed a purpose that had been lacking, though John Terry's fourth-minute header was goalbound until United goalkeeper David De Gea tipped it over. At least it was exciting.\n\nEmbattled Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal was optimistic before Monday's clash with Chelsea.\n\n\"Viva John Terry!\" sang the Stretford End, serenading the Chelsea captain with their song celebrating his penalty slip in the 2008 European Cup final between the clubs. In the match programme, former United captain Nemanja Vidic recalled that game seven years ago when the pair were the best teams in the world.\n\n\"Chelsea were the team who pushed us, and we pushed them,\" the Serb said. \"We drove each other on. In the league, in the cups, in Europe.\"\n\nOn current form, both sides are far from being England's best, let alone continental or world beaters, but United did show an urgency that has been lacking for most of this season in a very bright opening half hour.\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin's ninth-minute shot rasped wide of Thibaut Courtois' goal, prompting more chants of \"Louis van Gaal's red and white army\" in J Stand.\n\nThere was further promise and evidence that confidence wasn't entirely depleted in the United ranks when Anthony Martial's shot struck the inside of the post. A 28th-minute Rooney shot from distance drew another save from the Belgian.\n\n\"It's so quiet, Old Trafford,\" chorused the visiting fans during a brief lull. They also chided United fans for playing their European football on Thursday evening for the rest of the season after Champions League elimination.\n\n\"Going down,\" responded the home hordes.\n\n\"Campeones,\" hit back the fans in blue, bringing a riposte of \"20 times\" to celebrate United's record 20 league titles. This was the terrace tribalism of English football at its finest, the mood bolstered by the performance of the home team. It was encouraging, but without a goal their confidence always appeared fragile, the attack still lacking a killer instinct.\n\nAt the start of the second half, De Gea made a double save from Pedro and then Cesar Azpilicueta. At the other end, Courtois saved from Ander Herrera from close range after Martial had crossed.\n\nManchester United played some of their best football in weeks, but were still unable to find a way past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.\n\nNeither team could score. When Chelsea counterattacked on the hour after Pedro put Nemanja Matic through with only De Gea to beat, the champions looked sure to go ahead and sink United's confidence. Instead, the Serb skied his shot into a sea of waving, mocking arms. Chelsea were without a striker, and it showed.\n\nUnited's early flourish faded and gave way to their mundane usual selves, albeit with more attacking intent. Their conservatism unshackled, they played like a side who weren't used to playing in this way. United gave the ball away, they conceded foul throws and made unforced errors. They moved the ball too slowly, misjudged movement and, most importantly, failed to score again.\n\nWhen the stadium announcer indicated a minimum of three minutes of added time, the announcement wasn't greeted with primal screams for United to attack. Instead, there was weariness from fans watching their side draw 0-0 at home for the sixth time in 15 games this season. They hoped for more, but, when it mattered, their team didn't have the players capable of breaking down an injury-hit side who sit 15th. There were muted jeers and applause at the end from a minority. The rest trudged away reluctantly into an unseasonably mild northern English night.\n\n\"I see the Stretford End arising, I see there's trouble on the way,\" sang the residents of the famous stand during the game.

If Manchester City beat Dynamo Kiev and then the winner of the Gent vs. Wolfsburg clash to get to the semifinals, it won't mean they're necessarily a better team (or that Manuel Pellegrini is a better manager) than they were last season, when they ran into future Treble-winners Barcelona.\n\nWe've said it before, but it bears repeating: Results are only part of assessing a team and its manager's progress.\n\nMore problems for Real Madrid\n\nRafa Benitez needed this like he needed a hole in the head. Real Madrid traveled to take on Villarreal on the back of the 8-0 squashing of Malmo and, perhaps buoyed by that stat-padding, garbage-time performance, their manager lined up a side constructed to treat the yellow submarine like a pinata.\n\nToni Kroos was on the bench, Casemiro protected the back four and, from right to left, Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez, Luka Modric and Cristiano Ronaldo queued up to exact damage behind Karim Benzema.\n\nAnd why not? Villarreal had won two of eight Liga games since September. What better way to exploit the momentum of the \"Malmo Crazyeights\" performance than by going for the jugular from the first minute?\n\nIf Benitez is superstitious, he probably realized early on that it wasn't going to be his day. After eight minutes, Roberto Soldado, who hadn't scored in La Liga since August, notched his 10th league goal since June 2013. Thereafter, the first half wasn't just uphill; it was up the face of Ayers Rock. Other than James Rodriguez, Madrid's front five ranged from the ethereal to the ineffective.\n\nESPN FC's Steve Nicol says that he isn't ready to give up on Real Madrid this season, but they will need a new manager.\n\nThe second half wasn't much better as the visitors gave up playing and moved to a shoot-on-sight policy, perhaps forgetting that the point of passing is to get better shot locations. The final count, by the way, had Real Madrid outshooting Villarreal 20-7, but managing just a single strike on target.\n\nThe result leaves them five points behind the joint leaders Atletico Madrid and Barcelona. It also leaves them with the worst point total after 15 games of any Madrid side since 2008-09, when Bernd Schuster was replaced by Juande Ramos.\n\nThe blame will be dumped on Benitez, no doubt, though Marcelo and Pepe both said the players need to look at themselves first and foremost.\n\nYou wonder how many people will look beyond coach and squad to the folks responsible -- for the second year running -- of putting together an ill-assorted team where the pieces don't fit.\n\nGiroud and Ramsey step up\n\nSome expected Arsenal to melt away following injuries to Santi Cazorla, Francis Coquelin and Alexis Sanchez, which added to an already copious list of unavailable players, which includes Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck.\n\nInstead, others have stepped up, such as the returning Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud. It's a bit curious given that Giroud, in some quarters, had been identified as the main culprit for Arsenal's inability to turn their huge amount of final third possession into goals.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramsey was supposedly stuck in that dangerous neither-fish-nor-fowl situation: less effective out wide than in the middle, but less effective than Cazorla in terms of distributing from a central role.\n\nThe ESPN FC crew discuss who they believe will win the English Premier League based on the current form of the teams.\n\nGiroud has seen 1264 minutes of Premier League and Champions' League action this season and has scored 13 goals, all but two of which have come from open play. That's an average of nearly a goal every 90 minutes and, when you throw in the fact that he's an effective passer, a penalty box presence and a tireless worker, it's a pretty good overall package.\n\nRamsey was impressive in Arsenal's 2-0 win at Aston Villa (OK, so it's only Villa, but still). He was asked to play the Cazorla position and he played it differently. To use a basketball analogy, he's not a point guard; he's a slasher with the ability to make well-timed runs into shooting positions. But that's fine. The fact that he can function there effectively means Arsenal are more multi-faceted than some gave them credit for.\n\nMan United's bad week and Van Gaal's choices\n\nManchester United's defeat at Bournemouth makes it five games on the spin in all competitions without a victory. (And, if you're keeping score, the last game they did win -- away to Watford -- came courtesy of a dramatic own goal in injury time.) United haven't gone this many games without a win since the last millennium.\n\nTruth be told, despite the many absentees, United were no worse against Bournemouth than in previous outings and probably should have come away with at least a point. David De Gea made an uncharacteristic blunder and conceded goal direct from a corner, United's forwards missed some clear-cut chances, the back four were awful and that was that.\n\nBut there are two factors that, perhaps, are worth picking out. One is United's \"institutional\" reaction. After last week's elimination from the Champions League, they held one of their background briefings, telling The Times that they were working to put together deals to sign one of Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo or Neymar.\n\nNow, they've been linked to all three before, so that wasn't perhaps earth-shattering news but what struck you though was the timing, which is straight out of a PR consultant's handbook. We'll give you this huge exclusive so that you all talk a little more about who we might sign and a little less about the fact that we came up short in the Champions League. That's the modus operandi coming out of Old Trafford these days.\n\nOf course, they also tempered everything by pointing out just how tough it would be to sign any of those three, which was in keeping with the familiar narrative of how the Premier League is just so competitive and physical because little teams don't \"lie down\" for the big boys.\n\nA direct quote from a \"senior United source\" said: \"They know that if they play in La Liga they can score 40 or more goals, but in the Premier League you're probably looking at 20 to 25.\"\n\nIt's hard to know where to begin with the inanity of that statement. Maybe the fact that two of those three guys have never even come close to scoring 40 goals in La Liga: Bale's best is 15 and Neymar's is 22.\n\nThe broader point, though, is that you're basically saying one reason that it's tough to sign those players is because their personal stats would be less gaudy in England. The obvious riposte to that is asking -- assuming all of this is true, which it probably isn't -- why you'd want guys who'd rather pad their stats than be part of a successful sporting project.\n\nThe ESPN FC panel give their thoughts on Louis van Gaal's future following Manchester United's 'inexcusable' loss at Bournemouth.\n\nThe other curious takeaway from United's weekend was the way Louis Van Gaal dealt with United's injury crisis (plus Bastian Schweinsteiger's suspension).\n\nHe made a conscious decision to throw in the kids: Cameron Borthwick-Jackson and Guillermo Varela from the start, Andreas Pereira and Nick Powell off the bench. Those four, between them, had played 135 minutes of top-flight league football in their entire careers. (People have lumped Paddy McNair in as well, but while he's still just 20, he at least played a significant amount last year)\n\nMake no mistake about it, this was a choice. Because while it's true that United were missing Matteo Darmian, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling at the back, it's equally true that Van Gaal could have turned to his bunch and played a back four of Phil Jones, Daley Blind, McNair and Ashley Young. Indeed, Morgan Schneiderlin could have played at right-back, a role he's filled before.\n\nIt's a legitimate choice and surely Van Gaal has his reasons. But it's also a hugely counterintuitive decision to take, especially at this time, and it's one that could backfire. If you're Young or Jones or Schneiderlin and you can't even get on the pitch when 11 guys are unavailable, what does it say about the manager's faith in your abilities?\n\nChicharito keeps on scoring\n\nJust to rub it in further, the \"Chicharito show\" continues at Bayer Leverkusen. On Saturday, Javier Hernandez hit a hat trick in a 5-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach (which also put an end to Andre Schubert's 10-game unbeaten run and, perhaps, the debate over whether the coach really has mystical powers.)\n\nSome -- including yours truly and I have no problem admitting I was wrong -- were skeptical about whether Hernandez was a good fit for Roger Schmidt's system but 17 goals in 20 games tell their own story.\n\nAnd, yes, for those keeping score at home, that's one less than Memphis Depay, Anthony Martial and Wayne Rooney have notched -- combined -- for Manchester United in all competitions.\n\nBarcelona's progress is checked\n\nWe sort of took it for granted following Barcelona's 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid in el Clasico and the subsequent 6-1 win against Roma but now, all of a sudden following the 2-2 draw against Deportivo La Coruna, it's three games without a win. And that's something which is unprecedented in the Luis Enrique era.\n\nTake it with a grain of salt. Against Valencia, the first of the draws, Barcelona dominated against an injury-riddled side, only for Paco Alcacer and Santi Mina to magic up a late equalizer.\n\nFour days later, the side that drew at the BayArena against Leverkusen was basically a B-team -- no disrespect to Sergi Samper and Wilfrid Kaptoum -- with an extra Lionel Messi, Jordi Alba and Ivan Rakitic spliced on top.\n\nThe ESPN FC team discuss Barcelona's 2-2 draw with Deportivo over the weekend, after leading the game 2-0.\n\nBut Saturday's result does have some relevance. Other than the absent Neymar, this was basically the first XI and the game was at the Camp Nou. Depor are no pushover but, for most of the game it was business as usual, Barca went 2-0 up and should have extended their lead but for a blown offside call on a disallowed Luis Suarez goal.\n\nThe worry came at the end when Gerard Pique and Javier Mascherano went flaccid in defence and Depor scored twice in the last 20 minutes.\n\nWhat you don't want if you're Luis Enrique is for Barca to fall into the kind self-indulgence where they start to believe their own hype and pay a price. Odds are, this will be a mini wake-up call and it won't happen.\n\nJuventus have a familiar look\n\nThe current Juventus team are increasingly reminiscent of Antonio Conte's first bianconeri side.\n\nSure, there are obvious differences, starting with the quality of the forwards (no disrespect to Alessandro Matri, Mirko Vucinic and Fabio Quagliarella but Alvaro Morata, Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic are on another level). And, of course, Paul Pogba plays the game differently than Andrea Pirlo, while Sami Khedira won't be mistaken for Arturo Vidal anytime soon.\n\nBut there is a resilience and an intensity to this team that's reminiscent of Conte's blue-collar masterpiece. Against Fiorentina -- a trap game -- Juve went a goal down early, equalized straight away and then proceeded to chip away at La Viola, with a sort of relentless patience.\n\nESPN FC's Gab Marcotti breaks down the best of the Serie A weekend which featured wins for Inter Milan and Juventus.\n\nThe goals that won the game came late, thanks to Mandzukic (if Conte had been a striker, that's who he would have been) and the magnificent Dybala. But there was an air of controlled intensity throughout, a sense that sooner or later they were going to break through.\n\nThat makes it six wins in a row in Serie A for the side now managed by Max Allegri and the gap with the pace-setters has been nearly halved, from 11 points to six. There are three sides ahead of Juventus and Napoli and Inter especially also appear to have another gear.\n\nBut this Juve team are coming on strong and, as the warning goes: \"Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.\"\n\nKlopp's post-game actions cause debate\n\nNot everyone is happy with Jurgen Klopp right now. Taking his players to salute the Liverpoool fans after a 2-2 home draw against West Bromwich Albion seemed somewhat corny. It may be commonplace in Germany and elsewhere, but you do it after an impressive display (which this wasn't) or, at least, after winning (they didn't).\n\nHaving listened to Klopp's explanation-- he wanted to thank the supporters, particularly after criticizing some for leaving early in previous games -- you can see where he's come from. He's trying to galvanize Anfield and, to be fair, while the atmosphere there is often more raucous than elsewhere in England, at most Premier League grounds it's rather tame and corporate.\n\nThis is part of Klopp's schtick and part of what made him such a success in Dortmund -- that ability to connect with fans and truly get them to be active participants in a game. If he thinks it will help, let him do it. If anything, there's often not enough public acknowledgement from players for the people who actually pay their wages.\n\nThe ESPN FC crew have their own opinions to the Klopp-led celebrations at Anfield after their 1-1 draw with West Brom.\n\nSomewhat less endearing was his snub of Tony Pulis' handshake at full-time. To his credit, Klopp didn't shy away from the issue: \"We had some words in the game and sometimes it takes more than a few seconds to cool down. Usually I shake hands. It was not a friendly game.\"\n\nThe handshake between managers has become something between traditional and ritual and some would say that, if it isn't heartfelt, why go through with it and engage in an empty gesture?\n\nWell, it's not empty; it's part of the custom. And, in fact, we've seen so many perfunctory and half-hearted handshakes over the years that only a fool would think that the two men always respect each other simply because they shake.\n\nBut the meaning goes beyond that. It's a sign of respect not so much for the other manager as a person, but for the role he represents. Dare I say it, snubbing Pulis was not very Klopp-like.\n\nPSG must guard against complacency\n\nGoing into the season, there were very few games in Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 schedule where you could imagine them possibly dropping points.\n\nLyon at home was one but, instead, we got a one-sided display that underscored just why PSG have nearly twice as many points in the table as their opponents. Lyon lost 5-1 and the one was courtesy of Kevin Trapp who, though he remains first-choice PSG goalkeeper ahead of Salvatore Sirigu, hasn't exactly been an upgrade this season.\n\nHaving won 15 of their 18 games so far, Laurent Blanc's side are on pace to break the 100-point barrier. They are 17 points clear of the two teams in second, surprise package Angers and Monaco, and have scored more -- 45-42 -- than the two of them combined.\n\nAt this rate, PSG could almost have the title wrapped up by February, just in time to take on Chelsea in the Champions' League.\n\nAt some point, the challenge for Blanc will be keeping everybody on their toes.\n\nRoma's Garcia makes his point\n\nTo every action, there's a reaction, right?\n\nWhen you don't win in more than a month and generally play poorly, a manager's first instinct is to hunker down and close up shop at the back. That's what Roma's Rudi Garcia did in Naples and the result was a 0-0 draw which, in terms of points, hurts Napoli more than it helps Roma (in the sense that it won't exactly get the Ultras off their back).\n\nRoma contrived to not get a single shot on target, something which had not happened in seven seasons. Napoli huffed and puffed, but against a side that raises the barricades with a whole assembly line full of parked buses, there's only so much you can do.\n\nNapoli can't let the result get to them. They're still second and, in this topsy-turvy Serie A season there will be plenty more opportunities.\n\nAs for Roma, maybe Garcia will be proved right; it was all about steadying the ship. That's fine against Napoli away, but come next Sunday and the visit of Genoa, the giallorossi will have to turn in an entirely different performance. Otherwise, they'll be back to square one.\n\nGabriele Marcotti is a columnist for ESPN FC, The Times and Corriere dello Sport. Follow him on Twitter @Marcotti."}
