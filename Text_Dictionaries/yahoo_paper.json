Jaguars at Saints, Sunday, 4:05, O/U 52: First of all, Happy Holidays! It\u2019s too early to know if Drew Brees ($34) will play with his foot injury. But he says he expects to. Blake Bortles ($36) should be golden against the awful Saints defense. Brandin Cooks ($26) is an interesting story in that people want to point to the emergence of other weapons as giving him the opening to thrive. I think that\u2019s the kind of story we look for, but Cooks\u2019 emergence is probably just random variance disguised as something more meaningful. In other words, a story that could have been divined. Watch out for this kind of thinking.\n\n2. Packers at Cardinals, Sunday, 4:25, O/U 49.5: I could talk about David Johnson ($21) all day. He was a zeroRB pick in my preseason column. But only zeroRB would have kept me safely away from Eddie Lacy ($21). Last week, I wrote here that the stage was set for him to break hearts because he\u2019s a completely unreliable player and the comments killed me. I can see Lacy having a big day now, infuriating his owners whose seasons ended last week due to him. You know, just to rub it in.\n\n3. Redskins at Eagles, Saturday, 8:25, O/U 48: I guess I have to eat some crow on Kirk Cousins ($32), who has been good in reality and is at least streamable in fantasy. Most QBs are streamable in fantasy. I want to make fun of Luck owners for blowing up their seasons but they probably don\u2019t even see it because they replaced Luck so easily and conclude that his loss didn\u2019t hurt him. But it was the early round pick that they deep fried due to a process era (early round QB) when it\u2019s hard enough to walk away from a draft with good early picks even when you play the game right.\n\n[More rankings: Quarterback | Running Back | Receiver | Tight End | Flex | All Positions]\n\n4. Panthers at Falcons, Sunday, 1:00, O/U 47.5: The Panthers are going to play hard for history. But their schedule is the third softest in football according to Pro-Football-Reference and while winning is impressive no matter what, the idea that this is an all-time team is total nonsense. They won\u2019t even be favored if they get the Seahawks in their first postseason game. I got a lot of heat last week for writing that Cam Newton ($35) has been a relatively ineffective runner but you all have to recognize how to separate the descriptive like that piece from the predictive like this one.\n\n5. Steelers at Ravens, Sunday, 1:00, O/U 47.5: I guess Vegas figures the Steelers are going to score about 35. Yeah, I know that if you extrapolate the line the expected score is 29-19. But a Pittsburgh explosion is never surprising. Markus Wheaton ($16) is absolutely playable in a championship game, say if Alshon Jeffery ($27) is out. I liked him this summer only because Ben Roethlisberger ($34) praised him. Most dismissed him as a player. And they seemed right but oddly, with all the receivers healthy, Wheaton is getting about 9 targets, 90 yards and a TD on average the last four weeks. And he looks good, too, at least to my eye. The idea that Roethlisberger had some corporate reason to unjustly praise Wheaton always seemed ludicrous to me.\n\n[Don\u2019t miss Yahoo\u2019s NBA free roll on Christmas. Join our $25K Stocking Stuffer Contest]\n\nMiddle Ground\n\n6. Bears at Buccaneers, Sunday, 1:00, O/U 46: Jameis Winston is the worst QB in the football when it comes to poor throw rate. But he is making longer throws on average and of course may be throwing more passes than average away since he\u2019s pretty good at avoiding sacks. What do we do with Jeffery next year? I have no idea. He needs to play through these next two games or his free-agent status is going to be severely compromised and, similarly, his 2016 fantasy ranking, too.\n\n7. Patriots at Jets, Sunday, 1:00, O/U 45.5: Tom Brady is left with nothing on offense. He\u2019s playing a guy who looks like a guard at running back. I can\u2019t see Julian Edelman ($27) coming back before the end of the season. Steven Jackson is back at running back. See that preseason piece for evidence that last year he wasn\u2019t actually that bad in play success rate. Eric Decker ($27) is amazing \u2014 10 TDs without ever having more than one in a game. All those yards with one 100-yard game. He\u2019s the most underrated player in football and the most projectable receiver this year in the history of fantasy football. And Ryan Fitzpatrick ($32) is like him at QB. New England is going to have big trouble scoring in this game.\n\n8. Giants at Vikings, Sunday, 8:30, O/U 45.5: I assume Odell Beckham Jr.\u2019s suspension will be upheld but who knows. Similarly, Adrian Peterson ($34) is going to be limited by an ankle injury, but you want him playing against this embarrassingly bad Giants defense if he\u2019s even breathing. Forget about Teddy Bridgewater and Stefon Diggs ($13) with that kind of passing volume (20 attempts last week) and playing pace in a game like this that Minnesota should win. Volume is the only thing that\u2019s actually bettable. If someone is hyper efficient (Diggs for example had four targets last week), you can\u2019t have any regrets because you played right.\n\nDefensive battles\n\n9. 49ers at Lions, Sunday, 1:00, O/U 43: Calvin Johnson ($28) is what receiver next year? He\u2019s the 14th now in 0.75 PPR, between Decker (13th) and Maclin. Man, the guff you guys gave me for saying that Decker was a top 20 receiver, like I\u2019m some Jets homer (being a fan does not make you a homer). I did not think that was even some daring projection. His ADP this year was a complete joke. Scott Pianowski and most I know in the industry were on this yet it did not change.\n\n10. Cowboys at Bills, Sunday, 1:00, O/U 43: Sammy Watkins ($24) is WR24 this year. That\u2019s about where I\u2019ll rank him next year but that will never get him and that\u2019s okay. People will look at Watkins\u2019 draft pedigree and always see the glass as half full but you can\u2019t make money overpaying on what guys actually did and parsing stats based on games missed or injuries that we know are predictive of future injuries. The Bills have not made the playoffs for 16 straight years, one off the post-merger record.\n\n11. Browns at Chiefs, Sunday, 1:00, O/U 43: Johnny Manziel ($23) looked great last week until he did not. The Browns won\u2019t learn anything about him. So this year was wasted. Duke Johnson has six points less in 0.75 PPR this full season than Jeremy Hill. Don\u2019t pay for running backs, kids.\n\n12. Rams at Seahawks, Sunday, 4:25, O/U 40.5: Russell Wilson ($36) the first QB in NFL history with five straight games with 3-plus touchdowns and zero picks. He and Doug Baldwin ($31) are a late-blooming passing combo to be sure. But you can\u2019t treat Baldwin like he\u2019s a no-talent. The guy makes plays and his lack of size isn\u2019t that big a deal, I learned this summer to my chagrin. (Receivers are no better than average when having a huge \u2014 4-plus-inch \u2014 height advantage and are, in fact, worse.)\n\n13. Bengals at Broncos, Monday, 8:30, O/U 40.5: Will Peyton Manning ($26) play? I hope so. One of the worst things about this year was the joy that people took in Manning\u2019s declining, injury-plagued play. Peyton has more than perhaps any other player made the NFL must-see TV for nearly 20 years.\n\n14. Colts at Dolphins, Sunday, 1:00, O/U NL: And thus continues the backup QB section of our Week 16 slate. Why don\u2019t the Dolphins play Lamar Miller ($28) more? Well he\u2019s the fourth-highest scoring running back this year so what did you expect? Okay, he\u2019s 65 points behind the No. 1 back, Devonta Freeman ($32), but that\u2019s still what six points a week? And if you want a back like Freeman you know you have to pay up\u2026. Oh, right. (I HATED Freeman by the way.)\n\n\n\n15. Texans at Titans, Sunday, 1:00, O/U NL: I like Zach Mettenberger ($25) as a guy you should be able to trade for cheap in the offseason. He has rare arm talent and hasn\u2019t been bad so take a shot. Maybe the Texans can get him. We\u2019re about to test the limits of ($31) DeAndre Hopkins\u2019 value with Brandon Weeden ($21) throwing him the rock.", "Mostly NFL Notes: Talking Blake Bortles and a look back at Week 16": "Over his last eight games, Brandin Cooks has produced a season\u2019s pace of 1,344 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns. He\u2019ll easily be a top-10 fantasy WR entering 2016. Speed kills...Blake Bortles continued his trend of racking up fantasy points after getting off to a slow start, but it all counts the same to his owners. The Jags were held scoreless against a historically bad defense until less than two minutes were left in the first half, but Bortles finished with 368 passing yards and four touchdowns (and a two point conversion). An afterthought at drafts, he's now on pace to finish with 4,468 passing yards and 37 touchdowns (adding 331 rushing yards and two scores on the ground)...The previous NFL record for touchdown passes allowed in a season was 40. The Saints have now yielded 43 with a game left to play...Allen Robinson went off for another 151 yards and is now up to 14 touchdowns on the year, including this 90-yarder Sunday. He didn\u2019t make the Pro Bowl.\n\nDenard Robinson fumbled, had a drop and ran for just 20 yards in the most favorable matchup for running backs there is, although he did add 51 receiving yards. Still, I had him as an easy top-10 RB this week...Julius Thomas was even more disappointing, as he saw just two targets for 12 yards against a New Orleans defense that had allowed by far the most fantasy points to opposing tight ends...Tim Hightower racked up 169 yards from scrimmage with two touchdowns and was the source of many fantasy championships in Week 16. After not having played since 2011, he\u2019s seen at least 29 touches in two of his past three games...Props to Drew Brees for playing through such a serious foot injury in a lost season, and he continues to be a dominant force at home.\n\nRyan Tannehill got 8.7 YPA, but that resulted in zero touchdowns, and he lost 50 yards on six sacks. He\u2019s been a major disappointment this season and doesn\u2019t look like the team\u2019s long term answer at quarterback...I\u2019d be surprised if Miami doesn\u2019t turn to Jay Ajayi as its main back next year, letting Lamar Miller walk...Frank Gore looked like one of the better players on the field Sunday, highlighted by this impressive TD run... I\u2019ll be ranking DaVante Parker ahead of Jarvis Landry next year, although the latter did haul in this sick catch Sunday.\n\nKirk Cousins committed the worst gaffe I\u2019ve ever seen, but over the last seven games, he has a 73.2 completion percentage with a 9.3(!) YPA and a 16:2 TD:INT ratio (with three rushing scores). He should enter 2016 as easily a top-10 fantasy QB.\n\nJohnny Manziel ran for nearly as many yards (108) as he threw (136), which I\u2019m guessing hasn\u2019t happened many other times...Since starting 1-5, the Chiefs have won nine straight and have clinched a playoff spot before the Broncos...Cleveland forced its first turnover since Week 12, and just after Kevin Harlan stated Travis Coons has had all three of his \u201clong\u201d field goal attempts blocked this season, KC proceeded to block its first one since 2012.\n\nFacing a Baltimore secondary that entered with a 28:4 TD:INT ratio, Ben Roethlisberger somehow finished with zero touchdowns and two interceptions, and he\u2019s lucky another 100-yard pick-six was called back thanks to someone lining up in the neutral zone. It was a truly baffling performance with the playoffs on the line after Pittsburgh shredded the league\u2019s best defense last week...Baltimore came in having allowed the most fantasy points to opposing wide receivers, ceding an NFL-high 25 touchdowns, so I didn\u2019t expect Martavis Bryant to grab one catch for six yards.\n\nThis knockout was pretty legit.\n\nThe Texans started 1-4, lost Arian Foster early on and are using their fourth quarterback of the season yet are now the favorites to be the No. 4 seed in the AFC...Harry Douglas, Delanie Walker and Anthony Fasano combined for 34 targets. Dorial Green-Beckham saw three...Antonio Andrews caught zero of two targets and gained one yard on two carries while losing a fumble that was returned for a touchdown in an epic performance.\n\nComing off two games in which he had just one catch, Calvin Johnson saw 10 targets, an amount he\u2019s exceeded just once since Week 4. Still, Megatron will clearly be downgraded further on draft sheets next year...No player rushed for 75 yards or recorded 80 receiving yards in this game that totaled 49 points...Sunday marked the first time the 49ers scored a touchdown in the first quarter this season.\n\nMike Evans had another brutal drop on a would-be long touchdown, as it remains unclear if he\u2019s good at football...Matt Forte and Jeremy Langford combined for 33 touches, so naturally they scored zero touchdowns while Ka\u2019Deem Carey scored two...I love Alshon Jeffery\u2019s talent and situation, but considering his injury history, he won\u2019t be a top-10 WR on my board entering 2016...Here\u2019s Austin Seferian-Jenkins saving his fantasy day thanks to a hail mary...Doug Martin got 2.9 YPC and lost two more fumbles yet currently ranks second in the NFL in rushing yards. I\u2019d have no confidence drafting him next year.\n\nKellen Moore produced a 41.9 completion percentage, although he didn\u2019t take a sack. It\u2019s pretty funny Brandon Weeden, who was the first to replace Tony Romo this year in Dallas, might start a playoff game this season (although Brian Hoyer will hopefully be back soon enough)...Despite terrible QB play, over the past three games Darren McFadden has gotten 7.1 YPC...Tyrod Taylor had just four fewer rushing attempts (14) than passes...It has to be infuriating for Karlos Williams owners to get a home game against the Cowboys without LeSean McCoy in Week 16, only to see Mike Gillislee get the start and steal 11 touches.\n\nHeadlines of the Week: Knife-Wielding Santa Claus Robs KFC...Nicolas Cage Returns Stolen Dinosaur Skull He Bought...Japanese Man Dies Of Caffeine Intoxication...Virginia DMV Now Allowing Customers To Smile In License Photos...Fish In Bristol Lake To Be Killed To Deter Angling...Joyriding Monkey Steals Bus While Driver Sleeps.\n\nCameron Artis-Payne impressed last week and coaches suggested he\u2019d see even more work moving forward. Up against a Falcons defense that\u2019s allowed the fourth-most fantasy points against running backs, he sure seemed like a decent RB2, only to see Fozzy Whitaker start and get all the work early, as CAP finished with just five carries...Devonta Freeman hasn\u2019t reached 75 rushing yards in any of his past six games, and he hasn\u2019t reached 90 since Oct. 25. Of course, his work at the goal line and as a receiver have kept him plenty valuable. Freeman is going to be one of the trickier players to rank in next year\u2019s drafts...This Cam Newton run was ridiculous...Carolina had won 18 straight regular season games before losing Sunday. The 14-1 Panthers have been outscored by 32 points over the past 5.5 quarters...It was the Julio Jones show, as he tore apart a strong Carolina secondary, securing 9-of-11 targets (with one drop) for 178 yards and this touchdown catch that was the play of the day.\n\nAt age 31 and joining a new team, Brandon Marshall now has a career-high 13 touchdowns with Ryan Fitzpatrick as his quarterback and a teammate with 11 receiving scores of his own. Who didn\u2019t see that coming? Marshall and Eric Decker have scored in the same game an incredible eight times this season...There was talk about the Patriots actually wanting to lose Sunday for playoff reasons, and then after the Steelers lost, New England elected to kick after winning the coin toss in overtime and seemingly laid down and allowed a touchdown. I don\u2019t really believe this, but as someone who has a sizeable bet on Pittsburgh to win the Super Bowl, I\u2019m not totally ruling it out.\n\nSong of the Week: Grimes - Kill V. Maim\n\nCase Keenum threw for 103 yards, yet the Rams won by six points in Seattle...Kenny Britt burning Richard Sherman for a 28-yard touchdown wasn\u2019t exactly expected...Doug Baldwin is now up to 11 touchdowns over the last five games, and his 10 targets Sunday were somehow his most over that span. He\u2019s one of two wide receivers with 14 TDs on the year who didn\u2019t make the Pro Bowl...Seattle had gone 25 straight games with 100 rushing yards or more, but that came to an end thanks to Christine Michael and Bryce Brown totaling 15 yards on 13 carries. This had far more to do with the Seahawks\u2019 blocking and St. Louis\u2019 defense than either\u2019s skills, although a healthy Thomas Rawls is clearly the best player at the position on this team...Seattle had another streak end, as they entered having led an NFL-high 62 consecutive games but never did so Sunday...Todd Gurley getting 85 rushing yards (4.5 YPC) and a score against the toughest run defense was pretty impressive. He\u2019ll be a top-five pick next year.\n\nPolice Blotter: Taekwondo Teacher Arrested For Knocking Out A 5-Year-Old...Woman Arrested After Fighting With Husband Who Wouldn\u2019t Stop Farting...Impaired Zamboni Driver To Be Charged...Woman Bit Off Husband\u2019s Ear Over A Beer...13-Year-Old Leads Cops On High-Speed Chase.\n\nAaron Rodgers took eight sacks, got 5.4 YPA and committed three turnovers in a 30-point loss to the Cardinals. He lost more yards on sacks (70) than any Packers receiver gained...David Johnson is really good, and the lopsided score helped by two defensive touchdowns (including this one in which Eddie Lacy got embarrassed) really hurt his and Carson Palmer\u2019s fantasy owners...Davante Adams is really bad, and after not recording a single catch that went for double-digit yards over the past four games despite being the No. 2 receiver for a Rodgers led offense, he celebrated a nice gain by spiking the ball, resulting in an obvious 15-yard penalty...Michael Floyd should be ranked as a top-15 fantasy WR next year at minimum.\n\n\u201cMaking A Murderer\u201d is amazing and a must-watch. It\u2019s probably my favorite TV show of 2015 in a year that had great competition. Go watch it ASAP.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if losing Odell Beckham Jr. hurt the Giants\u2019 offense. Seriously, he\u2019s probably the most important player to his team who\u2019s not a quarterback (or named J.J. Watt)...Blair Walsh is now 32-of-37 on FG attempts and 31-of-35 on extra points this season...The Vikings scored 49 points despite not having a single player reach 60 receiving yards. In fact, Minnesota has averaged 43.5 points over its past two games, with Teddy Bridgewater averaging 22.5 pass attempts...The lopsided score Sunday night really hurt Adrian Peterson\u2019s fantasy owners, who watched aghast as Jerick McKinnon ran wild in the fourth quarter while rushing for two scores, including this one for 68 yards.

PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Wild goalie Devan Dubnyk had pain shooting up his arm during the morning skate, the result of a cut requiring stitches sustained the day before.\n\nHe was supposed to sit Monday night, but when Darcy Kuemper was a late scratch because of an upper-body injury, Dubnyk suited up.\n\nThe workhorse netminder made 28 saves, Mikko Koivu scored twice and the Wild beat the Detroit Red Wings 3-1 on Monday night.\n\n''When you get an opportunity to play as many games as (coach Mike Yeo has) allowed me to play over the last little while, it's easy to just get into game-day routine,'' Dubnyk said. ''Nothing really changes. It's not a big deal. It didn't feel real good this morning, but it felt a lot better tonight than I expected it to.''\n\nCharlie Coyle scored for the third time in four games for Minnesota. Koivu scored a power-play goal in the third and added an empty-net tally for the Wild, which had lost three of four.\n\nDetroit couldn't solve Dubnyk until Pavel Datsyuk scored his fourth goal of the season with just over 2 minutes remaining.

But Kuemper was announced out about an hour before the game, making Dubnyk the healthiest option among Minnesota's top two goaltenders.\n\nWhen he took the ice for the morning skate, Dubnyk wasn't sure he'd be available because of what he called ''nerve pain.'' He struggled to even get his hand in his blocker but said the needlework loosened up as the day went on.\n\n''I think the stitches might have just needed to stretch out a little bit because this morning, every single play that I moved or something pushed against it, it was kind of shooting up my elbow and into my shoulder,'' Dubnyk said. ''It's kind of a shock, like it catches you off.''\n\nDubnyk has been Minnesota's stalwart in net, but Kuemper filled in when Dubnyk was hurt earlier in the month and posted a 4-0-3 record in the month with a 1.26 goals-against average and .947 save percentage.\n\nDubnyk is 4-3-0 with a 1.88 goals-against average and .938 save percentage in December.\n\nView gallery Minnesota Wild center Charlie Coyle (3) and right wing Nino Niederreiter (22), of Switzerland, celeb \u2026\n\n''I think the way you show that you have character, you step in even if you're not probably 100 percent,'' Koivu said.\n\nDetroit coach Jeff Blashill lamented not making the game tougher for Dubnyk.\n\n''Not to take anything away from him, I thought he played good, but we didn't make it hard on him at all,'' Blashill said. ''But it's hard to make it hard when you turn pucks over, so you just have no speed at all, nothing generated. We were standing still because we kept turning it over. When we did get opportunities in the zone, we overpassed.''\n\nRed Wings goaltender Petr Mrazek finished with 32 saves.\n\nNOTES: Detroit F Dylan Larkin made his return after missing one game with a lower-body injury.

The Maple Leafs have at least one point in seven of their last eight games and have won three of four.\n\nAfter averaging 2.1 goals in their first 26 games, the Maple Leafs have scored 3.9 in their last eight.\n\n\"We have different systems now and we're doing a better job of playing with (the) system,\" said center Tyler Bozak. \"Guys are buying in.\"\n\nThe latest example was Sunday's 3-1 victory at New York, just Toronto's second against the Islanders in the last six meetings. Bozak extended his point streak to three games with a second-period goal, and former Islander Michael Grabner added the 100th of his career 1:40 later.\n\nJames van Riemsdyk scored into an empty net, giving him goals in three straight games and five points in that span. After scoring seven goals in his first 27 games and going without one for eight in a row, van Riemsdyk has six in his last seven games.\n\nThe best sign on Sunday for the Maple Leafs, however, was goaltender Jonathan Bernier's 25-save performance. The eight-year veteran opened the season 0-8-1 with a 3.28 goals-against average and was sent to the AHL for a conditioning stint on Dec. 2. He's been inconsistent with a 2.74 GAA in six appearances since his return, though he has won three of his last four starts and will be in net again on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's about his confidence, it's not about my confidence,\" coach Mike Babcock said. \"If he's confident, I'm confident. If he's not confident, I'm not confident. If he's not confident, his teammates aren't confident.\"\n\nNew York's confidence is wavering in similar fashion. The Islanders have followed an 8-0-2 streak with losses in four of five.\n\nNew York (19-12-5) earned a 5-2 win over Anaheim on Dec. 21 but scored three goals in the surrounding four defeats. The Islanders, winners of five of six in Toronto, were outshot 38-26 on their home ice Sunday.\n\n\"We passed up some opportunities. Their defense did a good job blocking shots,\" coach Jack Capuano said. \"We want to shoot pucks. For whatever reason (on Sunday) we passed up chances when we should have been shooting pucks.\"\n\nNew York did, however, kill off both of Toronto's power plays to move the league's second-best penalty kill percentage to 87.3. The Islanders have killed off all 31 of their opponents' power plays in the last 14 games. Toronto's power play has converted on 4 of 7 attempts in its last three.\n\nWith Jaroslav Halak placed on injured reserve with an upper-body injury on Sunday, New York will start Thomas Greiss again in net. Greiss, who made 35 saves in Sunday's loss, has a 1.24 GAA in his past four starts.\n\nIslanders captain John Tavares has one goal in his last 10 games overall, but has 17 points in 11 career games at Toronto.", "Anderson Silva Returns to Face Michael Bisping in UFC Fight Night 83 Main Event": "In a surprising move, UFC president Dana White on Thursday announced that Anderson Silva vs. Michael Bisping would headline UFC Fight Night 83 on Feb. 27 in London.\n\nThe match-up itself is not all that surprising, but the fact that the UFC is putting such a high profile main event on a UFC Fight Pass event is.

Our union is working closely with UNI Global Union to develop strong and fair standards for drug testing.\"\n\nThe Al-Jazeera report claimed that Manning took human growth hormone following neck surgery in 2011, and on Sunday the football player acknowledged he visited a clinic that allegedly supplied the banned substance.\n\nHowever, Manning, who missed the entire 2011 National Football League season with a serious neck injury, strenuously denied the claim made by the news network's report that he had used human growth hormone.\n\n\"As it relates to the particular allegations by Al-Jazeera, WADA expects that they will be carefully investigated by the relevant authorities and that, if warranted, necessary and appropriate steps would be taken,\" said Howman.\n\nThe NFL collective bargaining agreement, ratified in 2011, banned human growth hormone but players were not tested for the banned substance until 2014. No NFL player has tested positive for HGH.\n\nMajor League Baseball said it would investigate allegations made in the documentary that several of its players took banned hormone supplement Delta-2.\n\nAmong those baseball players named in the Al-Jazeera report by Charlie Sly as having received supplies of Delta-2 were Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies and Ryan Zimmerman of the Washington Nationals.\n\nA lawyer for Howard and Zimmerman denied the claims.\n\nIn a follow-up email to Al-Jazeera, Sly said that when he was speaking on camera, he was \"in no state of mind to be making any coherent statements as I was grieving the death of my fiance.\" (Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Mary Milliken)", "Bears believe they're headed in the right direction": "LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- No matter what happens after the final game of the regular season, Chicago Bears guard Matt Slauson is sure of one thing.\n\nThere is a different culture and attitude in the locker room. That just might be the biggest victory this season.\n\n''(Coach John) Fox, he's really tried to make this a player-run team,'' Slauson said. ''He wants us to take pride in our team, take ownership in our team, and we all believe in that as players. I think it's a great plan.\n\n''Also, the way we work, things aren't always going to go our way, and there's going to be tough times, but the great thing about this team is they just keep on working on preparing and getting better every week.''\n\nThe Bears (6-9) have improved in their first season under Fox and general manager Ryan Pace.\n\nThey beat Lovie Smith and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 26-21 Sunday to snap a three-game losing streak and exceed last season's win total under former coach Marc Trestman.\n\nChicago will avoid a last-place finish in the NFC North if it beats Detroit on Sunday.\n\nIf those seem as if they're modest accomplishments, well, they are. There are clearly some big issues to address. But the Bears believe they are positioned for bigger things.\n\nView gallery Chicago Bears running back Matt Forte (22) is sent flying on a tackle by Tampa Bay Buccaneers outsid \u2026\n\n''We fly United and I was talking to one of the flight attendants there. Five years ago they merged with Continental and they're still trying to figure that out,'' linebacker Sam Acho said.\n\n''So culture changes take time. But that's why I'm glad we have Coach Fox and we have the other coaches on the staff and the GM and the people here who are really turning around this organization.''\n\nAcho is one of a long line of players who have expiring contracts, a list that includes running back Matt Forte and No. 1 receiver Alshon Jeffery. Forte might be in his final days with the Bears given that he is at an age - 30 - where ball carriers tend to decline.\n\nJeffery might be a candidate for the franchise tag if the Bears don't want to give him a multiyear deal. After all, injuries have limited him to just nine games this season.\n\nOffensive coordinator Adam Gase and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio could be in the mix for head coaching jobs. There are holes on offense, defense and special teams. But despite all that, the Bears rarely got blown out.\n\n''We don't have a big margin for error, but the guys have competed, they've played as a football team,'' Fox said. ''I think when we've had that little stinger, that little edge, you know those have been games we've won.''\n\nThe Bears seemed to regain that edge against Tampa Bay, stopping a skid that wiped out their playoff hopes after they made a surprising jump into contention.\n\nThey ran for 174 yards on 39 rushes and dominated the time of possession 37:03 to 22:57, keeping Jameis Winston off the field for lengthy periods. They recovered two fumbles by the Buccaneers and got an interception by Harold Jones-Quartey after failing to force a turnover in two of the previous three games.\n\nMost of all, the Bears gave themselves a chance to finish the season on a strong note.\n\n''A lot of us want to stay together,'' said Acho, in his first season with the Bears. ''I think we all see that we're building toward something. Yeah, our record is 6-9 at this point. But we see the hope and we see that we're building toward something. We see the changes, especially guys that were on the team the past couple years.''\n\nNotes: Fox said he doesn't think NT Eddie Goldman will need surgery after leaving Sunday's game with a right ankle injury. ''But I don't know all the exact (details),'' he added. Goldman left in the third quarter.

These fantasy assets are all available in a majority of Yahoo leagues. Add as needed.\n\nSam Bradford, QB, Philadelphia Eagles, 35 percent owned\n\nBradford ownership has not been a pleasant experience at all times \u2014 or at any time in his career, you might argue. But over his last six games, he's been tolerable-to-good, tossing eight touchdown passes and only three interceptions while averaging 273.2 yard per game. He's topped 300 passing yards in back-to-back weeks (361, then 380), finally feeding the receivers we'd expected him to feed all season (Matthews and Ertz). Philly will close its season against the Giants in New York, facing a pass defense that ranks dead-last in terms of yards allowed. Expect another 300-plus from Bradford, with a top-12 positional finish.\n\nFAAB bid: It's Week 17, you guys. Empty the wallet. There is no Week 18. Spend what you've got.\n\nDeVante Parker, WR, Miami Dolphins, 33 percent owned\n\n\n\nSunday's game film might not be totally kind to Parker (although the Dolphins' standards don't seem particularly high), but the stats were certainly there in Week 16. Parker snagged four balls for 93 yards on 10 targets against the Colts, which gives him 180 receiving yards over his last two games. He has the necessary size (6-foot-3) and skill-set to function as a useful red-zone weapon, although he obviously isn't tied to the league's most dynamic offense. Miami will host New England to close out a dreadful season, and Parker has a clear opportunity to make some noise against a banged-up Pats secondary. He belongs in the WR3 discussion in a tricky week.\n\nView photo . Mike Gillislee racked up another touchdown in Week 16. (Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images) Buffalo Bills, 10 percent owned\n\n\n\nAnother week, another long highlight touchdown for Gillislee. That's three scores in three weeks, if you hadn't noticed. Gillislee was out-touched by Karlos Williams on Sunday (19 to 11), but both backs topped 90 scrimmage yards and both found the end-zone. Williams is the safer fantasy play, but he's long gone in competitive leagues. Buffalo's running game draws a tough matchup in Week 17, facing the Jets D, but it's tough to argue with Gillislee's recent production. LeSean McCoy (MCL) is almost certainly done for the year, which keeps Gillislee in the flex conversation.\n\nZach Miller, TE, Chicago Bears, 37 percent owned\n\n\n\nMiller led the Bears in targets (8), catches (7) and receiving yards (69) in Sunday's win at Tampa Bay, and he's averaging six receptions per week over his last three. What's not to like? With Martellus Bennett done for the year and Alshon Jeffery dinged, Miller has emerged as a preferred option for Jay Cutler. Chicago finishes up with a home matchup against Detroit's middle-of-the-pack pass D, so there's no reason not to trust Miller in the season-ender.\n\nJermaine Kearse, WR, Seattle Seahawks, 15 percent owned\n\n\n\nKearse delivered a late garbage-ish touchdown in Week 16, giving him 17 catches for 222 yards and one spike on 21 targets over his last three games. Seattle faces a degree-of-difficulty matchup at Arizona next Sunday, but the Cards have allowed decent fantasy lines to guys like Jordan Matthews, Mike Wallace and Anquan Boldin in recent weeks. We're not talking about a D that needs to be completely avoided. In deeper formats, Kearse is reasonable play.\n\nPierre Thomas, RB, Washington, 1 percent owned\n\n\n\nP.T. caught seven balls on eight targets in the division-clincher for Washington, finishing with 89 scrimmage yards and functioning as the team's primary passing-down RB. Can't say we saw that comin'. If you're a PPR owner with a desperate need for help, Thomas gets a road game against Dallas in Week 17.\n\nIndianapolis Colts, 17 percent owned\n\n\n\nNo, the Colts D is not an ideal play under any circumstances, but the team is at home in Week 17, facing a talent-starved Tennessee offense. The Mettenbergers have averaged only 10.0 points per game over their last three, all losses. Indy has piled up 12 sacks and five takeaways in its last three.

Another star in that gorgeous flag.\n\nA year and a half in, though, it appears that Gasol is not as big a fan of something that far, far too many people think is a Chicago staple. \u201cChicago-style\u201d pizza, ugh.\n\nFrom a fantastic talk with the great Alex Wong at GQ:\n\nWhat about Chicago-style deep dish pizza?\n\nI\u2019ve tried it. I\u2019m not a fan of this deep dish pizza. To me, it\u2019s just a cake of melted cheese. I like the thin-crusted pizzas better.\n\nOK, we\u2019re back to offer a few notes after walking around the block for a bit, yelling at squirrels, cursing the gods, channeling Studs and Dahl and Bun E. and the whole lot of them.\n\nFirst off? Deep dish pizza is delicious. If someone offered you \u201ca cake of melted cheese\u201d that could also be filled with varying types of sausage and, perhaps, a bit of spinach, would you turn it down? Bring to me all of the cheese-cakes in question. Not the sweet ones. The other ones, with a giant patty of sausage that lines the entire thing. The one I can cover in dried red pepper flake.\n\nNow that this is established, we need to re-iterate something that Kyle Kinane so perfectly put in a set of his a few years back (one we cannot embed due to its NSFW-but-seriously-if-you-haven\u2019t-heard-this-bit-click-on-this-link nature).\n\nNobody in Chicago eats \u201cChicago-style pizza.\u201d I grew up in the city and then the suburbs, and the second time I remember eating it was when my family had to make a dinner stop on a road trip at a \u201cChicago-style\u201d restaurant chain in Indianapolis. \u201cChicago-style pizza,\u201d as Kinane mentioned, is something you do after your uncle and cousin visit you from St. Louis and they treat you to your first trip to Navy Pier for a Ferris Wheel ride when you\u2019re 23. This is literally a thing that happened to me.\n\nSomebody, before Pau opts out of his contract this summer, needs to drag the big man out to a real Chicago-style pizza place. Where the crust is thin, the sausage is Italian, and the fennel is flowing. Where they give you an RC Cola one-liter bottle with every delivery purchase. Where the menu, for some reason, still offers fried calamari and baked ziti. Where you a be sure that, in a kitchen that still somehow makes something called a \u201cpizza puff,\u201d the only authentic thing in the whole damn place is a thin-crust, square-sliced, CHICAGO-STYLE PIZZA.\n\nDibs on the corner piece.\n\nAs someone whose parents refused to order chain pizza until I had too many Book It! coupons to ignore, I feel as if I\u2019m qualified to act as the expert, here. The heartburn-riddled, \u201cyeah, let\u2019s do mushrooms and black olives on it this time, too\u201d-expert. I have an uncle that had to move out of Chicago and into southern Illinois, and he once got into a angry war of words over the lack of good square-cut pizza options down there with a Malkovich. The actual father that created John Malkovich. This is how seriously we take these sorts of things.\n\nI will defend the bucket of cheese that will, sadly, forever remain my city\u2019s represent entry into every pizza competition. It is delicious and, hilariously, it will still anger and endless series of dumb dads when they hit up a \u201cChicago-style\u201d pizza chain restaurant with the wife and the whole gang, expecting the pie to come out in 30 minutes of less so as to avoid The Noid. Those dads deserve to wait for an extra 30 minutes, although the server certainly doesn\u2019t deserve that 15 percent tip they\u2019ll get.\n\nChicago-style pizza comes flat, it comes crisp, you don\u2019t fold it and you have to unwrap it from a sweltering, steaming, paper cover.\n\nSomeone let Pau know.

''They are pounding people. Sometimes, when they don't play as well, they beat you up. They have a good defense. Defense always leads you. They've got a quarterback making all kinds of plays. I think they are going to be hard to beat.''\n\nThe Panthers are 11-0 and close out the season at New Orleans, with two games against Atlanta, at the New York Giants and home against Tampa Bay. Only the 1972 Miami Dolphins completed a perfect season, going 14-0 in the regular season and winning the Super Bowl.\n\nGibbs, now a NASCAR team owner, said the Panthers' task will be keeping their intensity level high over the final five weeks of the regular season.\n\n''The hardest thing in the world is to have a long string of wins ... you just can't get up that many times,'' Gibbs said. ''In sports, where everybody is pretty close, if you're down and somebody is up - the other thing that happens to you when you win a bunch of games, the other coach, for instance in football, the easiest thing in the world is to say, 'Hey, we're playing the Panthers right now, they're undefeated.'\n\n''All of you have to say is that and your guys are ready whereas the Panthers are trying to come up with some reason to play somebody that is 6-3 or something. So it's hard. The hardest thing in pro sports is to consistently stay up.''\n\nGibbs also had advice for Panthers coach Ron Rivera as he prepares for the final stretch of the season. There will likely be a push for Rivera to rest key players before the playoffs, but Gibbs said that can be tricky.\n\n''I would always say, 'Hey, we're starting everybody. We're going.' And I'd keep it that way all week, I'd practice that way all week and then when the game started, as soon as we got into it a little ways, I'd go, 'Get them out,' '' Gibbs said. ''But don't tell them in advance. You tell them in advance, it's going to be a mess.''", "Sharks-Flames Preview": "The Calgary Flames might be last in the Western Conference, but they continue to play well at home.\n\nThey can extend their winning streak at the Saddledome to seven games by handing the San Jose Sharks a season-high fourth consecutive defeat Tuesday night.\n\nAfter opening with four straight losses at home and scoring 15 times over the first seven there, Calgary (10-14-2) has recorded 18 non-shootout goals in the last five on its own ice. In the second of a five-game home stretch Friday, the Flames beat Boston 5-4 in overtime to win six straight there for the first time since an eight-game run during the lockout shortened 2012-13 season.\n\nCalgary, which has won three of the last four against the Sharks at home, has a chance Tuesday to win three straight overall for the first time this season.\n\n\"Keep going,\" coach Bob Hartley said. \"We want to take advantage of this homestand.

Owner of a league-low 12.2-percent conversion rate, Calgary is 1 for 28 with the man advantage in the last nine games.\n\n\"We're going to keep working,\" Hartley said.\n\nGaudreau was held without a point while the Flames went 0 for 3 with the man advantage to lose 5-2 at San Jose (14-12-0) on Nov. 28.

Yeldon and shifty receivers Marqise Lee and Rashad Greene, and the Jaguars have amassed one of the best collections of young offensive talent in the league.\n\nThe defense is another story.\n\nAnd Caldwell and Bradley expect the offseason to be centered on rebuilding that side of the ball.\n\nThe Jaguars rank 25th in the league in total defense, with the most glaring weaknesses being an inconsistent pass rush and a struggle to get off the field on third down.\n\nCaldwell spent his first three drafts rebuilding the offense, and the results show.\n\nNow, it's time to address the defense. And many believe Caldwell will use most, if not all, of his draft picks on that side of the ball. Throw in a few free agents and the return of injured first-round draft pick Dante Fowler Jr. and talented defensive tackle Sen'Derrick Marks, and the Jags could look considerably different on the defensive side of the ball in 2016.\n\nIf the defense makes the kind of leap the offense did this season, the Jaguars should be in playoff contention next year.

In this one, however, they turned back the Steelers (9-6), who were riding a three-game winning streak and striving for a playoff berth.\n\n''This might sound brash, but we believed the whole time that we were going to beat Pittsburgh,'' Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith said. ''Records, score, how good they're playing - nothing matters when you're playing Pittsburgh.''\n\nSmith had an interception and limited the dangerous Antonio Brown to 61 yards, part of a strong defensive effort that gave Baltimore with its first season sweep of its AFC North rivals since 2011.\n\n''It makes this season because obviously we can't go to the playoffs,'' Smith said.\n\nMaking his seventh career start - the first with Baltimore - Ryan Mallett went 28 for 41 for a career-high 274 yards and a touchdown. Signed by the Ravens on Dec. 15, he was the fourth quarterback to start for Baltimore in a span of six weeks.\n\n''Getting the start was awesome,'' he said. ''Getting a win was even better.''\n\nThe stunning, agonizing loss ended Pittsburgh's 10-game winning streak in December. The Steelers are still in contention for a wild-card berth, but they will need to beat Cleveland next week and get some help.\n\n''We didn't handle the business in the stadium today, so we're left to look around at other stadiums,'' coach Mike Tomlin said. ''Such is life this time of year when you don't do what you're supposed to do. And we didn't today. We take ownership over that.''\n\nDeAngelo Williams ran for 100 yards and had six catches for 53 yards. Ben Roethlisberger went 23 for 33 for 227 yards with two interceptions.\n\n''We controlled our own destiny and we gave the ball away,'' Roethlisberger said.\n\nBaltimore, which came in with a minus-15 turnover differential, had two takeaways and did not commit a turnover.\n\nUp 20-10 with just over seven minutes left, the Ravens appeared to clinch the upset when Smith ran 101 yards with an interception for a touchdown. But Baltimore's Courtney Upshaw lined up offside on the play, negating the TD, and Williams scored his second touchdown with 6:33 left.\n\nThe Ravens held on. On fourth-and-15 at the Pittsburgh 37, a pass from Roethlisberger to Markus Wheaton fell incomplete following the two-minute warning.\n\nThe Steelers didn't get the ball again until there was 4 seconds left.\n\n''We were thinking we were going to beat them, and we knew it,'' Ravens defensive back Lardarius Webb said.\n\nDown 13-3 at halftime, the Steelers got back into it with the aid of two pass interference calls totaling 53 yards. The penalties, against Smith and Kendrick Lewis, led to a 1-yard run by Williams that cut the deficit to three points.\n\nLater in the quarter, the Ravens put together a 13-play drive that concluded with a punt. Though the march did not produce points, Baltimore kept the ball away from the Steelers for nearly seven minutes and pinned Pittsburgh on its own 9.\n\nRoethlisberger threw his second interception a few minutes later. Mallett then connected with Chris Givens for 39 yards and Kyle Juszczyk for 34 to set up a 3-yard touchdown run by Javorius Allen, making it 20-10.\n\nRoethlisberger went 7 for 12 for 66 yards and an interception in the first half, a 38.9 quarterback rating.\n\nAfter the Ravens stuffed Williams on a fourth-down run following the opening kickoff, Mallett's first drive with Baltimore could not have gone better. He moved the Ravens 75 yards in 15 plays, went 4 for 4 on third down and threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Chris Matthews to complete a possession that lasted more than seven minutes.\n\nThe Steelers then settled for a field goal after an apparent 16-yard touchdown catch by Brown was overturned by a replay.\n\nMallett produced in his second series, too, covering 61 yards in 11 plays before Justin Tucker kicked a field goal for a 10-3 lead. It marked the first time this season Baltimore got as many as 10 points on its first two possessions.\n\nAn interception by Ravens linebacker Daryl Smith led to a 50-yard field goal late in the half.\n\nNOTES: Pittsburgh CB Antwon Blake (back spasm) left in the second quarter and FB Roosevelt Nix (right foot) left in the fourth quarter.

But in the full documentary, which tries to shed a light on athletes obtaining and using PEDs, some things are clear.\n\nThe documentary throws in Manning as almost an afterthought because he is the biggest name that Sly talked about. It takes 40 minutes into the 50-minute documentary before the show starts focusing on the Denver Broncos' quarterback. There's no specific allegation against Manning. This is a point almost everyone has missed. The only thing that is said is growth hormone was sent to his wife, and then the report creatively suggests Peyton Manning has something to do with it. Manning isn't specifically accused of anything by Al Jazeera, the documentary just lets people come to that conclusion on their own.\n\nOn NBC's \"Today\" show on Tuesday, Al Jazeera reporter Deborah Davies, who was the narrator of the documentary, says that the show makes no allegations toward Manning.\n\n\"Do you have specific evidence that Peyton Manning himself has ever taken HGH?\" -@CarsonDaly asked AJ reporter https://t.co/BB4e040S2B \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) December 29, 2015\n\n\"The only allegation in the program, from Charlie Sly, is that growth hormone was sent repeatedly from the Guyer [Institute] to Ashley Manning in Florida,\" Davies said.\n\nWhen asked if Al Jazeera had any evidence against Peyton Manning, Davies said there is none.\n\n\"We're not making the allegation against Peyton Manning,\" Davies said, sounding surprised that anyone would possibly think that a documentary which has a man on hidden camera saying growth hormone was sent to Ashley Manning would in any way lead to a conclusion about Peyton Manning.\n\nThis is where I have a big problem with the Manning part of the documentary.\n\nAl Jazeera is a reputable media company, but it's irresponsible to throw out a single source (who may or may not be a reputable one) saying Ashley Manning got growth hormone and then claim there were no allegations against Peyton Manning. That's disingenuous and reckless.\n\nThe documentary, with brooding music, talks about how \"Manning's career almost ended\" in 2011 because of a neck injury. Then it says Sly was \"part of a medical team\" that helped Manning. Manning went to the Guyer Institute in Indianapolis, under the watch of the Colts. Sly says on the hidden camera that Ashley Manning was sent drugs. Then Davies' voice comes on again, to say \"growth hormone is banned in the NFL.\" Last I checked, Ashley Manning doesn't play in the NFL. The documentary clearly suggests Peyton Manning did something wrong. There's even an angry response from Manning's agent about the insinuations put forth by Al Jazeera.\n\nSo, again, to say a couple days after the documentary is released and Manning has been in the middle of a controversy that \"We're not making the allegation against Peyton Manning\" ... that doesn't cut it. Perhaps it's just to cover themselves legally, as Manning threatens a lawsuit, but it's wrong.\n\nAl Jazeera's reporter from the documentary said Tuesday that there are not any allegations made against Peyton Manning. For some reason then, the reporters thought it was relevant to discuss Ashley Manning's medical history? An already shaky story, at least when it comes to the parts about Peyton Manning, looks even worse.\n\nIn the Manning part of the report, Al Jazeera is tossing out an incomplete part of a story and letting the viewer make the assumptions linking Peyton Manning to HGH.

The new A350 XWB line of jets features several design elements aimed to ease jet lag and improve the customer\u2019s onboard overall experience.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: This fan theory explains who the new Star Wars villain might really be\n\nAccording to Quartz, Airbus spent $15 billion developing the new A350 XWB, with the first models being already used by Qatar Airways.\n\nAirbus figured out various features to trick our bodies to adapt faster to a new time zone, such as light adjustment. The company equipped the A350 XWB with special LED lighting that changes color temperature during the flight to mimic the light from the sun. That way, the body should better adapt to the changes in light, and, thus produce melatonin earlier than it\u2019s supposed to, thus preparing passengers for a good night\u2019s sleep at the appropriate time after they land.\n\nThe system is apparently capable of producing 16.7 million different light color combinations that can be adapted to any flight length or change of time zones.\n\nThe new A350 XWB also has better air than other planes. Research has shown that changes in pressure and low humidity exacerbate jet lag. The new plane has a frame made in part (53%) from strong but lightweight carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic, a higher proportion than on any other previous model. In addition to making the A350 XWB more fuel efficient, the design helps out with humidity.\n\nBecause it\u2019s not made of aluminum, the plane is less prone to corrosion, which means humidity isn\u2019t a problem. The airplane can be pressurized to 6,000 feet, closer to the pressure on the ground, and an altitude that allows for more humidity in the air.\n\nThe new filtration system in the plane turns over the air every two to three minutes, which should improve overall air and sleep quality.\n\nFinally, the plane offers bigger seats even in economy \u2013 one inch wider than other aircraft \u2013 and has a wing design inspired by bird wings that is supposed to reduce noise.\n\nIt\u2019s yet to be determined whether Airbus\u2019 new measures to fight jet lag will actually work, but the new A350 XWB design choices and features to mitigate jet lag are certainly interesting.\n\nRelated stories\n\n7 scary airplane landings caught on video\n\nThe one thing you should be doing before flying out for the holidays\n\nThese might be the best seats you'll ever get to buy on a plane\n\nMore from BGR: This site lets you see your best nine Instagram pics of 2015 \u2013 and anyone else\u2019s best nine\n\nThis article was originally published on BGR.com", "Coughlin says put the blame on me, leave the players alone": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Tom Coughlin is going to approach what might be his final week as New York Giants coach just as he has went into every other game week since taking over the team in 2004 and leading it to two Super Bowls.\n\nThis week is about winning, knocking off the Philadelphia Eagles in the regular-season finale and ending on a high note.\n\nCoughlin insists this week is not about either him or his future as coach. He is upset his players have been put in a position where they are being asked about letting down their 69-year-old leader.\n\n''I feel badly that they feel that way,'' Coughlin said Monday. ''It's a shame that they have to be put in a position where they have to respond about something to do with me. It's not about me. I'm here for them.\n\n''If you want to break it all down, blame it all on me. I'm the head coach, I'm responsible, I lose the games for our players. Put it that way, leave it that way. We try like heck not to put these young men in a position where they feel badly about the circumstances that the head coach finds himself in,'' Coughlin said in a rather short day-after news conference with the media.\n\nCoughlin's future with the Giants (6-9) was further put in doubt Sunday night when they were crushed 49-17 by the Vikings in Minnesota for their fifth loss in six games. New York has now missed the playoffs four straight seasons, with three straight losing records.\n\nView gallery New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning (10) tries to get away from Minnesota Vikings defensive end \u2026\n\nWhile many speculated the Giants quit Sunday night, Coughlin felt his players played with effort.\n\nCoughlin said his focus is going to be on beating the Eagles, who easily defeated the Giants earlier this season in one of the few games that they were never in contention.\n\n''I have tried very hard, and you know this for a fact, the situation is not about me,'' Coughlin said. ''I am hoping the players are not going to be centered around that. We are going to conduct ourselves as we always have. We are going to work as hard as we possibly can and put our players in the best position we can, and we'll let whatever happens, happen.''\n\nWhile the Giants didn't have the best talent in the league, they easily could have won the weak NFC East. Six of their losses came in the final 75 seconds of games. Four losses were in the final :07 of regulation, including three on the final play. One loss was in overtime when Josh Brown missed his first field goal of the season after the Jets tied the game late in regulation.\n\nIt leaves co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch with decisions, not only with Coughlin, but also general manager Jerry Reese.\n\nView gallery Minnesota Vikings free safety Harrison Smith, left, runs with his interception for a touchdown as he \u2026\n\nBoth men combined to lead the Giants to Super Bowl wins over the Patriots in February 2008 and '12.\n\n''I thought we would have an opportunity this year, and the way the season was ending up at the halfway point, we had a great opportunity, and even the last couple of weeks, haven't done enough to make the playoffs,'' Eli Manning said Monday. ''We just couldn't win some close games and we had a lot of them. We had great opportunities to win games and be right in the mix and we didn't take advantage of it.''\n\nManning said Coughlin has not spoken to the team about his future as coach. He said Coughlin has gotten the team ready every week, doing an outstanding job of picking them up after each tough loss.\n\n''Obviously, I have great respect for him,'' the two-time Super Bowl MVP said. ''I wanted to do my job and do my job well, and get into the playoffs and have a big season so he could continue to be the head coach. I have such respect for him and he's the only coach I've had in the NFL, and in that sense, (I) feel disappointed that I wasn't able to play at a better level for him.''\n\n-\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL", "A year in golf: Tales from the tour": "No one knows for sure when Tiger Woods will compete again, and that includes Woods. Still, there were indications earlier this month he wasn't ready to retire.\n\nWoods watched from a golf cart at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. He also spent time in the TV booth, as he often does during his tournament. Woods might not always have a lot to offer in an interview, but he's a natural talking about golf. He is so good in the booth that someone jokingly suggested perhaps he should replace Johnny Miller when he's done playing.\n\nWoods laughed.\n\n''Talking about golf comes easy to me. I can do that all day,'' he said. ''But I don't want to sit around and watch golf up there. I want to be out here.''\n\nThe waiting game will continue into 2016, and who knows how much longer?\n\nIn the meantime, there were plenty of activity and anecdotes that went beyond Jordan Spieth's two majors, the rise of the next generation and Woods' future.\n\n---\n\nSo much has been made of the high school class of 2011, and it came into focus during a practice round at the Valspar Championship at Innisbrook. Spieth joined Justin Thomas, Daniel Berger and Ollie Schniederjans for a (small) money game on the back nine.\n\nGolf Channel wanted a shot of them all standing next to each other on the 11th hole, and one of them got the idea they should line up in order of their age. They were all 21 at the time. Spieth was in his third year on tour. Thomas and Berger were PGA Tour rookies. Schniederjans was still at Georgia Tech, playing that week on an exemption.\n\nThey started calling out their birthdays to get in the right order. The youngest of the bunch?\n\nSpieth.\n\nThis was one week after he cleared $9 million in career earnings.\n\n---\n\nUnlike the PGA Tour's clandestine policy of discipline, the European Tour will confirm when a player has been fined, even though it might not disclose the amount.\n\nThat much was evident when word surfaced at Doral that Rory McIlroy had hurled a 3-iron into the lake to the left of the eighth fairway in the Cadillac Championship. McIlroy is a member of both tours.\n\nA few British journalists inquired about a fine, leading to a radio exchange between two European Tour officials working the event.\n\n''Is throwing a club a fine?'' came the query.\n\nEuropean Tour chief referee Andy McFee, sitting in a cart near the 11th hole, replied that it depended on the circumstances. A player who tossed his club in the direction of his golf bag, for example, might not be disciplined.\n\nLong pause.\n\n''In that case,'' the other official said, ''it appears his bag would have to be at the bottom of the lake.''\n\n---\n\nNot long after Augusta National Golf Club opened, co-founder Clifford Roberts wanted members to wear their green jackets during the tournament so that they would be easily recognized as reliable sources of information for the patrons.\n\nIt's a tradition that still lives today.\n\nDuring the tournament, Augusta National member Geoff Yang (also working as a rules official) was in a cart to the right of the ninth fairway in his green jacket. About that time, a man approached and politely said to Yang, ''Can I ask you a question?''\n\nCertainly, Yang replied.\n\n''Do you have the time?''\n\nOK, maybe this wasn't what Roberts had in mind.\n\n---\n\nSpieth and Justin Leonard were on the putting green at the Memorial when Leonard mentioned he didn't play the Byron Nelson Championship this year for the first time. This was a big deal. Leonard, among the prominent players to come out of Dallas, has never fared well at his hometown event.\n\nSpieth was surprised and asked Leonard if he caught any grief.\n\n''No. Because you played,'' Leonard told the Masters champion. ''So thank you. I owe you dinner.''\n\nSpieth smiled, slowly nodded and went back to work on his putting. Moments later, two representatives from a PGA Tour event approached Spieth to introduce themselves. Spieth stopped what he was doing to shake their hands, and the two men felt comfortable enough to keep talking. A few seconds turned into a few minutes.\n\nLeonard, in his 22nd year on tour, saw what was going on and walked over Spieth.\n\n''Hey, Jordan, I need to tell you something,'' he said, placing his hand on Spieth's shoulder.\n\nThe two representatives recognized the private moment, thanked Spieth for his time, said goodbye and walked away.\n\nLeonard looked right at Spieth and said in a low voice, ''You're welcome. And now we're even.''\n\n---\n\nWayne Gretzky was standing on a hill looking over the 18th green at Chambers Bay as he watched his future son-in-law, Dustin Johnson, go from a chance to win the U.S. Open to the most crushing loss of his career in a matter of three putts.\n\nJohnson headed to Idaho with the Gretzky clan for a getaway. The next morning, Gretzky said he took a group out to play golf. On the second green, they looked behind to see a cart fast approaching. It was Johnson, who wanted to know why no one asked him to join the game.\n\nGretzky told this story in August, and it amazed him how much Johnson was able to move on from setbacks.\n\n''I know this much,'' Gretzky said. ''If I ever lost Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, I wouldn't want to skate with a bunch of amateurs the next day.''\n\n---\n\nAnirban Lahiri showed class and grace at the Presidents Cup, where he patiently took every question on a 3-foot putt he missed that cost his team a chance to win.\n\nHe is capable of frustration, too, and he showed that at the Hero World Challenge when he said, ''If my mom had putted, she would have shot 65.'' The next day, he felt terrible about what he said (after making it clear that his mother doesn't play golf) without making excuses.\n\n''That's probably the most embarrassing thing I've said in the media in my life,'' he said. ''I pride myself in how I carry myself and what I say, and that's nothing like I would like to come across as. Having said that, what's said is said.''\n\nHow he presents himself was clear at ''India Night,'' a party Hero Motor Corp. hosted at Albany. Lahiri dressed for the occasion - a red kurta and jobhburis, which are sandals he said can be found only in the northwest region of India.\n\n''I have to thank my wife for that. She made sure I put it in my suitcase,'' he said. ''Hero is very much part of the family, and it was important for me to represent.''\n\nHe gets to represent the PGA Tour next year, and it should be happy to have him.", "Bisping on Silva bout: \u2018This fight represents me beating everyone who wanted to cheat the system\u2019": "View gallery .

Aroldis Chapman (AP Photo) New York Yankees traded for closer Aroldis Chapman on Monday, shunting aside concerns about an ugly domestic violence incident that could lead to a long suspension and banking on the success of a bullpen that already includes ace relievers Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances, a source familiar with the deal told Yahoo Sports.\n\nChapman, 27, is the hardest-throwing pitcher in baseball history, regularly topping 100 mph with his left-handed fastball, setting strikeout-rate records and racking up 145 saves over the last four seasons for the Cincinnati Reds. After a deal sending Chapman to the Los Angeles Dodgers fell apart during the Winter Meetings amid the Yahoo Sports report of the incident in Chapman\u2019s Florida home, the Reds regrouped, assessed the market and acquired four minor league players from New York.\n\nRight-handed starter Rookie Davis and third baseman Eric Jagielo are the main return for Cincinnati, along with right-handed reliever Caleb Cotham \u2013 who pitched for a short time in the big leagues last season \u2013 and second baseman Tony Renda. Davis, 22, is a 6-foot-5, 250-pounder who last season struck out nearly a batter an inning and posted nearly a 5-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Jagielo, 23, is a former first-round pick out of Notre Dame whose inability to stay healthy has hampered him, as has questions surrounding his ability to stay at third base.\n\nIt\u2019s far from the sort of haul expected for Chapman, who could reach free agency after the 2016 season. His status depends on the length of his suspension, which could potentially cut into his service time enough to delay free agency a season.\n\nMajor League Baseball continues to investigate the case, in which Chapman was neither arrested nor charged with a crime. He admitted to police he fired eight gunshots in his garage after an argument with his girlfriend in which she alleged he choked her.\n\nMultiple executives, in the immediate aftermath of the report, deemed Chapman \u201ctoxic.\u201d The Yankees disagreed, and their acquisition of him Monday gives them a handful of options. They could slot him into the ninth inning and back him with Miller and Betances to form perhaps the best back-end bullpen ever. The trio combined for 347 strikeouts in 212 innings during the 2015 season. Or they could flip Miller, as they almost did to the Houston Astros during the Winter Meetings, for more organizational depth.", "Cuban pitcher Yaisel Sierra is now officially a free agent": "The elite starting pitchers may already be off the board, but there's still significant talent to be had on the free-agent market. Another name was added to that list Monday, as Cuban pitcher Yaisel Sierra is now officially a free-agent. Sierra is now free to sign with any team.\n\nThe 24-year-old split time as a starter and reliever in Cuba, but has impressed scouts with his stuff. During an exhibition in October, Sierra retired all nine hitters he faced according to Jesse Sanchez of MLB.com. There were roughly 350 scouts watching Sierra at that event.\n\nWhile there are questions about his role and eventual upside, it's assumed Sierra can help a major-league club in 2016. Our own Jeff Passan ranked Sierra as the 32nd best free-agent, just behind Yovani Gallardo and slightly ahead of J.A. Happ and Marco Estrada.\n\nSierra joins Japanese pitcher Kenta Maeda as the best international free-agent on the market. Maeda was ranked 21st on Passan's list, and is expected to draw more interest and a bigger contract than Sierra.\n\nDue to his age, Sierra isn't subject to international signing bonus pools. That means teams can spend as much as they want on Sierra, and they won't be penalized in future signing periods. Because of that, many expect the bidding for Sierra to be significant. According to Sanchez, the deal could be similar to the $27 million contract signed by Cincinnati Reds pitched Raisel Iglesias last offseason. It also could exceed the four-year, $32 million deal given to Jose Contreras in 2002.\n\nSierra isn't coming off his finest season. In 62 innings, the right-hander posted a 6.10 ERA in relief. Most of his struggles came in the second half of the season, according to Baseball America. Despite those issues, Sierra should still draw interest. He's reportedly hit 96 mph with his fastball, and has shown the ability to throw an above-average slider. He also works with multiple arm angles.\n\nThough Sierra wasn't approved as a free-agent until Monday, teams have known he would be available for a couple months now. All parties involved have had months to prepare, so it's possible Sierra could sign fairly soon. For teams that lost out on elite pitchers, Sierra could be a solid consolation prize. He comes with risks, but so does every other pitcher on the market right now.\n\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.

I just felt like the last three years, in the fourth quarter we always slip up and let them win. I'm glad we got the W,'' St. Louis cornerback Trumaine Johnson said.\n\nTodd Gurley scored on a 2-yard TD run with 10:34 left, Akeem Ayers returned a fumble 45 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter and the Rams ended Seattle's five-game win streak with a 23-17 victory.\n\nSt. Louis swept the season series from the Seahawks (9-6) having won 34-31 in overtime in Week 1. And the Rams (7-8) caused the same kinds of problems they did in the opener by flustering Wilson and slowing down a Seahawks offense that had not been stopped for the previous five weeks.\n\nGurley rushed for 85 yards on 19 carries. Case Keenum won his third straight start for the Rams, completing 14 of 23 passes for 103 yards and a 28-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Britt in the second quarter.\n\nIt was enough for the Rams to win in Seattle for the first time since the NFC wild-card playoffs in Jan. 8, 2005, when St. Louis came away with a 27-20 victory and most of the current roster was in high school or even younger.\n\n''It's nice to win three straight against good teams. We have a chance to go 5-1 in the division and finish on a winning note. That's what our focus is going to be,'' Rams coach Jeff Fisher said.\n\nSt. Louis has turned around a season that appeared headed for turmoil at 4-8. The Rams have won three straight and with a Week 17 win at San Francisco can finish with a .500 record for the first time since 2006. It's not enough to get St. Louis to the postseason, but the effort is still there.\n\nAnd there was no greater example than center Tim Barnes, who was given the game ball afterward. He helped not allow any sacks and was credited with a pair of critical fumble recoveries in the fourth quarter.\n\nBenny Cunningham fumbled on a third-and-1 at the Seattle 40 and it appeared Seattle's Earl Thomas had fallen on the loose ball. But officials ruled that Barnes had made the recovery and was down by contact before the ball ended up back in Seattle's possession under the pile.\n\nTwo plays later, Gurley darted 20 yards inside the Seattle 10, but as he hurdled Thomas was hit and fumbled. Again the scramble for the ball ended up in the arms of Barnes chasing the play downfield and three plays later Gurley was in the end zone and St. Louis had a 13-point lead.\n\n''Just got to follow the ball. That's what we try and do every play. That's what we do as an O-line, we try to chase the ball and keep our guys from getting hit downfield and if something does happen like that we want to try and be there.''\n\nAyers had given St. Louis an early 10-0 lead when he scooped Will Tukuafu's fumble and returned it for his first career touchdown, shaking off a tackle attempt by Wilson.\n\nIt was part of a banner day for the Rams defense that forced three turnovers including Wilson's first interception in 168 pass attempts by Johnson in the first half.\n\nWilson was sacked four times and hit 13 times according to the final stats. Wilson was 25 of 41 for 289 yards and two touchdowns, including an 18-yard TD to Jermaine Kearse with 17 seconds left. But St. Louis recovered the onside kick and ran out the clock.\n\nWilson also threw a 25-yard touchdown to Doug Baldwin in the third quarter that appeared to be the start of Seattle's second-half rally. It never materialized and the Rams were left celebrating.\n\n''Ultimately we had multiple chances of winning the game. We can't really make any excuses,'' Seattle defensive end Michael Bennett said.\n\nNOTES: St. Louis DE Ethan Westbrooks, DT Nick Fairly and S Mark Barron all left the game with concussions. Johnson was checked for a concussion and allowed to return. ... Baldwin's TD was his 14th of the season setting a new franchise record. ...

(AP) -- The Anaheim Ducks' special teams produced three goals against a rugged Philadelphia Flyers squad that always seems to bring out opponents' raw emotions.\n\nCorey Perry had the tying and go-ahead goals, Shawn Horcoff scored a short-handed goal and Ryan Getzlaf connected on a power play, leading the Ducks to a 4-2 victory.\n\n''That's definitely how we have to play,'' Perry said. ''When we don't, we're flat. So we have to play that upbeat style, and a lot of guys played really well.''\n\nDefenseman Sami Vatanen had two assists and John Gibson made 24 saves in his first career game against the Flyers, extending the Ducks' winning streak against them to five games - their longest streak ever against Philadelphia. They are 8-0-2 in the last 10 meetings.\n\n''Every time we play those guys, it's an emotional game,'' coach Bruce Boudreau said. ''Even though we only play them twice a year, that's what Philly brings out in us. We've got a bunch of big boys that love to get involved in the hitting. We had a lot of emotion right from the beginning, and I think that was what we needed.''\n\nThe Ducks and Flyers, who are among the five most penalized teams in the league in terms of minutes, had a wild scrum at 4:29 of the first period after Perry crashed the net and became entangled with goalie Steve Mason.\n\n''I don't think I hit him at all, really. I think it was more my stick going in and reaching for the puck,'' Perry said. ''But he came up swinging, and stuff happened from there. That's kind of what I do.''\n\nThe melee resulted in 10-minute misconducts for Kevin Bieksa and Flyers center Ryan White. Perry and Luke Schenn received roughing penalties, as did Mason - putting Anaheim on the power play for the first time.\n\nPhiladelphia's Claude Giroux was sent off for slashing 32 seconds after the scrum, giving the Ducks a two-man advantage for almost 1 1-2 minutes. They scored the game's first goal with one second left on Mason's penalty, as Getzlaf used teammate Ryan Kesler as a screen and beat Mason to the glove side with a one-timer from above the right circle.\n\nThe goal ended an 0-for-18 drought by the Ducks on the power play spanning the previous eight games., and marked the first time this season that their captain put a puck past a goaltender. Getzlaf's only other goal was an empty-netter on Nov. 16 at Carolina.\n\n''It felt good. That's the first time I've really shot a puck like that, and it's the first time in a long time that it went in,'' Getzlaf said.\n\nView gallery Anaheim Ducks' Jakob Silfverberg, left, of Sweden, shoots as he is defended by Philadelphia Flye \u2026\n\nJakub Voracek and Michael Raffl scored for the Flyers, playing for the first time since Monday's 4-3 home win over St. Louis. Mason stopped 33 shots in his fourth straight start.\n\nPerry avoided a check by Evgeny Medvedev along the right boards in the Flyers' zone and scored his team-high 13th goal of the season from short range just 58 seconds into the third period for a 3-2 lead while Schenn was screening Gibson.\n\n''Perry just comes in on my left-hand side, I'm in the right position, and he just sneaks it through the five-hole,'' Mason said. ''It should have been a pretty standard save. It's unfortunate that a 60-minute game came down to one shot, and obviously that was a turning point.''\n\nHorcoff gave the Ducks some insurance with 12:06 to play, scoring his seventh career short-handed goal on a breakaway while Vatanen was serving a holding penalty.\n\n''The PK's been great for us all year long, so it was nice to get rewarded with a goal there,'' Horcoff said. ''We take pride in it and work on it, and tonight it came up huge for us.''\n\nThe Flyers, 2 for 18 on the power play over their previous eight games, grabbed a 2-1 lead at 2:26 of the second period against a penalty-killing unit that came in leading the league with an 87.7 percentage. Raffl's fifth goal of the season came with 6 seconds left on Vatanen's holding infraction.\n\nPerry pulled the Ducks even at 4:14 of the period during a goalmouth scramble, a few seconds after Mason stopped his wraparound attempt. The goal came while Medvedev was off for hooking.\n\nNOTES: The Ducks hadn't scored more than two goals in any of their previous eight games.

A man, no matter how tough, can only take so many of those kinds of battles before his body gives out. It would not have been a stretch to believe that both fighters would be out for at least a year after such a grueling battle. But Lawler is back on Saturday, defending his title at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in the main event of UFC 195 against Carlos Condit.\n\nView gallery . Robbie Lawler (L) absorbs an elbow from Rory MacDonald. (AP)\n\n\u201cRobbie Lawler is, without doubt, one extremely tough human being,\u201d Condit said in tribute.\n\nLawler had originally agreed to defend his belt against Condit at UFC 194 on Dec. 12. But a right thumb injury he originally suffered during a high school wrestling match in 2000 required the bout to be postponed for three weeks.\n\nNow, for a guy who absorbed the kind of punishment that Lawler did against MacDonald and never stopped moving forward, it might seem odd to pull out of a fight because of a sore thumb.\n\nIf anyone has earned the benefit of the doubt, though, it\u2019s Lawler.\n\nHis right thumb is mangled, and doesn\u2019t sit straight up on a North-South line the way most folks\u2019 thumbs do. It starts up straight, juts a bit to the right, weaves back to the left and then finishes straight up.\n\nIt\u2019s a gnarled mess, but it\u2019s one of the hazards of the occupation.\n\n\u201cObviously after that [MacDonald] fight, it was real sore,\u201d Lawler told Yahoo Sports. \u201cEventually, it\u2019s going to get taken care of, but it looks like my face looked that night.\u201d\n\nHe laughed as he said it, and added, as he stuck his thumb out as if he were hitchhiking, \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not supposed to look like that, because this thumb doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not the thumb that is the real concern. The human body is not built to withstand a lot of blows to the head, and in the fight with MacDonald, Lawler took enough for more than one lifetime.\n\nAnyone who saw the new Will Smith movie \u201cConcussion\u201d understands the risk that those in a contact sport take.\n\nSmith played Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist who discovered that numerous football players had a disease known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy that was caused by repeated hits to the head.\n\nAnyone who has had repeated concussions is at risk to develop CTE. It can\u2019t be diagnosed until death, but its symptoms are similar to forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's.\n\nFighters in the modern age may not be at as great of a risk as football players, who compete on a weekly basis and thus take more shots to the head. Athletic commissions are neutral third parties designed, theoretically anyway, to protect the fighters from themselves. If a fighter has absorbed too many blows, they are supposed to be medically suspended and barred from having contact.\n\nThat allows the brain to heal and reduces, though not eliminates, the risk.\n\nThe UFC, as well as several boxing promoters, has funded a brain study led by neurologist Dr. Charles Bernick of the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. The goal of the study is to better understand the impact of blows to the head.\n\nView gallery . Lawler says he was back in the gym the Tuesday after the MacDonald fight. (AP)\n\nHe said that despite how he looked, he didn\u2019t feel too bad only a few days after the bout, and a week later, was able to do pretty much whatever he wanted.\n\nLawler was one of the bright young prospects in the early days of Zuffa\u2019s ownership of the UFC, but it took him more than a decade to fulfill that potential.\n\nHe learned by trial and error, but the key thing is that he learned. In his early days, he trained in Iowa at a camp where every sparring session was as intense as a fight.\n\nBut he learned eventually that there is little need to spar so vigorously and to push the body in training camp. Everything he does is geared toward being at his best for fight night, and that means less punishment absorbed in camp.\n\nNow, if he feels he needs a day or two off, he takes it. He remains among the sport\u2019s hardest workers, but he is working more efficiently and effectively than he has previously.\n\nHe faces a conundrum that so many of his peers do: In order to maximize his earnings, he\u2019s got to fight often and against the best fighters in the world on a regular basis. There are no tune-up fights or third-tier opponents in his world.\n\nIt\u2019s the Super Bowl every time out. Even the Patriots get to play lesser teams like the Browns every now and then, but for guys like Lawler, it\u2019s always one top seed after another.\n\nFans love the back-and-forth slugfests and speak of them in reverential tones decades later.\n\nThe fighters make the big bucks in those kinds of fights, but that may come at a price years later.\n\nFighters in the modern era aren\u2019t fighting as often as they did in the past and, consequently, their brains have a chance to recover. And not everyone who endures head trauma winds up with CTE or dementia. No one knows for sure why some people are afflicted and others aren\u2019t, but researchers like Bernick are trying to figure it out.\n\nIn the meantime, we praise athletes like Lawler and Condit as warriors and marvel at their toughness. We\u2019re awed by their conditioning and their desire for victory.\n\nWe simply hope that the price for that win isn\u2019t too great. The Lawler-Condit match is another in a string of terrific matchups the UFC has made over the last three months. The violence quotient in this fight figures to be high. Enjoy it.\n\nAnd then pray that no matter how swollen or bloody they may look in the fight\u2019s aftermath, there is no toll to be paid for their toughness down the line.", "Motor racing-Hamilton wants to give NASCAR a go": "By Alan Baldwin\n\nABU DHABI, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Triple Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton hopes to give NASCAR a go one day after singing the praises of the U.S. stock car series on Thursday.\n\nHamilton attended the season-ender at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida last weekend to witness the final race of his friend and four-times champion Jeff Gordon.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of his.

That has probably scared teams away.\n\nHis stats have been excellent, especially in the last two months of the 2015 season with the New York Mets.\n\nCespedes gave the Mets the offensive spark they needed, hitting 17 homers and driving in 44 runs in 57 games. He even got some MVP votes.\n\nHe\u2019s certainly an exciting player, but there are some cautionary signs.\n\nCespedes was traded three times in a year. Oakland traded him to Boston, and they moved him to Detroit, which sent him to the Mets.\n\nExcellent players aren\u2019t usually traded that often.\n\nHe plays left field, and the Orioles signed Kim, who\u2019s unproven at the major league level to play there. Cespedes has never played right field.\n\nIn 16 games in Baltimore, Cespedes has a .261 average with three home runs and 11 RBIs.\n\nIf he wants a one-year platform deal, perhaps the Orioles could sign him because he wasn\u2019t eligible for a qualifying offer. He\u2019ll probably have to settle for less than a six-year deal, but he should get a nice offer shortly after the New year begins.\n\nAs for Davis, we\u2019ll continue to wait.\n\nCATCHING UP: There were several moves over the past week:\n\n-Left-handed pitcher Edgar Olmos, who was claimed on waivers earlier this month from Seattle, was lost on waivers to the Chicago Cubs.\n\n-Tim Berry, who spent one night in the Orioles bullpen in June 2014, but didn\u2019t pitch, was claimed on waivers by Miami.\n\n-Infielder Rey Navarro, designated for assignment when Darren O\u2019Day was re-signed, was claimed on waivers by the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nThe Orioles currently have 39 players on their 40-man roster.\n\n-The Orioles re-signed pitcher Bobby Bundy to a minor league contract and also brought back outfielder Xavier Avery, signing him to a minor league contract.

Hisashi Iwakuma is headed back to the Mariners. (AP) Seattle Mariners announced they had reached a contract agreement with Iwakuma, for one season and two option years. Specific terms of the contract were not immediately available, but the guaranteed portion would be far less than $45 million.\n\nAt best the second option for the Dodgers, whose starting rotation is rather thin behind Clayton Kershaw, the 34-year-old Iwakuma returns to Seattle, where in four seasons he was 47-25 with a 3.17 ERA.\n\nIt is unclear what turned the Dodgers on Iwakuma, who, years ago, while pitching in Japan, endured shoulder soreness and elbow surgery, and in the past two seasons missed multiple starts because of finger and side muscle injuries. Regardless, the Dodgers in recent days hesitated because of medical concerns, and in that time the Mariners renewed their chase. Late Thursday night, while the Dodgers endeavored to restructure their original contract with Iwakuma, the Mariners agreed to a one-year contract with vesting options for 2017 and 2018, and Iwakuma instead would return to Seattle.\n\n\"We said from the start that Kuma was a priority for us,\" Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto said. \"Obviously the developments from the last few days allowed us to get back into the game.\"\n\nThe re-acquisition of Iwakuma kept up a frantic pace for the Mariners and Dipoto, who in a short time have added Wade Miley to their rotation, Steve Cishek, Joaquin Benoit and Evan Scribner to their bullpen, and Nori Aoki, Adam Lind, Chris Iannetta and Leonys Martin to the lineup.\n\nTime will tell where this leaves the Dodgers, whose rotation after Kershaw includes Brett Anderson, Alex Wood and a lot of questions.

(Getty Images) Phoenix Suns announced as much on Tuesday afternoon:\n\n[Follow Dunks Don't Lie on Tumblr: The best slams from all of basketball]\n\nPhoenix Suns guard Eric Bledsoe today underwent successful surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his left knee and will miss the remainder of the 2015-16 season. His prognosis is for a return to full playing status for the start of training camp next fall.\n\nBledsoe, who has worked through two previous surgeries in attempts to recover from a previous tear to his right meniscus, tore the cartilage in the left knee after a collision with Philadelphia 76ers big man Robert Covington. After being carried off the court, the Suns lost that contest to the lowly Sixers, Philadelphia\u2019s second win in 33 tries this season.\n\nThe Suns, after a game showing against Cleveland on Monday night, now stand at 12-21. If you think that mark stands as a massive setback for a team that somehow missed the playoffs in 2014 while winning 48 games, you\u2019d be right. The current Western Conference, however, still could field one or two sub-.500 teams for the first time since 1997, and these Suns are just three games out of the current bracket.\n\nBledsoe averaged 20.4 points, 6.1 assists, four rebounds and a pair of steals for a team that isn\u2019t playing in 1997, though. He had done well to adapt to the idea that new\u2019ish teammate Brandon Knight was a full-on point guard, as opposed to the sort of hybrid-guard Bledsoe played so well with in 2013-14 in the form of Goran Dragic. No team losing its leading scorer can be expected to compete at any level in a league that is already moving on.\n\nPair, no, couple, no team this with the uncertainty that comes with the franchise dumping two of its assistant coaches while considering the job security of head coach Jeff Hornacek (who has no contract beyond this season, per a team-declined option) alongside the ongoing drama with forward Markieff Morris, and you have one of the league\u2019s great messes.\n\nThe Suns asked Morris to apologize to his teammates and coaches prior to re-instating him as an active player, after Markieff apparently demurred following a text and Twitter \u201csry.\u201d The team already dealt what could have been a franchise-making pick for Knight while spending gobs of cap space on Chandler (who, to be fair, isn\u2019t at fault for his dip in production due to his age and lack of passing partners), and the team seems at odds with itself.\n\nLiterally, every part of itself. From owner to general manager to coach to players to, sadly, the squad\u2019s sidelined point guard. Bledsoe\u2019s injury is a serious one, and we may not see the same heights of the guard that delighted all of us so many times in 2013-14 again.\n\nHe\u2019s worked through this twice before, it should be noted. This might be a lost season for all involved in Phoenix, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a lost career or a lost run for this franchise.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nKelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Don't Lie on Yahoo Sports.

So it's a good time to quickly discuss what we learned from draft day as the season played out.\n\nTake note of the wounds still fresh in your mind now. Jot them down as reminders for 2016:\n\n---\n\nView gallery New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski , left, reaches for the ball as New York Jets cornerbac \u2026\n\nView gallery Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones (11) makes a catch against Carolina Panthers middle lineba \u2026\n\nPOSITION FOCUS\n\nView gallery Indianapolis Colts quarterbacks Matt Hasselbeck, left and Andrew Luck , right, talk to Miami Dolphins \u2026\n\nIt gets harder to stay true to drafting the best player when you notice your roster is thin at one position and the best options keep flying off the board. But stay with it.\n\nIn my longest-running league, I veered off course and took Melvin Gordon because I needed a running back. You can imagine how much I loved owning Gordon, he of the 217-touches-and-no-touchdowns season, while passing on best-available candidate DeAndre Hopkins. In fact, I'm going to need a bottle of Maalox just thinking about it now.\n\n---\n\nOPPORTUNITY ISN'T EVERYTHING\n\nDeMarco Murray seemed destined for big things when he joined Chip Kelly's quick-snap offense in Philadelphia. Instead, Murray wasn't the right fit and ended up in a jumbled backfield mess (and didn't play well even when he did get work).\n\nView gallery Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (12) is sacked by Arizona Cardinals outside linebacker A \u2026\n\nAnother example was Andre Johnson, who seemed set for at least one more good year while signing on to catch passes from fantasy star Andrew Luck. It was terrible, much like everything for fantasy players who invested in Colts.\n\n---\n\nWAIT ON QB\n\nBurning a high pick on Luck was a waste, and Aaron Rodgers' upside took a hit due to injuries around him. Meanwhile, guys like Andy Dalton, Carson Palmer, Blake Bortles, Derek Carr and Tyrod Taylor were either drafted late or not at all and averaged at least 17 points per game in standard leagues.\n\n---\n\nPROVE IT\n\nI still remember watching Dallas rookie Julius Jones emerge to run for 722 yards and seven touchdowns over the final six games of the 2004 season. He even averaged 27 carries a game. I was sold. I loved his upside and aim to grab guys on their ascent, so I spent a late-first round pick on him the following year.\n\nIt didn't take long to realize that the 2004 was Jones' high point.\n\nFast forward to 2015, and there were two running backs with a similar profile: Denver's C.J. Anderson and Cincinnati's Jeremy Hill. Both tore up NFL defenses through the second half of 2014 and entered this year with massive upside. And yet, both stunk.\n\nThe point: it might be worth letting someone else take the gamble on the guy who hasn't proven he can do the job at an elite level through a whole season.\n\nView gallery Houston Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins (10) goes up over Tennessee Titans cornerback Coty Sens \u2026\n\n---\n\nRB RETURNS\n\nThere were five running backs topping draft boards: Adrian Peterson, Eddie Lacy, Le'Veon Bell, Jamaal Charles and Marshawn Lynch. Yet Bell and Charles were lost early to injuries, Lynch had nagging injury trouble and Lacy never looked like himself, leaving only Peterson to provide a legit return on that investment.\n\nIt's harder than ever to argue for the ''proven runner'' over elite receivers Antonio Brown, Julio Jones and Odell Beckham Jr., or tight end Rob Gronkowski.\n\n---\n\nAND LASTLY\n\nThe fantasy gods were good to Cardinals and Panthers owners playing Week 17 championship games. With Carolina's loss at Atlanta on Sunday, that means both teams are fighting to lock down homefield advantage throughout the NFC playoffs.\n\nThat means full go for fantasy starters Cam Newton, Palmer, Greg Olsen, Larry Fitzgerald, David Johnson and Michael Floyd.

Projecting the 25-year-old's future is an ongoing struggle between trusting his undeniable ability on the court and lamenting his penchant for making rash decisions that take him out of the game and threaten the Kings' chances at winning. He's thrilling for right and wrong reasons, usually all at once.\n\n[Follow Dunks Don't Lie on Tumblr: The best slams from all of basketball]\n\nCousins's worst qualities popped up again Monday night a few minutes into the third quarter of the Kings' game against the rival Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena. He reached in to foul Stephen Curry at the 8:56 mark on a relatively uncontroversial call that saddled Cousins with his fifth personal and a lengthy stay on the bench. Yet he made the situation worse by complaining to the referees for not giving the foul to teammate Ben McLemore, earning him a technical. Cousins then ramped up his displeasure and received a second tech for the automatic ejection. Take a look:\n\nIt's possible to make a reasonable argument that Cousins received the first tech on reputation, but his image is so well established in NBA circles that it's natural to question why Cousins hasn't adjusted to that reality in order to keep himself out of trouble. He may get in trouble more than he deserves, but he also doesn't find a way to avoid it. As such, it's difficult for him to encounter trouble without an NBA analyst or two wondering when the Kings will trade him:\n\nI am of the opinion that tonight is the night that the Kings owner/execs will decide the Cousins era is over. Just my opinion. \u2014 david b. thorpe (@coachthorpe) December 29, 2015\n\nThe ejection was a shame, too, because Cousins had attracted attention mere moments before for this delightfully bizarre attempt at picking up Rajon Rondo by his leg:\n\nThe Kings rued his absence for much more concrete reasons. The dismissal preceded a 15-0 Golden State run that turned a two-point Sacramento lead into a 13-point deficit. The Warriors never looked back and won 122-103 without needing to play Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Andrew Bogut in the fourth.\n\nCurry was the star of the night, putting up a triple-double with 23 points (6-of-13 3FG), a career-high 14 rebounds, and 10 assists in only 30 minutes. Surprisingly, Curry was held scoreless until the final 3:15 of the first half. But the reigning MVP dominated with a 17-point barrage before the break:\n\nOmri Casspi nearly matched Curry over that same stretch, making four threes in the final three minutes of the half on his way to a career-high 36 points (13-of-18 FG, 9-of-12 3FG). Yet Casspi was the only King to make at least half his field-goal attempts as the team shot just 38.9 percent from the floor.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nEric Freeman is a writer for Ball Don't Lie on Yahoo Sports.

Yes, the Yankees should hope that the player they just acquired, the reliever with the fastest fastball in the league, will miss a significant portion of the 2016 season. Forty games, in fact.\n\nView photo . (Getty Images) first reported by Yahoo Sports. Chapman admitted to police that he fired eight rounds from his gun into his garage in the aftermath, but was not charged with a crime nor arrested.\n\n[Related: Cuban pitcher Yaisel Sierra is now officially a free agent]\n\nMLB's investigation is different than law enforcement's, and we aren't sure what to expect yet. MLB put in a place a new domestic violence policy in August. The new policy gives Manfred the ultimate power to hand down whatever punishment he deems appropriate. Chapman is the third player to be investigated under MLB's new protocols (in addition to Jose Reyes and Yasiel Puig), but no punishments have been made yet, so predicting what the commish might have in store for Chapman is impossible.\n\nThere are two reasons the Yankees should hope the league doesn't go easy on Chapman, the second having more to do with baseball than the first:\n\n1. It's better PR if Chapman doesn't skate free. Let's face it, even though these current Yankees aren't exactly the Yankees of yesteryear, they're still looked at as the \"Evil Empire\" of baseball. Trading for the offseason's biggest villain, even if it makes baseball sense, is still going to make some people compare them to Dallas Cowboys signing Greg Hardy. Strictly from a we're-decent-people standpoint, they should want Chapman to be punished appropriately if MLB's investigation finds that he deserves it. Domestic violence isn't OK, no matter how famous you are or how fast you can throw a baseball. The Yankees already employ one of the MLB's most-hated players in Alex Rodriguez and they're probably not trying to form the Legion of Doom in the Bronx.\n\n2. They could keep him another year. If we're strictly talking baseball \u2014 ignoring the altruistic arguments and just looking at on-the-field importance \u2014 this is the most important part. A lengthy suspension could mean that Chapman's free agency gets pushed back a season. He's due to become a free agent after the 2016 season, which made him such a worthwhile trade chip for the Reds before the domestic-violence investigation hit the news. But MLB free agency is based on service time and if Chapman is suspended long enough, he might not reach the six years of major-league service time needed for free agency.\n\nJon Morosi of Fox Sports wrote about this idea earlier this month, saying the uncertain service time stoppage is why some teams were still interested in Chapman. As it stands, Chapman has five years and 34 days of major-league service time. He needs 138 more days on an active roster this season to reach free agency. If Chapman doesn't, then the Yankees would keep him, under salary arbitration, for 2017. That makes the trade much more appealing from a baseball perspective.\n\nKeep in mind, we're talking about days not games when calculating service time. Off days count. The Yankees' season is 182 days long, meaning that if Chapman is suspended 45 days or more, his free agency is delayed. Starting from opening day and counting forward 45 days to May 18, that would be 40 games.\n\n[Elsewhere: Have the Cardinals been rattled by fast-rising Cubs?]\n\nThe Yankees are a team that has the luxury of starting next season with two elite relievers, Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances, in their bullpen (barring a trade, of course). So losing Chapman for 40 games wouldn't be the blow that it might be to, say, the Los Angeles Dodgers. Especially if the Yanks are getting Chapman for another season afterward.\n\nThere have been rumors all winter that the Yankees would trade Miller if the return is right, but now having Chapman allows them another possibility. They can keep Miller and see how the Chapman saga plays out. If Chapman misses 40 or more games and the Yankees see a viable trade market, they can trade Miller this summer, once Chapman returns and when teams eyeing the playoffs could be even hungrier for relief pitching. That's just one scenario, though. This could go a number of ways for the Yankees. And no matter what else happens, two years of Chapman is good for baseball in the Bronx.\n\nDon't expect the Yankees to run around announcing to the world that they're hoping Chapman gets a 40-game suspension, but it would certainly be in their best interest if it happens.\n\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nMike Oz is the editor of Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.

After Point funding, you should still own at least 20% of the equity in your home\n\nyou live in one of the areas where Point is currently available\n\nwe reach agreement with you on a fair value for your property\n\nyou will sell the home within the term of your Point Homeowner Agreement or you will be in a position to repay Point at the end of the term This is taken from Point\u2019s website\n\nThe basic idea is that you sell a fraction of the equity/ownership of your home to Point. You will still have to maintain it and service all of the debt on the home, but beyond that, you can live in your home rent-free. When you sell the property, Point gets its share of the sales price. According to the Bloomberg article:\n\nWith Point, credit scores can be less than 620, but homeowners must have at least 25 percent to 30 percent equity in their houses. Point adjusts the cost of its investment based on the owner and the property, taking a larger percentage of price appreciation from riskier customers. Should the homeowner not pay Point, the firm has the right to sell the home to recoup its investment and take its portion of the gains. Those who decide not to sell their homes have to pay the company back at the end of the 10-year period, similar to a loan, with an annual effective interest rate that\u2019s capped at about 15 percent, comparable to rates on some credit cards or unsecured consumer debt. Annual percentage rates at LendingClub range from 5.32 percent to almost 30 percent on three-year personal loans. Point is investing in properties it expects to appreciate in value, initially focusing on California, with plans to fund homeowners in other states next year, according to a company marketing document.\n\nRepayment with appreciation occurs at the earlier of the end of a 10-year term, sale of the property, or the will of the owner to buy out Point\u2019s stake at the appraised value.\n\nSo, what could go wrong?\n\nPersonally, I like the idea of selling an equity interest because it delevers the owner. The owner does not have to make any additional payments. He forfeits some appreciation of the property, and faces either a need for liquidity or a sale of the property 10 years out. (The 10-year limit is probably due to a need to repay Point\u2019s own property investors.)\n\nPossible issues: you might not like the price to buy out Point should you ever get the resources to do so. You may not want to sell the property 10 years out if you realize that you can\u2019t raise the liquidity to buy out Point. If you do sell your home, you will incur costs, and may have a hard time buying a similar home in the market that you are in with the proceeds.\n\nBut on the whole, I like the idea, and think that it could become an alternative to reverse mortgages in some markets where properties are appreciating. An alternative to that odious product would be welcome.\n\nFull disclosure: I don\u2019t have any financial dealings with Point. I just think it is an interesting idea.\n\nSell a Fraction of Your Home? was originally published on The Aleph Blog", "Cardinals sack Rodgers 8 times, rout Packers 38-8": "NFL Media's Judy Battista joins \"Around the NFL\" to share how the New York Jets have elevated their game and explains why the Jets\u2019 offense has been the key to their recent success.\n\nAre the Jets peaking at the right time?\n\nHow bad is AJ McCarron's wrist injury?

(AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals flattened Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers on Sunday.\n\nThat makes it nine straight wins for the Cardinals, who think they're still gaining steam.\n\n''You want to play your best ball at the end of the season,'' Arizona defensive lineman Calais Campbell said, ''and I think this is the best game we've played.''\n\nThe Cardinals sacked Rodgers eight times and returned two of his fumbles for touchdowns in a dominant 38-8 victory.\n\nCarson Palmer threw for 257 yards and two touchdowns for the Cardinals (13-2). The winning streak is the franchise's longest since the 1948 Chicago Cardinals won 10 in a row.\n\nGreen Bay was without starting left tackle David Bakhtiari with an injury and lost starting right tackle Bryan Bulaga to an ankle injury during the game.\n\nSo the Packers (10-5) were in no position to slow the rout.\n\n''They were very aggressive to the line of scrimmage,'' Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy said. ''They played very well and took advantage of it.''\n\nIn all, Packers quarterbacks were sacked nine times in their most one-sided loss of the season. Dwight Freeney had three and Campbell 2 1/2. Cory Redding rambled 36 yards with one of the fumbles for a score, and Jerraud Powers took another 5 yards for a touchdown.\n\nThe Packers dropped into a tie with Minnesota for the NFC North lead when the Vikings cruised to a 49-17 victory over the New York Giants on Sunday night. Green Bay hosts Minnesota in its regular-season finale next Sunday.\n\n''This was a playoff-style game and we played terrible,'' Rodgers said, ''but we have won a lot of games here. When you play long enough you are going to be on the wrong side at times, but I am confident that we have guys and myself that, when it matters for all the marbles, guys will show up.''\n\nThe nine sacks were the most for the Cardinals since they had 10 against Philadelphia on Dec. 7, 1986, two years before the franchise moved to Arizona.\n\nArizona clinched at least the No. 2 playoff seed in the NFC. It still can take the No. 1 seed with a win over Seattle and a Carolina loss to Tampa Bay next weekend.\n\n''We still really haven't done anything other than get a bye,'' Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said. ''You don't get rings for byes; you only get T-shirts and hats.''\n\nPalmer completed 18 of 27 passes and was intercepted once. Michael Floyd caught six passes for 111 yards for the Cardinals, who entered the game with the NFL's No. 1-ranked offense.\n\nRodgers was 15 for 28 for 151 yards and a touchdown with one interception.\n\nThe game was close until a big reversal of fortune in the final minute of the first half.\n\nWith Arizona leading 10-0, Palmer attempted to lob a screen pass to David Johnson near the line of scrimmage but Mike Daniels, the Packers' 6-foot, 310-pound defensive tackle, picked it off and Green Bay had the ball on the Arizona 15.\n\nBut on third-and-goal at the 10, Justin Bethel stepped in front of intended receiver James Jones and intercepted the pass in the end zone. Rodgers' seventh interception of the season gave the Cardinals the ball at the 20 with 57 seconds to play.\n\nA 47-yard pass to Floyd advanced the ball to the 33 and two more completions, plus a defensive holding call, set up Palmer's 7-yard scoring pass to John Brown, putting Arizona ahead 17-0.\n\nThings just got worse for the Packers from there.\n\nOn the first play from scrimmage in the second half, Green Bay's James Starks fumbled and Powers recovered at the Packers 28. Palmer threw 14 yards to Floyd, and then Johnson ran 14 yards for a score to make it 24-0.\n\nThe 6-foot-4, 318-pound Redding's TD made it 31-0.\n\nNOTES: Freeney made an extra $300,000 in incentives with his three sacks. ...

(AP) -- Meadowlark Lemon, the ''clown prince'' of basketball's barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters, whose blend of hook shots and humor brought joy to millions of fans around the world, has died. He was 83.\n\nLemon's wife and daughter confirmed to the team that he died Sunday in Scottsdale, Arizona, Globetrotters spokesman Brett Meister said Monday. Meister did not know the cause of death.\n\nThough skilled enough to play professionally, Lemon instead wanted to entertain, his dream of playing for the Globetrotters hatched after watching a newsreel of the all-black team at a cinema house when he was 11.\n\nLemon ended up becoming arguably the team's most popular player, a showman known as much for his confetti-in-the-water-bucket routine and slapstick comedy as his half-court hook shots and no-look, behind-the-back passes.\n\nA sign of his crossover appeal, Lemon was inducted into both the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame and the International Clown Hall of Fame.\n\n''My destiny was to make people happy,'' Lemon said as he was inducted into the basketball hall as a contributor to the game in 2003.\n\nLemon played for the Globetrotters during the team's heyday from the mid-1950s to the late-1970s, delighting fans with his skills with a ball and a joke. Traveling by car, bus, train or plane nearly every night, Lemon covered nearly 4 million miles to play in over 100 countries and in front of popes and presidents, kings and queens. Known as the ''Clown Prince of Basketball,'' he averaged 325 games per year during his prime, that luminous smile never dimming.\n\n''Meadowlark was the most sensational, awesome, incredible basketball player I've ever seen,'' NBA great and former Globetrotter Wilt Chamberlain said shortly before his death in 1999. ''People would say it would be Dr. J or even (Michael) Jordan. For me it would be Meadowlark Lemon.''\n\nLemon spent 24 years with the Globetrotters, doing tours through the racially torn South in the 1950s until he left in 1979 to start his own team.\n\nHe was one of the most popular athletes in the world during the prime of his career, thanks to a unique blend of athleticism and showmanship.\n\nPlaying against the team's nightly foil, the Washington Generals, Lemon left fans in awe with an array of hook shots, no-look passes and the nifty moves he put on display during the Globetrotters' famous circle while ''Sweet Georgia Brown'' played over the loudspeaker.\n\nHe also had a knack for sending the fans home with a smile every night, whether it was with his running commentary, putting confetti in a water bucket or pulling down the pants of an ''unsuspecting'' referee.\n\n''We played serious games too, against the Olympic teams and the College All-Stars,'' Lemon said. ''But that didn't stop us from putting the comedy in there.''\n\nLemon became an icon in the 1970s, appearing in movies, including ''The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh,'' numerous talk shows and even a stint in the cartoon ''Scooby Doo,'' with Scatman Crothers doing his voice.\n\nAfter leaving the Globetrotters, Lemon started his own team, The Bucketeers, and played on a variety of teams before rejoining the Globetrotters for a short tour in 1994.\n\nLemon spent the last years of his life trying to spread a message of faith through basketball. He became an ordained minister in 1986 and was a motivational speaker, touring the country to meet with children at basketball camps and youth prisons with his Scottsdale-based Meadowlark Lemon Ministries.\n\n''I feel if I can touch a kid in youth prison, he won't go to the adult prison,'' Lemon said in 2003.\n\nHe never lost touch with his beloved sport. Lemon said he rose every day at 4 a.m. and, after prayers, headed for the gym to run sprints and practice shooting.\n\n''I have to keep that hook shot working,'' he said.\n\nBorn in 1932, Meadow George Lemon III - he lengthened his name after joining the Globetrotters - didn't have money for a basketball when he was young, so he rigged up a makeshift hoop in his backyard in Wilmington, North Carolina. Using a coat hanger and onion sack for the basket, he made his first shot with an empty milk can.\n\nLemon first contacted the Globetrotters before his high school graduation and joined the team in 1954. He missed a game in 1955 because of a bad bowl of goulash in Germany, but that was the last one. What followed was a run, by his calculations, of more than 16,000 straight games that took him to places he never could have imagined.\n\n''I was one of the most fortunate athletes that ever lived,'' he said. ''I was able to watch history.''", "Sources: Suns fire Jeff Hornacek's top two assistant coaches": "After owner Robert Sarver and general manager Ryan McDonough met with starting players and coaching staff on Sunday, management has fired two assistant coaches close to head coach Jeff Hornacek, league sources told Yahoo Sports.\n\nThe Suns fired top assistant, Mike Longabardi, along with Jerry Sichting on Sunday night, and Hornacek's future is teetering on the brink, league sources said.\n\nHornacek was adamantly against the dismissal of his staff, but appears that he\u2019ll decide to continue on the job, league sources told Yahoo Sports.\n\nView photo . Jeff Hornacek has a team option for the 2016-17 season left on his contract.

He started his college coaching career under Charlotte's Steve Clifford and his NBA career under Houston's Jeff Van Gundy.\n\nIn the wake of a humiliating loss to the 2-30 Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday night, the latest low in a stretch that has seen the Suns lose 10 of 15 games, Sarver and McDonough held individual meetings with players on Sunday, trying to gain a deeper understanding of the issues surrounding the team's spiral, league sources told Yahoo Sports.\n\nThe Suns are 12-20, and management and players are wondering whether Hornacek has lost his team.\n\nOwnership and management have been reluctant to fire Hornacek, affording him every chance to work the team out of its struggles, league sources said. Nevertheless, the firing of the assistant coaches was a shot close to Hornacek. Another assistant coach, Earl Watson, will move into a more prominent role on the Suns staff.

Magic Johnson made the comparison on the day Kobe announced his retirement, Kobe named MJ as one of the five best players he ever faced, and the eight games between the two are worth remembering even if none of them saw either legend at his best. Pretty much the only person who's ever shaken off the comparison is Kobe himself.\n\n[Follow Dunks Don't Lie on Tumblr: The best slams from all of basketball]\n\nSo it made more than a little sense that Jordan took the time to record a special message for Bryant that aired during the player introductions before Monday's tilt between the Los Angeles Lakers and the MJ-owned Charlotte Hornets at Time Warner Cable Arena. Take a look at the roughly two-minute clip here:\n\nIt's a fairly simple message \u2014 Jordan congratulates Bryant on his accomplishments, praises his competitive drive, and wishes him well as he tries to translate that mindset to his post-basketball life. However fabricated the sentiment may be, it's a nice moment between two of the greatest to ever play the game.\n\nHowever, Jordan still positions himself as the leader to Kobe's follower, referring to himself as a \"big brother\" figure and suggesting that the soon-to-be retiree will try to follow his example as a wildly successful businessman. These points are subtle, and maybe not even conscious for someone as competitive as Jordan, but present nonetheless.\n\nKobe followed this nice tribute with a pretty poor game \u2014 he shot 5-of-20 from the field and 3-of-12 from three-point range for an inefficient 20 points.

(AP) -- On a night when Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan paid tribute to Kobe Bryant, it was Kemba Walker who stole the spotlight.\n\nWalker scored 18 of his 38 points in the fourth quarter, and the Hornets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 108-98 Monday night in Bryant's final game in Charlotte against the team that drafted him - and promptly traded him - nearly 20 years ago.\n\nCody Zeller had 16 points and eight rebounds, and Nicolas Batum added 15 points and 11 assists for the Hornets, who have won two straight.\n\n''I just wanted to win. It was great to play against Kobe one last time in this arena, but it was also great to beat him,'' Walker said. ''I didn't want to be on the other end of him getting that W.''\n\nBryant, who received a taped message from Jordan before the game, finished with 20 points on 5-of-20 shooting.\n\nJordan didn't attend the game, but congratulated Bryant on an ''unbelievable career'' during a message that was played on the arena's scoreboard before tip-off. Jordan went on to cite Bryant's ''competitive drive'' the first time the two played against each other in 1996 and called it ''invigorating.''\n\n''You have been a big help to the game of basketball,'' Jordan said. ''You helped the NBA. You helped promote and I'm pretty sure you have fans all over the world. I am a big fan. I still love watching you play and I am very happy for you and what you have accomplished in the game.''\n\nThe Hornets drafted Bryant out of high school with the 13th overall pick in 1996, but traded him to the Lakers in a deal that brought Vlade Divac to Charlotte.\n\n''It was awesome,'' Bryant said of Jordan's message. ''We talk pretty often. But it was interesting to see my teammates before the game. Julius Randle was like, 'That's amazing. That's Michael Jordan.'''\n\nBryant, set to retire after the season, said he spoke to Jordan personally before the game. He said Jordan was on vacation.\n\n''He enjoys his vacation time,'' Bryant said. ''I told him I was a little jealous. And he said, 'You'll be here soon.'''\n\nBryant was just 3 of 12 from 3-point range and couldn't rally the Lakers late.\n\nHe managed to pull Los Angeles to 102-95 with a 3-pointer with 1:02 left - his first field goal of the second half - but Walker answered with a long 3 from the left wing.\n\nBryant left the game a few seconds later with the sold-out crowd chanting ''Kobe!

The fighter\u2019s original prototype first flew in 2011 and the entire program is expected to be operational by 2018. The jet unveiled last week is thought to be the first of a small run of planes intended for full military use.\n\nCompare that to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which has taken 20 years and cost nearly $400 billion to develop. The most expensive weapons effort in U.S. history flew its first production-line aircraft in 2011, five years after the prototype took off.\n\nIn terms of development time, that puts China\u2019s stealth fighter efforts \u2013 the J-20 and the J-31, which flew for the first time in 2012 -- ahead of the F-35 and the F-22 Raptor, a plane the U.S. has stopped producing but has used in hundreds of sorties in the Middle East.\n\nRelated: Congress Showers the F-35 Program with Cash\n\nOf course, Beijing may have had some help getting so far, so fast.\n\nChinese hackers are suspected of stealing the F-35\u2019s blueprints in 2009. U.S. officials said no classified information was taken in that breach, but in 2011 China disclosed it was building the J-31, a multirole stealth fighter that could hit targets in the sky and on the ground, much like the F-35.\n\nThe similarities between the J-20, which will be puts through its paces by the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), and the F-22 and the F-35 are undeniable. The Chinese platform has a high level of stealth and long-range electronic warfare capabilities, long selling points for the F-35.\n\nRelated: Are the Planets Aligned for a Revamp of the Pentagon\u2019s Top Brass?\n\nThe Chinese jet is expected to be equipped with a variety of long- and short-range missiles and could be networked with unmanned aerial vehicles in the future.\n\nSuch predictions should be taken with a grain of salt, however, given Beijing\u2019s tight grip on sensitive information and its penchant for using propaganda to promote an image of unparalleled strength to both domestic and international audiences.\n\nFor the time being, though, the J-20, combined with the J-31 and other aircraft currently under development, might give China air superiority over its Asian neighbors at the time when Beijing is taking aggressive steps to expand its footprint in the Pacific region.", "Why Instagram thinks its users love their ads": "Will Facebook wreck Instagram?\n\nThat\u2019s the concern some users have now that Facebook, which bought Instagram in 2012, has started running ads on the image-sharing site. Instagram had been ad-free since it started in 2010.\n\nFor now, the presence of ads on Instagram appears to be lighter than on Facebook, as the company gauges the reaction of users. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very careful to roll out ads in a measured way,\u201d says analyst Brian Blau of the Gartner Group. \u201cFacebook is a very fast innovator, but not necessarily with ads.\u201d\n\nWith annual net earnings of about $3 billion and a profit margin of 18%, Facebook\u2014the Yahoo Finance Company of the Year in 2015\u2014can afford to be patient. When CEO Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, many tech analysts were sure he overpaid. They were wrong. Less than four years later, Instagram is worth more than $20 billion, estimates Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. Within a couple of years, Facebook expects Instagram to contribute $2 billion or so to topline revenue.\n\nThe trick, of course, is rolling out ads to Instagram's 400 million users, without alienating them and sending them to the competition, like Pinterest and Snapchat. \u201cWe\u2019ve always put the Instagram community first,\u201d Marnie Levine, chief operating officer of Instagram, told us when we traveled to Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. in early December. \u201cAs we\u2019ve introduced advertising, we\u2019ve tried to listen to feedback of the community.\u201d\n\n[What do you think of the ads on Instagram? Sound off on the Yahoo Finance Facebook page.]\n\nLevine won\u2019t spell out exactly how Facebook evaluates user concerns, but she says targeting ads to users' interests is one way to provide something that\u2019s useful to them, instead of annoying. And Facebook may know more about its users\u2019 interests than any other digital service, thanks to all those likes and dislikes we register, plus all the other info that emerges as we follow and friend. For people who have both a Facebook and an Instagram account, there\u2019s even more data available on what kinds of ads we might actually want (or dislike the least).\n\nInstagram ads also have an \"X\" users can click, to kill the ad. Levine says. Do a lot of users do that? \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is just the opposite,\u201d Levine says. \u201cThere are some kinds of ads I hadn\u2019t expected would produce so much meaning to people on Instagram.\u201d One example she cites is a Capital One ad with the theme of \u201cwhat\u2019s in your wallet.\u201d For several weeks, the bank turned over its Instagram account to three ordinary users, who posted images of things found in their wallets. Facebook says the campaign resonated with Instagrammers, while Capital One says it was successful, too.\n\n[Check out our behind-the-scenes glimpse of life at Facebook.]\n\nTo some extent, experiments with advertising on Facebook, Instagram and other social networking sites will dictate the direction of advertising overall. The splashy image ads honed to perfection during the \"Mad Men\" era are fading, increasingly replaced by spots that inform, entertain and even let consumers provide some of the content. Advertisers want to know precisely what their ads accomplish and are no longer satisfied with vague assurances that ads merely enhance brand awareness.\n\nSocial ads, as those run on Facebook and Instagram are known, allow advertisers to measure effectiveness in real time, while also requiring them to offer something relevant. \u201cThey\u2019re targeted to people based on their likes and interests, so hopefully they\u2019re getting the right story at the right time,\u201d Levine says. If she\u2019s right, Instagram users should have no problems with ads at all.\n\nRick Newman\u2019s latest book is Liberty for All: A Manifesto for Reclaiming Financial and Political Freedom.

To help you avoid some potential Week 16 pitfalls (full season or daily), here's a few players I expect to look better/worse than usual on Saturday/Sunday/Monday. May you holiday wishes - touchdowns, touchdowns and more touchdowns - come true!\n\nSTARTS\n\nQB - Kirk Cousins, Was at Phi ($32 in DFS) - Cousins has been a top 6 fantasy QB since Week 7, throwing for 300-plus yards five times in that eight-game span. The health of DeSean Jackson has allowed the Redskins to finally stretch the field vertically. Against a Philly defense allowing the third-most fantasy points to the QB position, Cousins has top 10 upside this week.\n\n[Yahoo Daily Fantasy: $10 could win you $25K in our $250K contest for Week 16]\n\nRB - Rashad Jennings, NYG at Min ($14) - Jennings has handled a decisive lead role in the Giants' backfield committee the past two weeks, topping 100 total yards in both contests. With Odell Beckham Jr. out this week, Jennings should continue to be heavily involved in the offense against a Vikings defense that has allowed a RB to top 100 total yards in five straight games.\n\nRB - Karlos Williams, Buf vs. Dal ($18) - While Mike Gilislee is likely to figure into the mix, I expect Williams to handle the majority of backfield touches this week for the No. 9 scoring fantasy backfield. Against a Dallas defense that has allowed the sixth-most fantasy PPG to running backs, Williams could be one of the surprise Week 16 heroes of fantasy.\n\nView gallery FILE - In this Dec. 20, 2015, file photo, Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins (8) celebrate \u2026\n\nWR - Kamar Aiken, Bal vs. Pit ($23) - I love the way Aiken, week in and week out, makes tough catches in traffic. He's just a rock solid player, and he happens to have a nice matchup against a Steelers secondary that he hung a 5/77/1 line on back in Week 4. The Steelers have only regressed in pass defense since then, as they allow the second-most fantasy PPG to the WR position.\n\n\n\nWR - Randall Cobb, GB at Ari ($19) - Without Tyrann Mathieu (ACL), Arizona could struggle this week at defending the slot, which is where Cobb typically lines up. Figure the Packers will have to throw plenty to keep pace with an Arizona offense averaging 31.8 PPG, and Cobb is likely to be the recipient of a healthy amount of targets.\n\nTE - Will Tye, NYG at Min ($12) - Minnesota is average at defending the tight end in fantasy, so this isn't really about the matchup for Tye, though it's certainly not a red light. This is about Odell Beckham Jr. sitting out this week, and the need for other players, like Jennings (above) and Tye, to step up. With no ODB, I expect the G-Men to go with a more conservative offensive approach, leaning on the backfield and short/intermediate range targets (Tye). The Giants' rookie has been the No. 9 fantasy tight end for the past month, and he looks poised to hit top 10 territory once again this week.\n\n[Week 16 rankings: Quarterback | Running Back | Receiver | Tight End | Flex | All Positions]\n\nSITS\n\nQB - Eli Manning, NYG at Min ($31) - No Odell Beckham Jr. (suspended) makes that Giants passing game look pretty non-threatening. Rueben Randle ... Will Tye ... Dwayne Harris? Sure, there's sleeper potential there, but not the kind of firepower that is going to drive Manning back into QB1 territory this week.\n\nRB - Todd Gurley, StL at Sea ($22) - It may be tough to sit Gurley, but the strikes against him this week are numerous. The Rams have averaged just 13.7 points per game on the road. And Gurley has averaged about one less yard per carry on the road. And the trip they take this week is more daunting than usual, heading to Seattle to face the toughest defense in fantasy against opposing running backs. The Seahawks have not allowed a RB to reach 66 rushing yards for eight consecutive games (including Adrian Peterson), and Gurley has only topped that number once in his past six contests.\n\nRB - Tim Hightower, NO at Jac ($21 - Can't argue Hightower's volume, but he's needed that workload, and maybe a bit of garbage time, to maintain any kind of fantasy relevance since assuming the starting role after Mark Ingram was lost for the season with injury. I don't hold out much hope of this plodder getting much done on the ground against a Jacksonville defense that allows just 3.4 YPC to opposing running backs.\n\nWR - A.J. Green, Cin at Den ($23) - Don't tell me Green is matchup proof. He's played 14 games, and has finished as a top 25 receiver just five times. Of those top 25 finishes, four came against defenses among the top 5 most generous to opposing WRs in fantasy. Green faces the toughest defense against the pass this week. And then there's A.J. McCarron behind center, and no Tyler Eifert to divert safety attention, and ... let's just say that Green is not a good bet for top 25 status this week.\n\n\n\nWR - Emmanuel Sanders, Den vs. Cin ($20) - Cincy is also a legit pass defense, having yielded the fewest pass plays of 20-plus yards (35). And much like Green (above) has taken advantage of the pass D weaklings of the league, same goes for Sanders - his top 4 fantasy games, and the only ones in which he found the end zone, came against teams ranked among the six most generous in fantasy to opposing WRs. Remember, before blowing up last week at Pittsburgh, Sanders had finished under 20 yards in three of the previous four games.\n\n\n\nTE - Zach Ertz, Phi vs. Was ($14) - Ertz has been a top 5 fantasy TE over the past three weeks, but Washington had his number in the previous meeting (2 catches, 11 yards in Week 4). In fact, the Redskins have had most tight ends' number, as only three tight ends have reached even 7.5 fantasy points against them this season.", "Vinik confident on Stamkos deal; Patriot Place primer; Sedin in a manger (Puck Headlines)": "Here are your Puck Headlines: A glorious collection of news and views collected from the greatest blogosphere in sports and the few, the proud, the mainstream hockey media.

McCown kept playing despite taking a big hit in the second half, but had to leave the field after throwing an incompletion in the fourth quarter.\n\nPHOENIX (AP) - Arizona placed Chris Johnson on the injured reserve/designated to return list, a move that means the only way the running back will play again this season is if the Cardinals reach the Super Bowl.\n\nArizona coach Bruce Arians said Monday that Johnson was hurt when he took a helmet to the knee in Sunday's 19-13 victory at San Francisco.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The NFL moved referee Pete Morelli's crew off the upcoming Sunday night game between Indianapolis and Pittsburgh. Instead, the crew will work an afternoon game between the Eagles and Patriots. Morelli's group was heavily criticized by both sides after the 49ers-Cardinals game Sunday.\n\nBASEBALL\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Dodgers great Don Newcombe was resting comfortably at home after fainting at the ballpark.\n\nThe 89-year-old former pitcher was on hand at an introductory news conference to welcome Dave Roberts as the club's first minority manager.

The money was due only if Park signed with the Twins.\n\nPark hit .343 with 53 homers and 146 RBIs this year.

(AP) - No. 19 Arizona will be without center Kaleb Tarczewski for four to six weeks because of a stress reaction and strained muscle in his left foot.\n\nTarczewski was injured in the opening game of the Wooden Legacy against Santa Clara last Thursday and missed the final two games of the tournament. The 7-foot senior center averaged 8.6 and 7.2 rebounds through Arizona's first five games. Arizona lost to Providence and Boise State without Tarczewski.\n\nTarczewski has been Arizona's starting center for four seasons and has a chance to win more games than any player in school history.\n\nSOCCER\n\nLONDON (AP) - Five World Cup sponsors have written to FIFA's executive committee demanding ''independent oversight'' of the reform process in their latest intervention that highlights concerns about their links to soccer's scandal-battered governing body.\n\nSponsors were originally promised places on the FIFA reform committee. But instead of being invited into meetings discussing the overhaul of the organization, they have been offered seats only on an advisory board which is yet to be appointed.\n\nThe sponsors' letter was sent from Adidas, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Visa, and Budweiser brewer AB InBev to FIFA's ruling body ahead of meetings this week when a final slate of reform proposals will be discussed.\n\nThe reform panel was established following the indictment of soccer officials by American authorities for bribery, but the sponsors appear to have reservations about its independence.\n\nBOXING\n\nLITTLE ROCK, Ark.

Plenty of big-name receivers can\u2019t help us during Championship Week.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look around, starting with the receiver position.\n\n\u2022 Dez Bryant (foot) was downgraded to doubtful, and it would be a surprise if he played again this year. Cole Beasley (knee/illness) is listed as questionable. Also keep in mind Kellen Moore is the new starting quarterback for the Cowboys.\n\n[Yahoo Daily Fantasy: $10 could win you $25K in our $250K contest for Week 16]\n\n\u2022 Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) is listed as doubtful for Sunday\u2019s game at Tampa Bay. Maybe Matt Forte and Zach Miller will pick up some of the pass-catching slack. If you were desperate upon desperate,. perhaps you could consider Eddie Royal as a fill-in, though he\u2019s dealing with a sore knee of his own.\n\n\u2022 As you surely know by now, Odell Beckham Jr. (suspension) will not play at Minnesota. The Giants also aren\u2019t sure about Dwayne Harris (shoulder), who had a limited week. Rueben Randle is the only playable option here, if you dare to trust any of the New York wideouts. Tight end Will Tye might also be in for some extra work.\n\n\u2022 Doug Baldwin (hamstring) had a full practice Friday, though he still is a game-time decision for Sunday\u2019s late game against St. Louis. I\u2019d be surprised if Baldwin doesn\u2019t go, but make sure you have a late-game pivot option, just in case.\n\n\u2022 Bill Belichick put a chunk of his roster on the injury report, his usual MO. Julian Edelman (foot) is unlikely to go against the Jets, and the Boston Globe says Danny Amendola (knee) is also expected to sit. Brandon LaFell (foot) and Scott Chandler (knee) are listed as questionable.\n\n\u2022 The Lions list Calvin Johnson (ankle) as questionable. He had three straight days of limited practice. The 49ers present a wonderful matchup, but Johnson has been held to five catches for 79 yards over his last three games.\n\n\u2022 Vincent Jackson (knee) is out for another week. Maybe this will help Mike Evans get going, maybe not.\n\n\u2022 The Bengals must feel pretty good about A.J. Green\u2019s back issue, because he\u2019s not listed on the injury report. He\u2019s nonetheless in for a major challenge Monday at Denver.\n\n\u2022 Donte Moncrief is dealing with a sore toe, though he had a partial session Friday. He\u2019s listed as questionable.\n\n\u2022 Rishard Matthews (ribs) might be able to play for Miami, which could steal some targets from DeVante Parker and Jarvis Landry.\n\n\u2022 Tyler Eifert (post concussion) won\u2019t play Monday at Denver.\n\n\u2022 With Jonathan Stewart (foot) out again, Cameron Artis-Payne is set to start at Atlanta.\n\n\u2022 Adrian Peterson (ankle) had a full workout Friday and is listed as probable for the Sunday nighter against the Giants.\n\n[Week 16 rankings: Quarterback | Running Back | Receiver | Tight End | Flex | All Positions]\n\n\u2022 Shaun Draughn (knee) won\u2019t play at Detroit, which means the Niners downshift to Kendall Gaskins and DuJuan Harris.\n\n\u2022 LeSean McCoy (knee) won\u2019t dress against Dallas. Karlos Williams and Mike Gillislee are the fallback options.\n\n\u2022 T.J. Yeldon (knee) hasn\u2019t been working all week, so it looks like Denard Robinson will get the cushy start at New Orleans.\n\n\u2022 Duke Johnson Jr. (hamstring) had a limited practice week, not that anyone wants to use him at Kansas City.\n\n\u2022 Although Drew Brees (foot) is listed as questionable, the veteran QB continues to insist he\u2019ll play Sunday against Jacksonville.

The Titans will go with Zach Mettenberger; Marcus Mariota (knee) is out for the season.\n\n\u2022 Andrew Luck (kidney) won\u2019t play at Miami. Although Matt Hasselbeck isn\u2019t close to healthy, he\u2019s slated to get the start.\n\n\u2022 The Ravens are being coy about their starting quarterback; Jimmy Clausen and Ryan Mallett are the two options.

He raced to recover it, but Ware swept past right tackle Andrew Smith and secured Denver's fifth consecutive trip to the postseason.\n\n''It was my fault. I told the team that,'' McCarron said. ''I looked up to see the coverage and the snap caught me by surprise.''\n\nMcCarron also hurt his left wrist on the play and wrapped it afterward. He said he wasn't sure how bad it's hurt, but ''I'll get it checked out tomorrow and we'll see.''\n\nThis was just the big play Ware's been looking for ever since missing a month with a bad back.\n\n''Felt great to finish the game that way,'' Ware said. ''We thought we were going to finish it with the field goal but at the end of the game, it's all about that win.''\n\nWare's recovery followed a 37-yard field goal by Brandon McManus, whose shanked 45-yarder at the end of regulation made necessary the extra drama.\n\n''I'm 24 years old and I don't think I've ever kicked the ball like that in my life: grade school, elementary school, or anything like that,'' McManus said. ''I just wrapped my toe around it and I knew I had to bounce back.''\n\nHe did, helping the Broncos (11-4) overcome a 14-0 first-half deficit and denying the Bengals (11-4) their first road win on a Monday night since 1990.\n\n''There's an old saying: 'It's not how you start, it's how you finish,''' Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler said. ''And this team finished great tonight.''\n\nThe Bengals blew a chance to earn a bye in the playoffs and move ahead of the New England Patriots in the race for the AFC's top seed.\n\n''We knew what we have in front of us, an opportunity to get the bye,'' said Carlos Dunlap, who collected all three sacks of Osweiler. ''It is what it is now. Now we're going to move on.''\n\nDenver, which was in danger of becoming the first team since the 1970 merger to miss the playoffs after starting 10-2, snapped a two-game skid with its third overtime win of the season.\n\nNow, the Broncos can earn the top seed in the AFC with a win over San Diego and a loss by New England at Miami next weekend.\n\n''We've won in a lot of ways this year,'' Broncos safety T.J. Ward said. ''Overtime, game-winning field goals, blocked field goals, strips, fumble recoveries. When you get down to the playoffs you're going to need all those type of wins.''\n\nMcManus has missed a kick in five consecutive games, and this one wasn't even close. It sailed wide left - missing the protective netting - to the astonishment of 74,511 fans even though the flags atop the goal posts revealed a complete lack of wind.\n\nThe relieved Bengals called tails but the coin landed heads.\n\nUnlike Patriots coach Bill Belichick a day earlier, Broncos coach Gary Kubiak chose to receive, and Denver drove 60 yards in 13 plays. Osweiler, making his sixth straight start in place of Peyton Manning, played with a sore left shoulder and banged his left elbow in the frenetic final minutes but stayed in.\n\n''Coming into the game, I was a little bit banged up. Coming out of the game I'm a little bit banged up. But that's football,'' said Osweiler, who will get the start against the Chargers next week, too.\n\nMcCarron drove the Bengals on two long first-half drives, covering 80 and 90 yards and eating up a total of 16:24 to put Cincinnati ahead 14-0. He threw a 5-yard TD pass to A.J. Green and Mohamed Sanu scooted in from 6 yards out on a direct snap.\n\nAfter that, he found it tough to sustain drives against Denver's defense, which is ranked No. 1 against both the run and the pass and held McCarron to 200 yards passing and the Bengals to 3.3 yards a carry.\n\nThe Broncos pulled to 14-3 at halftime on McManus' short field goal, and the Broncos came out in hurry-up mode and were a different team in the second half - a reversal of last week at Pittsburgh, where they jumped out to a 17-point lead but were outscored 24-0 after the break.\n\nOsweiler connected with Sanders on a short TD throw for Denver's first third-quarter points since Nov. 8 at Indianapolis, and C.J. Anderson gave the Broncos their first lead when he broke free for a 39-yard touchdown run with 11:17 remaining.\n\nAfter Mike Nugent's 52-yard field goal tied it with 6:45 remaining, the Broncos twice drove to the Bengals 26 only to come away empty, once on Anderson's fumble and then on McManus' miss.\n\n''We told him if you get another chance take advantage of it and he did,'' Demaryius Thomas said. ''That's what won the game.''\n\nThat, and Ware's huge play moments later.\n\nNotes: Cincinnati came in allowing the fewest points in the NFL and Denver the fewest yards. This was only the third time two teams have met in December with those stats. ...

Three putts.\n\nJust like that, the U.S. Open had slipped away from Dustin Johnson and into the hands of Jordan Spieth.\n\nJohnson reached the par-5 -- that day, at least -- 18th hole at Chambers Bay outside of Tacoma, Wash., in two. He was 8 feet or so away from a 72nd-hole eagle that would give him the U.S. Open, his first major title, and a chance to shed the vexing label, in some circles, of being the best golfer in the world without a major title.\n\nIt was a tricky eagle bid, one, frankly, unlikely to go in the hole. However, a simple two-putt would land Johnson a spot in what seemed like an inevitable 18-hole Monday playoff with Spieth. Coax it down, tap it in and play for another day.\n\nJohnson was too aggressive with the first putt, letting it slip by some 3 feet. He didn't take a whole lot of time over this most crucial of short putts and, sure enough, he missed it. Spieth won his second major of the year thanks to a three-putt par. Yet again, Johnson had come up short in a major. First it was Bunkergate at the 2010 PGA Championship. Then it was a 2-iron out of bounds on the back nine of the final round of the 2011 British Open. The third time was supposed to be the charm. It wasn't.\n\nThe South Carolina native looked upset, more stunned than anything. He seemed to find comfort in his fiancee, Paulina Gretzky, and their infant son. Nonetheless, how could Johnson get over yet another crushing defeat?\n\nLike he always has.\n\nAP writer Doug Ferguson relays what Johnson's future father-in-law, hockey legend Wayne, told him about how Johnson handled the day after that Chambers choke.

This week: Setting the bar after Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods", "Admit it: 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' stinks -- and here's why": "On Christmas Day, I fulfilled my duty as an American consumer and took the family to see the new \"Star Wars\" movie. The excursion solved a mystery: Why do so many of the reviews, even the enthusiastic ones, carry an undertone of disappointment?\n\nThe simple answer is that \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" is not very good. It's professionally made in the sense that it displays an industrial level of Quality Control. But it's depressingly unimaginative and dull in long stretches, and -- crucially -- reproduces George Lucas' original 1977 movie slavishly almost to the point of plagiarism.\n\nThis isn't to say that it's not an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. If you're among the millions who plainly have done so, bless your heart. The issue, however, is whether \"The Force Awakens\" even deserves to be considered as a movie, because it's not. It's the anchoring element of a vast commercial program, painstakingly factory-made for maximal audience appeal, which means maximal inoffensiveness. The result tells us a lot about the state of entertainment today, and about the future of Hollywood.\n\nJoin the conversation on Facebook >>\n\nThe most important thing to know about \"The Force Awakens\" is that it's the first \"Star Wars\" feature produced by the Walt Disney Co. since its $4-billion acquisition of Lucas' production company, Lucasfilm, in 2012. The deal reflected Disney Chairman Robert Iger's strategy to snarf up the best franchise-oriented producers, including Pixar (acquired in 2006 for $7.4 billion) and Marvel (acquired in 2009 for $4 billion).\n\nFairy tale rubbish but could be interesting perhaps. - Alec Guinness on \"Star Wars,\" before accepting the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi\n\nFor \"Star Wars\" fans, the good thing about the deal was that it placed the franchise in the hands of experts committed to delivering professionally produced mass entertainment; the downside, as became clear only with the release of the new movie, was Disney's formula-bound assembly line for its major properties.\n\n\"Star Wars\" already was a merchandising bonanza, as Lucas had kept control of the licensing when he sold the first film to 20th Century Fox. Under Disney, at a minimum, there will be more of the same--toys, collectibles, theme park rides, video games, TV spinoffs, clothing, promotional tie-ins. Disney just announced that it will close 10 attractions and restaurants at Disneyland to build a new \"Star Wars\" area. (It won't be rescinding its recent 31% hike in the price of Disneyland passes in the interim, however.)\n\nBefore the 1999 release of \"The Phantom Menace,\" Lucas' first \"prequel\" to \"Star Wars,\" the cultural commentator Louis Menand reported that commercial licensing connected to the film had been so lucrative that it would turn a profit even if no one went to see it. The same is probably true of \"The Force Awakens,\" which is expected to generate up to $5 billion in merchandise sales in 2015 alone. But there's no need to validate the claim, since the film has already sold more than $544 million in tickets.\n\nProducing the hub of such a vast commercial undertaking brings its own pressures. Whether out of his own instincts or via directives from the suits at Disney, J.J. Abrams, the co-writer and director of \"The Force Awakens,\" plainly labored under a mandate to not get the thing wrong. Lucas had, in the three widely derided \"prequels\" starting with \"The Phantom Menace\" in 1999, and made money anyway. But there was no telling how long the franchise's momentum would last if the movies continued to deteriorate with Disney's nominees, not Lucas, at the helm.\n\nAbrams seems to follow the precept that the surest way to keep from putting a foot wrong is to walk only within the footprints of one's predecessors. As has been noted by a few reviewers who braved the intimidating weight of \"Star Wars: the Phenomenon\" to write critical pans, the new movie obsequiously replicates the formula of the original -- its set pieces, rhythm, pacing, even dialogue -- almost without advancing the story at all. It's a mark of Disney's own caretaker mentality that not only is a Jar Jar Binks-level blunder absent from \"The Force Awakens,\" but so is surprise or even much suspense. One has to be a pretty inattentive viewer to be surprised or shocked by either the big reveal in the story (no spoilers!) or its denouement.\n\nAbrams' big advance is said to be supplanting the whiter-than-white protagonists of the original \"Star Wars\" with a young woman and a black male. This hardly is a cinematic breakthrough, as other moviemakers who understand the demands of a gender- and culturally diverse audience have been doing it for years. But as a \"rebooting,\" the term ubiquitously applied to \"The Force Awakens,\" it feels entirely market-oriented, the way the Tide logo gets periodically redesigned to look fresh or the trademark figures of Betty Crocker and the Gerber Foods mom are redrawn to stay \"modern.\" But redesigning logos and brand icons is a technique drawn from Madison Avenue, not traditional moviemaking.\n\nIt's commonly said that the original \"Star Wars\" changed Hollywood, and that's true. But it didn't change the movies the way \"Bonnie & Clyde\" (1967), \"Chinatown\" (1974) and \"Taxi Driver\" (1976) did, by applying creative craftsmanship to raw, adult subject matter; or like the '30s movies \"It Happened One Night,\" \"The Awful Truth,\" and \"Bringing up Baby,\" which undermined the moralistic strictures of the Hays Office with the libertine sophistication of screwball comedy.\n\nInstead, \"Star Wars\" transformed Hollywood economically, by establishing a blockbuster mentality--and especially a mentality based on blockbusters made for teens. It wasn't the first film to do so; \"Jaws,\" released in 1975, was a pioneer. But \"Star Wars\" outdrew \"Jaws,\" and the opportunities to exploit the product commercially were much greater.\n\nSIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter >>", "Browns QB Johnny Manziel Keeps Getting In Trouble For Rapping Future\u2019s \u201cMarch Madness\u201d On Instagram": "Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel, the former Heisman Trophy winner who earned the nickname Johnny Football for his on-field heroics at Texas A&M, has long been intertwined with hip-hop. Most famously, his pal Drake name-dropped him on Lauryn Hill-sampling 2014 loosie \u201cDraft Day.\u201d Unfortunately, Manziel also has a reputation for self-destructive partying, which has made him the subject of plenty scrutiny and sensationalism during his tenure in Cleveland, and Drake\u2019s other pal Future has provided the soundtrack for many of Manziel\u2019s antics.\n\nManziel spent 10 weeks in rehab earlier this year and seemed to be on the same page as his coaching staff. But when the Instagram account @bustedcoverage posted video of Manziel drinking champagne and turning up to Future\u2019s \u201cMarch Madness\u201d during the Browns\u2019 bye week last month, Browns coach Mike Pettine demoted him from first string to third string.\n\nSince then Manziel has regained his starting spot for the typically, comically, biblically woeful Browns. But as Complex points out, yet another video of Manziel drinking while rapping along to \u201cMarch Madness\u201d has emerged. This time Manziel is in a home rather than a club, he\u2019s wearing a Christmas sweater emblazoned with the phrase \u201cMerry Manziel,\u201d 4 Loko is the beverage of choice, and the footage is punctuated with a dab because of course it is.\n\nA Merry Manziel Christmas. A video posted by @bustedcoverage on Dec 27, 2015 at 3:29pm PST\n\nCoach Pettine told ESPN yesterday that he hadn\u2019t seen the video yet but would meet with Manziel to discuss it: \u201cAny time there\u2019s something with our players that casts them potentially in a bad light, whether it\u2019s Johnny or any of our other guys, it\u2019s certainly a concern. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see it and have a discussion with him about it.\u201d Thankfully, ESPN\u2019s reporter got the impression that Manziel won\u2019t be penalized this time, and Pettine made it clear that the QB\u2019s performance during games and practice has been strictly professional.

And while it\u2019s done that \u2014 15 million non-elderly adults have gained coverage \u2014 making that insurance \u201caffordable\u201d remains a significant challenge.\n\nGovernment subsidies for enrollees with incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty level were designed to help with that, but rising premiums and high deductibles mean that getting health care coverage and treatment remains a financial burden for many Americans. A new study from the Urban Institute shows just how high the toll can be.\n\nRelated: Two Big Problems for Obamacare: Cost and Confusion\n\nThe study found that the median single enrollee earning between $35,310 and $47,080, or a family of four earning between $72,750 and $97,000, will spend almost 15 percent of their income next year on Obamacare insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs in 2016, even with federal government subsidies. The percentages increase for those with worsening health and those over age 45. And 10 percent of people in the income range the Urban Institute researchers looked at, between 200 percent and 500 percent of the federal poverty level, will spend more than 21 percent of their income on health care costs.\n\nView photo .\n\nAlthough there\u2019s no objective standard for how much people should spend on health care, \u201ca lot of people make the judgment that it\u2019s unaffordable and that makes a real impact,\u201d says Matthew Buetggens, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute and co-author of the study. A Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that cost is the main reason the uninsured give for why they lack coverage.\n\nThose costs could become a threat to the Obamacare program overall. \u201cThe affordability of marketplace premiums and out-of-pocket limits need to be further addressed to reduce the risk that enrollment and reductions in the number of uninsured will be well below the law\u2019s objectives,\u201d the report reads.\n\nThe health care law created penalties for not signing up, and those fees rose this year and will climb again next year. But once the penalties flatten, if the cost of health care continues growing, more people will face financial pressure to drop out of the exchange, Buetggens says: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a gradual decrease in enrollment, but it\u2019s definitely real.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obamacare Is Now on Life Support\n\nSome progress has been made toward making Obamacare actually affordable, though. The Urban Institute report finds that 17.3 percent of non-elderly adults said they had problems paying their medical bills in 2015, down from 22 percent in 2013.\n\nOf course, steeper health care costs aren\u2019t just limited to those covered by Obamacare \u2014 people with employer-based plans are also going to see larger premiums and out-of-pocket costs next year.\n\nAccording to an analysis from the employee benefits consultancy Aon Hewitt, the combined premium and out-of-pocket costs for employees are going to be more than $5,000 for the first time next year. For workers who make $50,000 or less annually, that means health care costs will account for about 10 percent of their income. But in general, those with employer-based plans, especially for plans offered by large employers, the premiums and out-of-pocket costs are lower than for those with Obamacare.", "Spurs 18-0 at home after 101-95 win over Timberwolves": "Yahoo Sports' Shaun King and Graham Watson look ahead to the Orange Bowl, in which the Sooners and Tigers will meet in a bowl game for the second straight season.\n\nYahoo Sports' Greg Whyshynski answers your social media questions on all things hockey, like where Shea Weber would fit best if traded, who's the leading ROY candidate and what's wrong with Jonathan Toews?\n\nYahoo Sports' Shaun King and Graham Watson look ahead to the Cotton Bowl, which will feature a pair of old colleagues - Spartans head coach Mark Dantonio and Tide head coach Nick Saban - squaring off.\n\n8/25/15: A.J.

''In the first half we played like, so-so, and in the second half much better and we showed we are a team. We showed in bad times that we can be a good team.''\n\nSan Antonio joined the 1978 Portland Trail Blazers and 1986 Houston Rockets as the only Western Conference teams to open a season 18-0 at home.\n\nKawhi Leonard had 17 points and 11 rebounds, but his production was basically a wash as he battled Andrew Wiggins. Minnesota's athletic guard had 18 points and six rebounds.\n\nWith Duncan sitting out due to a sore right knee and LaMarcus Aldridge limited to six points, the Spurs (27-6) needed another big man to step up and Marjanovic did.\n\nHe sparked two key runs, helping San Antonio extend its franchise-record home winning streak to 27 games dating to last season.\n\n''Both stretches he impacted well,'' said Spurs assistant Ettore Messina, who took over for Popovich. ''Not only with his game, that was a quality game, but also because he got the crowd involved, he got his teammates involved.''\n\nMinnesota raced out to an 18-6 lead by distributing the ball before San Antonio's defense could fully set. Every Timberwolves starter had four points in the opening run except for Ricky Rubio, who had two points and five assists.\n\nSan Antonio was listless until Marjanovic sparked a 15-5 spurt bridging the first and second quarters.\n\nThe 290-pound center created a jump ball by standing over Gorgui Dieng with his arms outstretched and waiting for the 6-11 Dieng to jump and put the ball into his hands. Marjanovic won the ensuing jump ball, which led to a 3-pointer by Manu Ginobili.\n\nThe play was one of several by Marjanovic that brought the sellout crowd to its feet.\n\nView gallery SAN ANTONIO, TX - DECEMBER 28: Tony Parker #9 of the San Antonio Spurs shoots the ball against the M \u2026\n\n''Yeah, it's amazing. The fans are amazing,'' Marjanovic said. ''Tonight - every night - but tonight they really gave us support. It was like six players on the court. They helped us a lot.''\n\nMarjanovic had nine points in the third as the Spurs rallied to take a 76-72 lead after trailing by as many as seven points in the quarter. He spun on Dieng on one possession, holding the ball in his right hand as he twirled toward the basket and then tossed in a 2-footer.\n\n''He's just so big,'' Minnesota interim coach Sam Mitchell said. ''I felt like our guys were physical. We boxed out, but he's just so big. I thought we did the best job we could.''\n\nDavid West had 11 points while starting in place of Duncan, and Ginobili added 13 to help the Spurs overcome Popovich's early ejection.\n\nPopovich was thrown out with 1:13 remaining in the first half on two successive technical fouls following a non-call on Aldridge.\n\nOfficial Lauren Holtkamp assessed the first after Popovich was screaming at her as he walked to the baseline in front of the Spurs bench. The initial technical caused Popovich to storm onto the court, where he was restrained under the basket by his assistants as he continued yelling and pointing at Holtkamp.\n\nView gallery SAN ANTONIO, TX - DECEMBER 28: Tim Duncan #21 of the San Antonio Spurs and Kyle Anderson #1 of the S \u2026\n\nThe tirade led James Capers to call a second technical and eject Popovich.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nTimberwolves: Minnesota is 3-12 after starting the season 8-8.

He was 83.\n\n''Obviously, we all watched him for a lot of years,'' Popovich said. ''Growing up, the Globetrotters were something special and he was like the iconic figure of that whole group. So, it's a sad day.''\n\nSTAND IN\n\nMessina was unsure how to handle the media following the victory. The Spurs' assistant took over when Popovich was ejected late in the first half and also had to fill in for the longtime San Antonio coach after the game.\n\n''I don't know how to do this thing here,'' Messina said. ''I talk?

''We have that when we play the best teams and sometimes we don't against the lesser teams.''\n\nRose has averaged 21.3 points as the Bulls have won two of three games - beating the Thunder and Raptors - following a three-game skid which included losses to the Knicks and Nets.\n\nThe common thread to Friday's 105-96 win in Oklahoma City and Monday's 104-97 victory over Toronto was good defense, holding those teams to a combined 40.8 percent shooting.

He totaled 59 points while making 8 of 15 from 3-point range, but the former All-Star enters this matchup stuck in his worst stretch of the season.\n\nGeorge is averaging 11.5 points in his last four games while shooting 25.4 percent.

Davis said Tuesday he's no more concerned about his job security than usual. He said he's focused on getting his defense back to where it was earlier this season.\n\n''The only way to stop the conversation about job security is to win more games,'' he said.\n\nHere's where Davis' defense has ranked during his last three seasons under Chip Kelly:\n\n- 2013: 29th overall (394 yards per game), 32nd against the pass (289.8 yards), 10th against the run (104.2 yards) and tied for 17th in points allowed (23.9).\n\n- 2014: 28th overall (375.6 yards), 31st against the pass (264.9 yards), 15th against the run (110.7 yards) and 23rd in points allowed (25.0).\n\n- 2015, with one game to go: 30th overall (394.9 yards), 26th against the pass (265.3) and 29th against the run (129.7) and 28th in points allowed (26.7).\n\nThe Eagles managed to win 10 games each of those first two seasons because of a potent offense. This year, the offense hasn't carried the team.\n\nChanges to the secondary and linebackers last offseason gave the defense hope and a spark. Through the first nine games, the Eagles ranked in the top 10 in several defensive categories.\n\n''I have to figure out why and when and how and then how we're going to fix it and how we're going to make sure it doesn't happen next year,'' Davis said. ''Because we've shown we're capable of playing top defense. ... We didn't maintain it through the season. That's disappointing.''\n\nDavis said most of the problems stem from inconsistency.\n\n''Consistency in tackling, scheming it so the guys are in position to make plays and then getting out of the way to let them make plays,'' he said.

At least if you believe in conspiracy theories involving the New England coach, something many NFL fans do.\n\n''I thought it was the best thing to do,'' Belichick said of forgoing receiving the football.\n\nSure, Pats special teams captain Matt Slater might have bungled the strategy. Belichick instructed him to choose to defend the north end zone if New England won the coin toss. New York would almost certainly then choose to receive the kickoff. But after Slater won by calling heads, the first words out of his mouth were, ''We want to kick.''\n\nBefore he could even add ''that way'' as he pointed to the south end zone, referee Clete Blakeman turned and asked the Jets captains which direction they wanted to go.\n\nSo, the Jets got the ball and the bearing, and they scored quickly on Eric Decker's TD grab to win 26-20 and boost their playoff hopes while depriving the Patriots of clinching the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\n\nView gallery The officials meet New York Jets' Darrelle Revis (24), teammate Calvin Pryor (25) and New Englan \u2026\n\nNow, the Patriots cannot rest their regulars at Miami next weekend.\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing.

They need to beat the Browns and for Buffalo to beat the Jets next weekend, or for Denver to lose its last two games, beginning with Cincinnati - which hasn't won a Monday night road game since 1990.\n\nView gallery Arizona Cardinals defensive back D.J.

But a slip-up next week and they might end up hitting the road in the playoffs, maybe making a return trip to Denver, where they've lost two in a row.\n\nThey dropped the conference championship in 2014 to Peyton Manning and fell in a 30-24 overtime game in November to Brock Osweiler.\n\nIf things line up right and Manning returns from his left foot injury next month, there could still be 17th matchup between Brady and Manning, either in Massachusetts or Colorado, after their scheduled faceoff was scuttled last month.\n\nSpeaking of Manning, Al Jazeera's investigative report Sunday in which a former intern at an anti-aging clinic claimed the quarterback obtained HGH in 2011 through shipments to his wife, Ashley, drew a furious denial from Manning.

The Packers brought in the hard-hitting safety and two-year starter in Houston for a physical last month, but flunked him because of a turf toe, so he went to Arizona a week later.\n\nAnd of course there was Kirk Cousins' brain freeze Saturday night when he took a knee at the Eagles 6 instead of throwing the ball or spiking it with no timeouts and 6 seconds left in the first half of Washington's 38-24 win at Philadelphia.\n\n''We were going to throw a fade to Pierre Garcon, complete or incomplete,'' a befuddled Redskins coach Jay Gruden said moments later.

(AP) -- There was a time early in Kyle Busch's career that his talent could not save his job.\n\nWrecked race cars and temper tantrums helped wear out his welcome with Rick Hendrick, who let Busch go knowing the young driver would probably beat Hendrick Motorsports in a championship battle down the road.\n\nThat's exactly what happened, too, as Busch finally won his first Sprint Cup title on Sunday. He won the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway to lock up the crown and deny former Hendrick teammate Jeff Gordon a fifth title in the final race of his career.\n\nThe title-winning drive also dethroned reigning champion Kevin Harvick and stopped Martin Truex Jr. from winning his first Cup title in a four-man race to the trophy. It came in the most turbulent season of Busch's career, and showed just how much he's matured since Hendrick let him go eight years ago.\n\nBusch was in a horrible accident in February when he crashed into a concrete wall at Daytona and broke his right leg and left foot. It happened the day before the Daytona 500 and put both his season and his career in jeopardy.\n\nBut he worked harder than he's ever worked in his life at anything to recover, and he was back in the race car a mere three months later. NASCAR gave him a waiver to race in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship should he qualify, and Busch made it his mission to earn one of the coveted playoff positions.\n\nView gallery Kyle Busch celebrates after winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series auto race and the season title Sund \u2026\n\nIn the days after his return to racing, Busch turned 30 and celebrated the birth of his son. During the 11 races he missed, he'd spent time with his wife and developed a perspective on life that he'd never had before. His rivals saw the difference in him on the track.\n\n''I see a changed Kyle,'' Gordon said. ''When he came back, not only was he driven and just inspired by it, but you can tell he was racing smarter, with more patience, just being more deliberate. Between having a baby, the thing that happened to him at Daytona, the time with his wife ... he had a lot of time to think about a lot of things, and I don't know what he did, but he came out of it even better than he was before.\n\n''I think he showed it right away when he came back that there was a pretty good chance he was destined to win this championship.''\n\nIndeed, Busch won in his sixth race back, on the road course at Sonoma, a week after he finished last at Michigan. He crashed two cars in his first five races back as he pushed too hard to try to earn a spot in the Chase.\n\nIt was after that last-place finish at Michigan that he recognized he had to be a more patient driver if he had any shot at all at making the playoffs.\n\nView gallery Kyle Busch raises his trophy after winning the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series auto race and the season tit \u2026\n\n''When we went and finished 43rd at Michigan, that's when I was just like, 'All right, forget it. Just race the race car. Don't worry about running up front and winning and being fast. Just let it come to you,''' Busch said. ''And I played the whole rest of the season that way all the way to the end - just let everything be. Whatever it was going to be, it was going to be.''\n\nBusch was never capable of thinking like that during the early part of his career and it hurt him down the stretch every season.\n\nWhen Hendrick let him go, he moved to Joe Gibbs Racing and drove hell-bent on making Hendrick regret his decision. Busch won eight races that year, but faltered down the stretch and finished 10th in the 2008 Chase.\n\nThere were four wins the next year, but a 13th-place finish in the final standings. A three-win season in 2010 still only got him to eighth in points, and on and on the cycle went as Busch just couldn't race smart or safe enough in the Chase.\n\nBefore Sunday's season finale, he'd never even won a race in the Chase and he'd never remained in title contention down the final stretch.\n\nView gallery Kyle Busch kisses his wife, Samantha, with their son, Brexton, with them, after winning the NASCAR S \u2026\n\nBut after winning at Sonoma, he recognized his new strategy might be the right one and Busch reeled off four wins in five weeks. He earned his spot in the Chase and then raced fairly error-free to make it into the final four.\n\nBusch didn't relentlessly chase victories in this year's Chase; he just tried to be steady to put himself in a position to race for the title.\n\nHarvick, who overcame his own self-inflicted issues to win his first title a year ago, lauded the improvements in Busch. It's high praise coming from Harvick, who has sparred with Busch repeatedly throughout his career.\n\nHarvick mellowed after he had a child, and he thinks the birth of Busch's son six months ago played a huge role in him winning a championship.\n\n''I think you see that little guy that he holds in his arms, it puts things in a different perspective,'' he said. ''It used to be you didn't want to have kids because it took the fire out of you from driving the car, and now it seems to have calmed a lot of us down to the point where we can focus and do the things that we need to do to concentrate on our jobs. He's overcome a lot, but man, he's still pretty young.''", "'You Like That' more than playful rallying cry for Kirk Cousins": "PHILADELPHIA \u2013 He wasn't the all-time bet in 2012. He wasn't the one the Washington Redskins dropped the mortgage on, wagered the savings, risked the college fund and the marriage. In a league historically littered with all-in, franchise-savior quarterbacks, Kirk Cousins was always billed as something less: A hedge, an argument, a long-odds backup plan.\n\nUntil now. Until Saturday. Until he became the winning ticket \u2013 for himself and the franchise he leads.\n\nKirk Cousins paid off. The Washington Redskins are in the postseason after Saturday's win against the Philadelphia Eagles, and at the age of 27, Cousins is headed toward an offseason in which his franchise will sign him to a new contract that will measure tens of millions in guaranteed money. Once a captive caretaker expected to do little more than bridge the injury pauses between Robert Griffin III's glories, Cousins has survived. He outlasted Griffin's two-year cratering. He outgrew his own shortcomings. And finally, he helped the Redskins outperform a pitiful NFC East. View gallery . Kirk Cousins and the Redskins are headed to the playoffs as NFC East champs. (AP)\n\nAs Cousins walked through a corridor Saturday night, departing his news conference, he loudly and pointedly asked a Redskins staffer, \"How many of them picked us to win the division?\" The \"them\" Cousins referred to was a flock of media members, many of whom had eagerly asked him about his rise as a starter and how far the streaking Redskins could go. But Cousins' words were more of a rhetorical remark than anything. And the moment was defiant, an underappreciated quarterback looking for someone to tell him, \"Nobody, Kirk. Nobody picked this team to win the NFC East. Nobody picked you.\"\n\nThis was a more understated version of his galvanizing \"YOU LIKE THAT!\" moment earlier in the season. But for good measure, Cousins repeated that line, too. First in a chant with a throng of Redskins fans who made the always-dicey trek into Philadelphia for the division clincher. Then Cousins screamed it again at team president Bruce Allen as he walked into the locker room. Allen responded by throwing an arm around his quarterback for a celebratory embrace, then shoved him in the chest the way a proud brother affectionately pushes his sibling.\n\nThere's something telling about that whole phrase. It's more than a T-shirt for Cousins. It's more than a rallying cry. Indeed, it's very much a quarterback demanding to be appreciated, demanding to be respected. In the past, when Griffin was still the centerpiece of the franchise, anything Cousins did was considered ancillary. His pluses were an appetizer for a future trade or the extra frosting of having a talented backup. And that lingered, even into this season's training camp, when the divide between team owner Dan Snyder's loyalties to Griffin and head coach Jay Gruden's designs for Cousins were still being sorted out.\n\nIt was Griffin who lined up fans who continued to protest that he could do no wrong, that RG3 had to be who he was and ball out. When national media visited, Griffin was the man pursued. Meanwhile, Cousins and Gruden bided their time. If Griffin didn't work out, the plan was in place for the coach to seize the situation and install the player who had seemed most aligned with his coaching expectations since the day he arrived. And in what seemed inevitable, Griffin never got going in the preseason, leaving the door open for what Gruden wanted: A chance to insert Cousins and declare him as the starter for the entire 2015 season.\n\nThis was Cousins' shot. And after a 2-4 start composed of up-and-down performances, he brought the Redskins back in a thrilling 31-30 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Oct. 25. This was the corner, and unbeknownst to most looking at Washington, Cousins had turned it. Counting that day, Cousins is 6-3. He's scored a total of 24 touchdowns in that span and thrown only three interceptions, and had six passing performances over 300 yards.\n\nThe win on Saturday served as a prime example of what can be. When the line is protecting Cousins, when he is given time to throw, he is finding mismatches. He is firing accurately downfield. He is making smart decisions. And he's racking up pinball stats against bad teams and defenses. That is fine because ascending from capable starter to even a modest star at that position requires showing an ability to beat bad defenses. Cousins is doing that. When healthy, pieces like tight end Jordan Reed and wideouts DeSean Jackson, Pierre Garcon and Jamison Crowder have been effective in all three levels of the passing tree.\n\nThis is the kind of development envisioned by Gruden, who fought for Cousins' right to lead the team and believed that with each opportunity to fail or succeed, he would pay back such faith. And when one of those failures came at the end of the half against the Eagles \u2013 with Cousins incomprehensibly kneeling away a field-goal opportunity rather than spiking the ball and stopping the clock \u2013 Gruden did little more than shrug at the mistake.\n\nView gallery . Jay Gruden picked Kirk Cousins over Robert Griffin III this summer. (Getty Images)\n\nBut Gruden knows there is more to do. Cousins knows. The roster knows. They've been here before, entering the playoffs and feeling like they've got the quarterback who can make all the difference in the coming years. Certainly, Washington will pay Cousins this offseason as if that is the case. But the last time that happened, everything came apart in two long, excruciating years. But Cousins also has unique perspective. He lived it. He was part of it. He learned from it. And maybe that's enough to make this different.\n\n\"[This is] very satisfying,\" Cousins said. \"This is the most satisfied I've been as a football player. It's a big accomplishment. Now the key is to build from here. \u2026 This is our first year. I feel like our offense has grown as the year has gone on. We've kind of figured things out as we went. I keep saying it, 'People forget I was named the starter a week before the season.' It wasn't like we had the chance to build this offense around me back in April.\"\n\nNo, Cousins didn't get that opportunity. It went to the more acclaimed, more heavily wagered upon teammate. But maybe not being that guy, the one tied forever to a sink-or-fly draft gamble, is worth something, too. Maybe it afforded Cousins time to see everything that was wrong with his team and his locker room and his own game, but not be constantly held accountable for those cracks. Maybe it gives time to figure some things out.\n\nAt the very least, Cousins has shown being billed as something less and delivering as something more can pay far more than imagined. For the Redskins and their quarterback, that's the story of this season.", "The new password: emojis?": "Researchers claim their method is 98% hack-proof\n\nEmojipedia Let me just select the hot dog and the ping-pong paddle, and then I can plan for my retirement. D MA MB MC MD ME MG ZF ZG ZQ ZR ZS ZT ZU\n\nResearchers have come up with a new password system that involves little pictures and patterns instead of characters.\n\nThe system, called GOTPass, was developed by researchers at Plymouth University in the U.K. It would require users to draw a shape instead of entering a password, similar to how iPhone and Android users can already opt to draw a letter or shape with their finger instead of enter a string of letters and numbers to unlock phones.\n\nThen, a user must identify the two images or emojis they previously selected from 16 options. If the user picks the correct images, he or she is given a one-time passcode to access the account. Each time a user logs into the account, he or she must go through the process to receive a new one-time code.\n\nThe researchers, whose work was published in the Information Security Journal: A Global Perspective, say their system could be applicable for online banking or any other services that typically seek multiple forms of authentication.\n\nThe researchers claim their method is 98% hack-proof, according to their own security tests. (Of the 690 attempted hackings, only eight were \u201cgenuinely successful,\u201d with 15 successes attributed to \u201ccoincidence.\u201d)\n\nThe research comes at a time when the industry has already moved toward a commitment to kill off traditional passwords, given that they\u2019ve been widely deemed ineffective as a form of security. Verizon found in 2014 that two of every three data breaches involved the exploitation of weak or stolen passwords. Some academics have proposed that the government ban the use of passwords altogether.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that emojis are becoming an option for passwords. Their use is so prevalent that in May, Domino\u2019s Pizza introduced a way for people to order a pizza by tweeting a pizza emoji. MarketWatch outlined a financial emoji guide so our readers could use emojis to talk markets. And Kim Kardashian introduced the \u201cKimoji\u201d app, which features little pictures of herself, a doughnut and her famous booty.\n\nAnd the Plymouth University researchers aren\u2019t the first to suggest emojis replace the password. A U.K.-based online banking platform provider introduced emoji-only passcodes earlier this year, allowing users to choose four emojis from 44 images to log in. Intelligent Environments said then that emoji passcodes would \u201cprevent hackers from identifying common and easily obtainable numerical passcodes, like a date of birth or a wedding anniversary.\u201d\n\nPriya Anand is MarketWatch's consumer fraud reporter.

The Texas senator has impressed her with his unwavering toughness on national security issues, especially his support for Israel, the issue that the couple cares most passionately about.\n\n\u201cHe really likes Marco, but she really likes Cruz \u2014 and it\u2019s a standoff,\u201d said one well-placed Republican fundraiser familiar with Adelson family dynamics.\n\nIt\u2019s a standoff that could result in an awkward split decision \u2014 or no decision at all, according to some GOP insiders. Both the Adelsons give generously in their own names, almost always in tandem: The couple\u2019s publicly reported donations exceeded $98 million during the 2012 election. Miriam Adelson wrote nearly half those checks personally, totaling more than $47 million, usually delivering them on the same day her husband wrote seven-figure checks for about the same amount.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio walks offstage after speaking at a community rally. (Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nBut one prediction that is gaining traction in GOP circles is that the Adelsons may end up sitting out the early GOP primaries altogether, rather than choose sides and risk funding attack ads against a candidate one of them actually favors. Some say they could even go their separate ways, at least in the early stages of the contest. \u201cShe\u2019s very capable of doing whatever she wants,\u201d said one GOP insider in regular touch with the Adelsons. \u201cIf she wants to support Cruz, there\u2019s nothing stopping her.\u201d (Spokesmen for Adelson and for Cruz did not respond to requests for comment. Rubio spokesman Alex Conant emailed: \u201cI don\u2019t comment on the Adelsons.\u201d)\n\nThe Adelsons\u2019 dilemma comes at a critical juncture in the GOP race. Rubio and Cruz are openly sniping at each other over national security issues as they vie to become the \u201cresponsible\u201d conservative alternative to frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\nIn recent days, a super-PAC allied with Rubio has begun running attack ads blasting Cruz for allegedly voting to \u201cweaken America\u2019s ability to identify and hunt down terrorists\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Texas senator\u2019s support for legislation that this week ended bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records by the NSA. Cruz shot back that the pro-Rubio ad was \u201cimpugning\u201d his patriotism, while his campaign released its own attack ads in Iowa criticizing Rubio for his past support for the so-called Gang of Eight immigration reform bill that would have given Obama authority \u201cto admit even more Syrian refugees.\u201d (Rubio has since backed away from his support for the bill.)\n\nRead More", "Week 16: Deep Sleepers and DFS Bargains": "It\u2019s a Super Bowl edition of Deep Sleepers and DFS Bargains.

Since returning from bye in Week 12, QB Ben Roethlisberger has completed the most passes (130) for the most yards (1,482). In that time, Wheaton has emerged as a legitimate weapon in the passing game. Garnering double-digit targets in two of his last four games and scoring in three of his past four contests, the third-year speedster has cracked the top 25 fantasy wideouts in three of his last four outings.\n\nIn Week 16 the white hot Steelers will travel to Baltimore to take on a beleaguered Ravens squad that has surrendered nine scores to opposing receivers since Week 12. Allowing the most fantasy points to the WR position, the Ravens are a phenomenally friendly matchup for the Burgh\u2019s trio of playmakers. Owned in just 35 percent of Yahoo leagues and $20 cheaper than Antonio Brown in DFS, Wheaton is the most accessible piece of a must-own offense.\n\nCameron Artis-Payne, RB, Carolina Panthers ($16)\n\nWith Jonathan Stewart nursing a sprained foot, Artis-Payne led the Panthers backfield in Week 15. The rookie averaged 4.2 YPC against a soft Giants run defense, racking up 93 combined yards on 16 total touches. Despite not starting, Artis-Payne was on the field for 40 percent of the snaps, which was more than either Mike Tolbert or Fozzy Whitaker. A tough runner without much wiggle, it was encouraging to see the Auburn product successfully used as a receiver, as he caught both of the balls Cam threw his way.\n\nThis Sunday the Panthers will attempt to earn their fifteenth win of the season at the Georgia Dome. The Falcons have surrendered an average of nearly 127 rushing yards per game, over their last three games. When in Carolina two weeks ago, they allowed both Stewart and Whittaker into the end zone. Relinquishing the fourth most fantasy points to opposing running backs, Atlanta is a plus matchup for the underpriced rookie.\n\n[Week 16 rankings: Quarterback | Running Back | Receiver | Tight End | Flex | All Positions]\n\nRashad Jennings, RB, New York Giants ($14)\n\nIt only took three quarters of the season, but the Giants finally chose a lead back and gave him the ball more than 15 times. The lucky beneficiary of those aforementioned totes was Jennings, who existed as a fantasy starter (Week 14 = RB19 and Week 15 = RB6) in back-to-back weeks. Racking up at least 100 yards in both Weeks 14 and 15, Jennings has an opportunity to produce against Minnesota on Sunday night.\n\nThe Vikings had been tough against the run for the bulk of the season, but various key injuries have prevented them from stuffing opposing backs as of late. Allowing 100+ yard outings to lead RBs for five consecutive weeks, backs opposing Minnesota since Week 11 have finished at least among the top 18 players at the position. Jennings is likely to see numerous stacked boxes with Odell Beckham Jr. out of the lineup, but should also be heavily leaned upon.\n\nBONUS:\n\nKarlos Williams, RB, Buffalo Bills ($18)\n\nWith LeSean McCoy yet to practice this week, it looks as though Williams will carry the rock for Buffalo. Scoring 7 TDs in nine weeks of play, the rookie\u2019s end zone appeal is obvious. He has recently been limited by a shoulder injury, and Mike Gillislee has picked up the slack, but Williams is a more proven commodity who could be a low-end RB2 in Week 16.\n\n[Don\u2019t miss Yahoo\u2019s NBA free roll on Christmas.

And, yes, the Pats did add Steven Jackson earlier in the week. However, White\u2019s involvement in the passing game cannot be denied. Second in team looks for three consecutive weeks, White has reeled in 21 balls and 2 scores via the air since Week 13. With both Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman banged up, White should continue to be heavily targeted. The Jets are stingy against the run, but can be beat underneath, which is where White should make hay.\n\nJaelen Strong, WR, Houston Texans ($10)\n\nStepping up in the stead of Cecil Shorts last Sunday, Strong scored the Texans\u2019 lone touchdown. The rookie receiver has only caught six balls in 2015, but three of them have been in the end zone. With Shorts expected to sit again in Week 16 and 32-year-old Nate Washington struggling, Strong could make a statement against the Titans who have surrendered six scores to wideouts over their last three contests.\n\nFollow Liz on Twitter @LizLoza_FF", "CFA Institute \u2014 The Benefits and Risks of Target Date Funds (TDFs)": "By Salil Mehta, CFA\n\n\n\nWhat is the optimal amount of risk a client should have in their portfolio throughout their career?\n\nThis is not an easy question to answer, so it is not surprising that there are many different responses. Target date funds (TDFs) are, in theory, simple products that allow clients to focus on a single question: \u201cHow old am I?\u201d\n\nThis data then roughly maps to their retirement age (e.g., a 40 year old has 25\u201330 years of career remaining), and the TDF automatically allocates risk to the fund along a predefined allocation mix appropriate for someone as they evolve toward retirement.\n\nFor example, most people generally appreciate that they want to take on less risk closer to retirement than during their younger days.\n\nBut the Funds Often Disagree with Themselves\n\nIn practice, an investor using an TDF is somewhat removed from having to think about and make short-term tactical decisions. TDFs automatically reallocate funds back to the predefined risk levels, which is helpful during extreme market moves.\n\nThis rebalance occurs only quarterly, however, which is not optimal. Extreme repricings of risk tend to last only weeks or months.\n\nThe key to a passive portfolio construction is to have a solid framework for what the overall most appropriate risk allocation should be.\n\nWe see from research, in addition to the mathematical idea that during retirement one places a higher utility on risk, that the function can be somewhat analogous to this estimated probabilistic expression:\n\nRisk allocation * \u221a(adjusted-time remaining)\n\nWhere adjusted-time is equal to years to retirement plus one half the years expected to live in retirement.\n\nSo someone 90% invested in risk at age 25 (with an expected retirement at 65 and total retirement of 18 years), would at age 65 show the following risk allocation level:\n\n90% * \u221a[(18/2)/(40+18/2)]\n\n~ 90% * \u221a[(9)/(49)]\n\n~ 90% * 43%\n\n~ 39% risk allocation\n\nThis optimal risk allocation, based upon the investor\u2019s longevity and modeling uncertainty, provides for an allocation similar to what TDFs currently have. With (domestic) equities the largest risky asset in TDFs, one can see this concave-shaped result in the chart below.\n\nInvestments in cash and bonds mostly complement this.\n\nThe actual optimal path has a confidence interval around it, though what is most instructive here for our focus is on the general shape and location.\n\nFor example, we note that T. Rowe Price and the government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) both under-allocate to equities (perhaps by 10% allocation) in one\u2019s early wealth building years.\n\nFidelity and Vanguard continue to over-allocate to equities (by as much as 10%\u201315% allocation) as one is preparing to head into retirement.\n\nVanguard only gradually glides their risk down linearly, and it doesn\u2019t accelerate their risk reduction in the concave shape that we show is optimal.\n\nThat TDFs differ from one another in so many ways,suggests that there is no single variable assumption among them. Instead it is a mystery. For example, the difference among the TDFs is not as simple as one thing \u2014 say, the longevity risk assumption.\n\nSo this leaves a greater onus on investors to think carefully about the TDF that they select, since they are not just identical products with slightly different fees.\n\nSo What Do You Do?\n\nFirst, it is imperative for retirees to think about their end of life first. They might live longer than expected, and this is one risk we cannot diversify away.\n\nKnow also that they may not be financially employable or productive throughout the years until their expected retirement age. And while difficult, this assumption implies the need for an even greater savings cushion in retirement.\n\nThere are research and resources available for older Americans who may find themselves with diminished financial reasoning skills later in life. They should safeguardmuch of their allocation trajectory as soon as they are capable. As uncomfortable as it may be, it is better they confront their thoughts on your mortality now, and then plot their optimal risk path.\n\nIt is critical to remember that no one will be able to perfectly identify a specific and unwavering optimal risk path. And our unique situations are so complicated and different from one another that no one model will get it right for everyone.\n\nThe error and confidence interval around such estimates is high, so it is most critical to think about the optimal risk path only in terms of its general location and shape.\n\nThe reason for this uncertainty is that market and macroeconomic growth in any region is subject to considerable model and long-term growth forecast uncertainty, which impacts the abilities of wise central planners. In life we have to assume a middle path and consider TDFs in more retirement-oriented accounts (less subject to income cash-flow changes).\n\nEven TDFs are not cemented in their philosophical views. The risky asset allocation away from bonds can be modified by the fund company too, as we currently see with the government\u2019s TSP shortly after my article here.\n\nIf you liked this post, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to the Enterprising Investor.\n\nAll posts are the opinion of the author.

This was, ostensibly, because Greer felt he has been underused at BU probably both this year and last. And indeed, in the 2014-15 season, you probably would have been able to argue against his broader use, because he was one of the youngest players in college hockey \u2014 being 17 years old for a decent chunk of the season \u2014 playing against grown men. He got into almost every game, but he didn't get much of a run-out because the Terriers were deep up front.\n\nThis year, they are not as deep, but nonetheless played what you'd have to call a supporting role, and was further passed over by a number of freshmen for higher-profile jobs. The relationship apparently wasn't working for Greer, who has yet to play a game for Rouyn-Noranda, so his college career came to an end with a line of 4-8-12 in 55 games.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, A.J. felt that jumping to the QMJHL would be better for his development,\u201d BU coach David Quinn told the Boston Globe. \u201cAfter we finished up the first semester last week, I let Colorado know that it wasn\u2019t working with A.J. because he couldn\u2019t accept his role and that he had to change if he was going to come back for the second semester.\u201d\n\nThat quote sounds a little more ominous than it perhaps ought to \u2014 Quinn further added it was an \u201camicable\u201d split \u2014 but nonetheless that's another forward BU can't use this year.\n\nAnd that's especially worrisome (not to mention curious) because of the big reason for people to be concerned about the Terriers going forward: The likely long-term injury to undrafted junior forward Ahti Oksanen.\n\nOksanen went into the boards in the Terriers' final game of the first half, at Quinnipiac, in one of those classic scary hits where you immediately know something bad has happened. The Terriers are calling it an upper-body injury but reports indicate it's a shoulder injury, and possibly a pretty bad one. If Oksanen is out for any serious period of time \u2014 and with the team bringing in a 20-year-old NAHL player for the second half, it seems like a distinct possibility \u2014 that's a major blow to the Terriers.\n\nThere is one thing Oksanen does extremely well: Shoot the puck. His release is high-level pro-quality, and his willingness to use it is unparalleled both on his team and in college hockey. He takes about 5.17 shots per game to lead the nation, and the next-closest guy on the team takes two fewer. He also leads BU in goals with nine, but that came after a stretch in which he didn't score at all on his first 25 or so shots of the year. In his last 13 games, he's 9-5-14, but more importantly had those nine goals on 70(!) shots.\n\nView photo .\n\nThere is, simply put, no way to replace that either with a single player or by committee. However, if Oksanen is out for an extended period, the Greer move is a bit odd because, hey, a top-line forward spot just opened up and that means everyone moves a step up the ladder. At least in theory.\n\nBut regardless, that means BU is down two forwards who were regular features in the lineup, one of whom was a major contributor and replaced them with just one who is very much an unknown quantity, to say the least.\n\nThe reason that's so impactful is that this is a team getting by on rather thin margins. The Terriers are 9-6-3 this season and have scored only eight more goals than their opponents. They've taken an extra 113 shots, 93(!!!) of which are off the stick of Oksanen alone. Again, this is in only 18 games. Losing a volume shooter like Oksanen therefore narrows the margins for success considerably, especially given that this is a team which trails rather more often than it would probably like (for about 40 percent of all its minutes). Without a shooter like Oksanen, it becomes harder to close those gaps.\n\nAnd without someone like Greer who ostensibly has the skill to step into that role and reasonably replace at least a decent chunk of those shots with better linemates and more minutes \u2014 please note that college hockey doesn't publish or even officially compile TOI data, so I can't give you shots per 60, only per game, which obviously skews in favor of guys who get more ice time \u2014 that makes things more difficult.\n\nWhile there has been some speculation that Oksanen could be back for the first games after break, other reports on his impending absence range from \u201ca month\u201d to \u201cfor the season.\u201d If either of the latter timeframes end up being the case, BU is going to be in tough to pick up a lot of Ws, because it has games coming up against high-level teams like Harvard and BC in the next three weeks alone. If you're looking at a two-month period, that could also include dates with UMass Lowell.\n\nIn any case, the longer Oksanen is out, the worse off the Terriers are going to be, and potentially by a considerable margin. While it's entirely possible that the team successfully changes its approach, or that someone steps up and gets the bounces to go their way for a while (entirely possible with this many talented players on the team), this is likely a crippling loss for the Terriers.\n\nAnd it's just heaping the misery on a team that's had plenty of it lately.\n\nA somewhat arbitrary ranking of teams which are pretty good in my opinion only (and just for right now but maybe for a little longer too?)\n\n1.

We know we right our own ship,'' said cornerback Captain Munnerlyn, who picked off Manning's pass midway through the third quarter to set up Peterson's score that made it 29-3.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater turned in another sharp December performance, Blair Walsh chipped in five field goals and the Vikings (10-5) set up an NFC North championship game next week at Green Bay. That game, like this one, was moved to the Sunday night slot.\n\n''I think we're playing with confidence right now. I think our guys feel good about the things that we're doing, and I think they believe,'' Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. ''Half the battle is believing.''\n\nWith Peterson trying to stay warm on the sideline, Jerick McKinnon rushed for two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including a 68-yard romp through a disinterested defense with the temperature down to 11 degrees.\n\nManning badly missed suspended wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and his 1,396 yards and 13 touchdowns, as the Giants (6-9) trudged toward a fourth straight absence from the postseason. Manning dismissed the notion that Beckham's suspension hung over the team this week.\n\n''We just didn't play well,'' Manning said, ''and they did.''\n\nWashington's win over Philadelphia on Saturday night ended the NFC East race, rendering the outcome meaningless for the Giants.

Not a separated left shoulder, a bum left elbow or an infected left eye.\n\nNot even two-touchdown deficits.\n\nThe comeback Osweiler engineered against Cincinnati on Monday night established the Denver Broncos as the only team in NFL history ever to overcome 14-point deficits in one season against three playoff-bound teams.\n\nTwo of those came on his watch.\n\nHe guided Denver back from a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit against New England last month and helped the Broncos (11-4) clinch a playoff spot Monday night after falling behind 14-0 and watching Brandon McManus shank a potential game-winning field goal at the end of regulation.\n\nView gallery Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton and Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning talk prior \u2026\n\nOsweiler shook off that disappointment just like he keeps brushing off questions about his week-to-week starting status and drove Denver to the go-ahead field goal in overtime before DeMarcus Ware's fumble recovery sealed it.\n\n''I've said all along that it's part of growing up,'' coach Gary Kubiak said. ''If you're going to be a good player in this league, you have to block out noise. He's done a great job of that. I think the team has done a great job of that and rallied behind him. So he just continues, to me, to get better. He's a good decision-maker right now.''\n\nOsweiler has a simple solution to dealing with all the noise.\n\n''I don't hear it,'' he said.

A coach once told me - no offense to anybody - 'Close your ears to all of that and focus on your job.'''\n\nOsweiler is 4-2 as Denver's starter and those two losses, against Oakland and Pittsburgh, easily could have been wins were it not for big drops by tight end Vernon Davis and wide receiver Demaryius Thomas.\n\nView gallery Denver Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler (17) leaves the field after an NFL football game against t \u2026\n\nOsweiler shrugged off McManus' missed field goal just as he's miniaturized every other obstacle that's come his way since taking over at quarterback on Nov. 15. He calmly led the Broncos 61 yards in 13 plays for McManus' redemptive field goal.\n\n''In football, you don't have time to blink,'' Osweiler said. ''You don't have time to think about the previous play. In a given football game, there are going to be good plays, there are going to be bad plays. There are going to be touchdowns. Hopefully there's not too many turnovers. But that's football.''\n\nOsweiler uses that same focus when asked whether he deserves to be the starter in the playoffs.\n\nHe said all he's concerned with is beating the Chargers at home on Sunday to secure a first-round bye and maybe even the top overall seed if New England loses at Miami. That's something that would ostensibly help Manning in his bid to return to the field this season and send Osweiler back to the sideline.\n\n''I'm not concerned with the quarterback situation,'' Osweiler said. ''I'm going to show up whether I'm the starter or whether I'm the backup. I'm going to prepare the same exact way. I'm going to be the same exact guy in that building regardless of the situation.''\n\nView gallery Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning and his son, Marshall Manning, greet Cincinnati Bengals he \u2026\n\nKubiak said he's seen growth in Osweiler's input since becoming the starter.

So, that's where I really see the growth and that's his confidence in what we're doing.''\n\nKubiak has already named Osweiler the starter against the Chargers. Manning could return to practice Wednesday night for the first time since Dec. 17. He's practiced just twice with his teammates in the last 45 days.\n\nManning issued an angry denial over the weekend regarding Al Jazeera's report that he obtained HGH in 2011 through shipments to his wife.\n\nKubiak said he was confident Manning could compartmentalize his emotions and focus on football.\n\n''Oh yeah, absolutely.

At QB, it's cream or stream\n\n\n\n\"Cream or stream\" is a pithy way of saying that if you don't take one of the very elite fantasy QBs in your draft next season, you may want to consider waiting to near the bitter end of your draft to take a signal caller.\n\nWe saw in 2015 how fungible the middle class at fantasy QB has become. It used to be that if you didn't land an elite QB, there were still rock solid next-tier options (Matt Ryan, Tony Romo, Philip Rivers, Matthew Stafford, Eli Manning, et al) to turn to that were still preferable to the abyss that was the bottom half of the NFL's crop of starting QBs. But in 2015, you were better off streaming a Tyrod Taylor, Ryan Fitzpatrick, Kirk Cousins, Derek Carr and (if the matchup was particularly juicy) even a Josh McCown or Brian Hoyer than standing firm with some supposed next-tier option like those I already mentioned. Heck, even Drew Brees (especially on the road) and Aaron Rodgers dropped out of the can't-bench class.\n\nThe proliferation of the pass in the NFL has pushed more QBs on to the fantasy radar. Heading into Week 16, there were 18 teams averaging at least 17 fantasy points per game (Yahoo default scoring) at the QB position. The previous high water mark was 12 (in 2012). There were 11 in each of the past two seasons. So the NFL's passing plate has never been heaped so high with fantasy goodness. Use the situation to your advantage next August by either drafting one of the few remaining true difference-makers at the position, or happily streaming from the burgeoning middle class.\n\n2. Round 1 Running Back - good luck with that\n\n\n\nI don't know about you, but I'm all in on taking a receiver early in the first round of next year's fantasy draft. Maybe you arrived at this conclusion long ago, but certainly the consensus has remained true to the Round 1 RB strategy. Sure, some receivers (like Antonio Brown) were prevalent later in Round 1 of drafts in the summer. But it has long been a private RB club in the upper half of Round 1.\n\nFor next season, I think you have to consider Brown, Julio Jones, Odell Beckham Jr., Dez Bryant (with a healthy Romo) DeAndre Hopkins and Allen Robinson as first rounders, at least all of them should be in the discussion. Those are six wideouts I feel really good about, and there's not six running backs I feel as strongly about as a group only Todd Gurley and David Johnson are currently in my top 5 overall consideration). If you drafted RB in Round 1 this season, odds are that you ended the campaign wishing you hadn't - Adrian Peterson, Jamaal Charles, Marshawn Lynch, Eddie Lacy, Le'Veon Bell, Jeremy Hill, DeMarco Murray and C.J. Anderson were all in the Round 1 mix, and only one of them (AP) wasn't a disappointment.\n\nNext year, taking Antonio Brown or ODB ahead of the top RB options in your fantasy draft is most likely going to result in better night's sleep from September through December.\n\n3. The Tight End revolution is going stronger than ever\n\n\n\nSix tight ends entered Week 16 with an average of 10 or more fantasy points per game. If that holds, it will be the deepest double digit fantasy point TE class in the history of fantasy.In the '06 and '07 seasons, there were zero 10-point producers. Since then, the best we've seen is four tight ends reach that level.\n\nAs you may have noticed, the theme of the article is that the proliferation of the pass has had a dramatic impact across all positions in fantasy - deeper QB middle class, top wide receivers more reliable than top running backs ... It only makes sense that tight ends get swept up in the passing momentum. It makes Rob Gronkowski less of a slam-dunk mid-first round option next year when you start to consider potential upside contributions of Tyler Eifert (younger version of Gronk), Greg Olsen, Jordan Reed and next year's Gary Barnidge - hard to know who that will be, but we're getting to the point where we should expect someone random (like Barnidge) to emerge.", "White Sox reportedly continue to pursue Alex Gordon, Yoenis Cespedes": "The White Sox reportedly are still in the hunt for outfielders Yoenis Cespedes and Alex Gordon.\n\nNew reports surfaced on Tuesday that the White Sox continue to pursue the free agent outfielders, including one that lists the White Sox among the leaders for Cespedes, who was valued at 6.7 Wins Above Replacement last season by Fangraphs.com.\n\nWhile the White Sox have already made a series of moves this offseason sure to impact the roster, general manager Rick Hahn said earlier this month the team would stay aggressive on \u201cmultiple fronts.\u201d After they spruced up the infield with the additions of Todd Frazier and Brett Lawrie and two offensive-minded catchers were added, it appears the team\u2019s focus is now on the outfield.\n\n[RELATED - In pursuit of offense, White Sox haven't overlooked defense]\n\nOne factor that can\u2019t be overlooked is how the shelves are still stocked full of premium players with spring training roughly seven weeks away. Many suspected the $184-million deal Jason Heyward signed with the Cubs on Dec. 11 would break the ice and begin a wave of signings.\n\nBut Gordon, Cespedes and Justin Upton remain unsigned with the New Year right around the corner. A surplus of talent (Dexter Fowler also remains unsigned) could mean that prices have dropped, which likely gives the White Sox a better chance to add an outfielder.\n\nFoxsports.com\u2019s Ken Rosenthal suggested the White Sox are strong in their pursuit of the two outfielders on Tuesday. Meanwhile, MLB.com\u2019s Jesse Sanchez said the White Sox and Baltimore Orioles are considered in the lead \u201cfor now\u201d for the services of Cespedes.\n\nCespedes, 30, is expected to earn a bigger annual salary than Gordon and could command a deal in the five-year range. But, because he was traded last July, Cespedes \u2014 who hit .291/.328/.542 with 35 home runs last season \u2014 doesn\u2019t require the team he signs with to surrender a draft pick.\n\nWhile the White Sox have said they\u2019d prefer to hang on to their draft picks, including the compensatory selection for losing Jeff Samardzija, Hahn said it wouldn\u2019t stop them from signing a player if he were deemed the right fit.\n\n[SHOP: Gear up, White Sox fans!]\n\nGordon, who turns 32 this season, is expected to receive a lesser deal in the four-year range. The Kansas City Royals product and four-time Gold Glove winner hit .271/.377/.432 in 104 games last season and would tidy up an outfield that was minus-22 in Defensive Runs Saved, according to Fangraphs. But in order to sign Gordon, the White Sox would have to surrender their second-highest pick, which is expected to fall between 27-29 in next June\u2019s draft.\n\nWith Frazier, Lawrie, Alex Avila and Dioner Navarro in the mix, payroll for the White Sox 25-man roster already is hovering in the $115 million range.", "\u2018We did not know about an active plot,\u2019 U.S. ambassador to France tells Yahoo News": "French police enter the Eglise Neuve church after smashing the door as they secure the area during an operation in Saint-Denis, near Paris, on Nov. 18.

U.S. officials have said they have received multiple intelligence reports about potential Islamic State threats over the past year but that they invariably lack enough specifics about timing or place to allow law enforcement officials to take active measures to thwart them.\n\nThat seems to have been the case Friday night: Hartley said she was out dining with her husband, New York investment banker Ralph Schlosstein, at a small Japanese restaurant when she received an initial text from the U.S. Embassy about the attacks.\n\nShe was quickly whisked away by her security guards and spent the night at the ambassador\u2019s residence monitoring events.\n\nIn the days since, Hartley, a former fundraiser for President Obama, has been helping to coordinate the U.S. response. The U.S. Embassy has issued warnings to American citizens in Paris to exercise \u201cextreme caution,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to this week\u2019s visit to Paris by Secretary of State John Kerry, Hartley said there has been increased military and intelligence cooperation by the U.S., including regular contact with French authorities by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Lisa Monaco, President Obama\u2019s top counterterrorism adviser.\n\nSlideshow: Deadly raid in Saint Denis on Paris attack suspects >>>\n\n\n\nOne American was killed in the attacks, Hartley said, and an additional four U.S. citizens were injured \u2014 one at a restaurant and three others at the Bataclan concert hall.

He was 85.\n\nHis death was first reported by Red Sox announcer Jerry Remy on Twitter and later confirmed by the team, which said Malzone died of natural causes. After signing with the Sox in 1947, he spent 68 of the next 69 years in the team's employ as a player, scout, or special assistant.\n\n\u201cWe mourn the loss of a man we all came to know as \u2018Malzie,\u2019 who was venerated by Red Sox fans not only for his great glove at third base but for his blue-collar dedication to his craft,\u201d Red Sox chairman Tom Werner said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe played 150 games or more in seven consecutive seasons, and missed just a total of two games in his first four seasons. He brought that same commitment to the many years in which he served the club as a special assistant, and always was a welcome presence at Fenway Park. He will be missed, and we extend our condolences to his family.\u201d\n\nMalzone -- his career delayed by service in the Korean War -- became the Red Sox' regular third baseman in 1957 at the age of 27. The Sox had losing records in all but two of the nine years he played for them, culminating in a 100-loss season in 1965. But he was a bright spot during that bleak time, appearing in six All-Star Games and earning three Gold Gloves.\n\nDuring his career, Malzone batted .274 with 133 home runs and 728 RBI. He hit over .290 three times, and drove in 103 runs in 1957. In addition, he was a beacon of professionalism during that difficult time, when the Sox were famous (or infamous) for being a selfish, bickering bunch. Eventual Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski noted in his autobiography that Malzone was the only veteran player who made him feel welcome as a rookie in 1961, and the two remained friends over the years.\n\nThe Red Sox released him after the 1965 season and he spent the final year of his playing career with the then-California Angels. He returned to the Sox as a scout in 1967 and remained with the organization until his death. He was a scout for 35 years and continued to serve as a consultant after his retirement. He was elected to the Red Sox Hall of Fame in its inaugural year (1995).\n\nLast September, he threw out the first pitch on Labor Day before a game against the Blue Jays. Although he was taken to the mound in a wheelchair, he was able to stand to throw the pitch.\n\nMalzone and his wife, Amy, were married for 54 years until her death in 2006. He was the father of Jimmy Malzone, Paul Malzone, Frank Malzone Jr., Anne O'Neill, John Malzone, and the late Suzanne Malzone. He had eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\nReaction to Malzone's death, from baseball people to media members who knew him, was heartfelt:\n\nRIP Frank Malzone.

Brandon McManus shanked a 45-yard field goal. No matter. Osweiler just did it again in overtime and led the Broncos to a 20-17 win, clinching a playoff spot for Denver.\n\nThe Broncos got the ball first in overtime, and Osweiler hit a huge third-and-10 throw to Owen Daniels to get the drive started. The much-maligned Demaryius Thomas made a one-handed catch on third-and-3, then got another first down on a receiver screen. The Broncos couldn't get a touchdown on the opening drive of overtime, but McManus hit a 37-yard try to give them the lead. View photo . Brock Osweiler (AP)\n\n\n\nThe defense got a gift of a turnover to start overtime. Bengals quarterback AJ McCarron mishandled a shotgun snap and DeMarcus Ware beat him to the ball and recovered it to end the game.\n\nThe game had huge playoff implications. The Bengals would clinch a first-round bye with a win or the Broncos would have the inside track at a bye by winning. The Broncos would have lost control of the AFC West with a loss, and wouldn't even have been assured a playoff spot going into Week 17. The game had a playoff feel at 16 degrees, tied for the third coldest home game in Broncos history.\n\nAnd Osweiler was a the coolest guy in the place in the second half. Osweiler has had a bad habit of playing one good half and one bad one since he took over the starting job, and the Broncos are happy he was good in the second half and beyond on Monday night.\n\n\n\n[Yahoo Daily Fantasy: $10 could win you $20K in our $200K contest for Week 17]\n\nMcCarron started hot, hitting a number of huge throws in the first half. The Bengals had touchdown drives of 80 and 90 yards in the first half. McCarron was 12-of-17 for 119 yards in the first half. When the Bengals took a 14-0 lead, it seemed like Cincinnati might roll.\n\nThe Broncos battled back. Denver has been good in first halves and bad in second halves with Osweiler at quarterback, but flipped that around on Monday night. Osweiler hit Emmanuel Sanders for an 8-yard touchdown in the third quarter to cut Cincinnati's lead to 14-10. C.J. Anderson had a nice 39-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter to give Denver a 17-14 lead.\n\nThe Bengals tied it back up with a 52-yard field goal from Mike Nugent.\n\nDenver still looked in control, driving deep into Bengals territory in the final five minutes. But Anderson fumbled and the Bengals recovered at their 26-yard line with 4:05 left.\n\nThe Broncos defense got a stop, part of its great play the entire second half.\n\nDenver got the ball back with 1:40 left in regulation at its own 20 and Osweiler led a great drive. He hit three huge passes, to Owen Daniels for 16 and then 26 yards, and then a laser to Bennie Fowler for 16. That set up McManus for a game-winning field goal and he missed badly, well to the left.\n\nOsweiler gave McManus another shot in overtime. The kicker came through. Then the defense sealed the win. And the Broncos can feel a lot better about their positioning in the playoffs going into the season's final week.

Curry hit five 3-pointers in the final 3:15 of the first half - a quarter of the Warriors' 20 3s - on his way to a triple-double in Monday's 122-103 victory over Sacramento.\n\nBut the Kings hit 13 3s in 31 attempts, nine during a first half in which they put up 61 points and drew the ire of both recovering coach Steve Kerr at intermission and their current bench boss after it was over.\n\n\"Even though we can beat teams in a pick-up style game where the ball is getting slung around and guys are just catching and shooting, we need to work on being champions,\" Luke Walton said. \"That's executing on offense, that's protecting the ball and that's competing on the defensive end.\"\n\nThe Warriors could have their hands full defending the arc again against Dallas (18-13) and Houston, where they visit Thursday. Both teams have attempted more 3s per game in December than the Warriors' 30.1, and the Mavericks' 12.1 average makes since Dec. 6 lead the league while their 39.3 percentage trails only Washington and New Orleans.\n\nDallas hasn't been able to approach the Warriors' efficiency beyond the arc in recent meetings. Golden State has won the last seven, outscoring the Mavericks 279-153 from deep.\n\nAs they cap one of the best calendar years in NBA history, there are a few more milestones on the table for the Warriors in Texas. With a win Tuesday, they'll match the 2012 Spurs for the most wins in one year (72) since the 1996 Bulls won an NBA-record 74. And with victories in both Dallas and Houston, they'll be the first team to be 30 games over .500 on Jan. 1 since the 1971-72 Lakers were 36-3.\n\n\"It doesn't sound right,\" Curry said of the Warriors' many milestones. \"We've been playing this game for many, many years and we're just trying not to focus on the numbers but just how we're playing.\"\n\nThe Mavericks had to focus on the one team that beat Golden State before getting a crack at the champs themselves, and they made it three straight wins by beating Milwaukee 103-93 on Monday while forcing 18 turnovers and committing just four.\n\n\"We weren't even thinking about Golden State,\" Wesley Matthews said after scoring a game-high 22. \"You know, it was Chicago, and then it was Milwaukee. We can't overlook any team. We're not in a position to, and our margin for error is too small to do anything like that.\"\n\nBoth teams are banged up. Deron Williams has missed the last three games with a hamstring injury and is uncertain for Wednesday, though J.J. Barea has averaged 22 points and hit 13 3s in his absence.\n\nCurry is dealing with a calf injury he calls \"part of the regular-season grind,\" while Festus Ezeli came out of the Kings game with a foot injury but is expected to face the Mavs.\n\nLeandro Barbosa (shoulder) and Harrison Barnes (ankle) won't play on this trip, though Barnes is nearing a return.", "O'Malley: The Democratic Primary Is \u2018Rigged\u2019": "Which is more ridiculous, a political party that holds a primary but does its level best to prevent any real challenge to the frontrunner, or a candidate in that primary who stays in the race when he finds himself drawing just one supporter \u2013 one! \u2013 to an event in a key early voting state?\n\nThe Republican primary, dominated by the blustery Donald Trump, has attracted the most ridicule so far, for obvious reasons.

He added, \u201cI believe people understand that just as their economy is rigged, so too sometimes can be their politics.\u201d\n\nRelated: Can Bernie Sanders Steal Supporters from Donald Trump?\n\nO\u2019Malley has continued his campaign, despite the fact that his limited opportunities to get in front of a national audience appear to have contributed to a sense that his campaign was doomed from the start.\n\nOn Monday night, an event in Iowa drew exactly one voter, and even he wouldn\u2019t commit to voting or caucusing for the candidate.\n\n\u201cThe very last event of the night, we actually had a whopping total of one person show up, but by God, he was glad to see me. So we spent the time with him,\u201d O\u2019Malley said on MSNBC.\n\nTo be fair, there was a snowstorm in Iowa Monday.

In the eighth installment, we look at the hiring of Dusty Baker as manager...\n\nAfter the dismissal of Matt Williams, who was hired in the fall of 2013 without any previous MLB managerial experience, the Nationals set out this time around looking for a veteran manager, someone with a proven track record who wouldn't need time to learn on the job. That led them through an extensive search, one that included a bizarre saga involving a reported contract dispute with former Padres skipper Bud Black.\n\nDespite the unusual circumstances of their search, the Nationals ended up with a very solid result. In comes Dusty Baker, he of 20 seasons as an MLB manager, a man who has done absolutely everything in the profession except coach a team to a World Series title. He, in fact, came within one game of that goal in 2002 with the Giants.\n\nThere will be no learning curve for Baker, who at 66-years-old has seen and done just about everything in the game of baseball. He will step in on Day 1 ready to lead those in the Nats clubhouse, just as he did in San Francisco, Chicago and Cincinnati.\n\nThere are, of course, questions that come with Baker's hiring, as there was a reason he was available for the Nationals this offseason. There are reasons he was out of the game for two years between stops.\n\nIs he a retread manager whose best years are behind him? Can he adapt to new ways of thinking in baseball, given his past statements on analytics and history of wearing out pitchers? Time will tell on all of that, of course, but he does possess what the Nats appeared to be missing in the dugout under Williams.\n\nBaker is in many ways the anti-Matt Williams. He is not nearly as intense and buttoned-up, with a big focus on having fun and letting players be themselves. His experience should come in handy both within games and inside the clubhouse, where it's unlikely he will lose the respect of his players.\n\nHe also, as we have seen already, seems more likely to speak his mind. That could benefit the Nationals privately, and maybe even publicly as well. Williams was often criticized by fans for not reacting properly to important wins and losses. It does not seem like Baker will hold back, no matter the situation.\n\nThe Nationals decided to go in the exact opposite direction from the inexperienced Williams by hiring Baker, who ironically was his mentor and former manager. Whether they made the right decision has yet to be determined, but there is no question it will be a much different dynamic with Baker in charge.\n\n-\n\nMore from the countdown:", "Suns-Spurs Preview": "As much as this game appears to be a mismatch, the San Antonio Spurs were just made very aware they can't take any team lightly and the Phoenix Suns just showed they still have a chance to beat anyone.\n\nStill, Phoenix winning in San Antonio on Wednesday night would be arguably the biggest stunner of the season.\n\nWhereas the Spurs have won a franchise-record 27 consecutive home games and have lost once in their last 10 overall, the beleaguered Suns have dropped five straight and are missing their top scorer.\n\nThe Spurs (27-6) have won all four meetings in 2015, holding the usually high-scoring Suns to an average of 86 points. San Antonio is allowing a league-low 88.8 per game this season, and Phoenix (12-21) is surrendering an average of 105.2 and an NBA-worst 46.8 percent shooting.\n\nHowever, the Spurs know all the numbers don't matter if they have the same mindset they did Monday, when they trailed by as many as 12 points and struggled to beat Minnesota 101-95.\n\n\"I thought we came out and didn't respect them the way they're supposed to be respected as a pro team,\" said forward David West, who looked ahead to the Suns game seeing the need for a better effort.\n\n\"... It's the same sorta deal, younger team with a bunch of athletes. We're just gonna have to be more sound and more solid than we were tonight.\"\n\nWhile the Timberwolves had lost 20 of their previous 21 visits to San Antonio, the Suns have won only once in their last 11 there.\n\n\"Phoenix is a very dangerous team just like Minnesota,\" guard Danny Green said. \"Any given night in this league you can lose if you're not on top of your game.\"\n\nMonday's victory made San Antonio the third West team to open 18-0 at home, joining the 1985-86 Houston Rockets and the 1977-78 Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nLittle-used rookie Boban Marjanovic excited the crowd with 17 points, hitting all seven of his field-goal attempts.\n\n''Yeah, it's amazing. The fans are amazing,'' the 7-foot-3 center said. ''Tonight - every night - but tonight they really gave us support. It was like six players on the court.\"\n\nSan Antonio hasn't dropped a regular-season home game since a March 12 overtime loss to Cleveland, the same team Phoenix just gave a scare.\n\nBrandon Knight's 3-pointer with 1:28 left put the Suns within one point, but the Eastern Conference leaders emerged with a 101-97 road victory.\n\n''We came out and fought the game all the way down to the last minute,'' Knight said. ''So I think we put ourselves in a position to win or at least try to win.\"\n\nIt was Phoenix's first game since learning Eric Bledsoe had a torn meniscus, and the team announced Tuesday that he would miss the remainder of the season following surgery. Devin Booker had 10 points starting in his place, and T.J. Warren scored 23 to lead five Suns in double figures.\n\n\"It's encouraging that we're without Eric, we're out there a lot of time with Alex (Len) and Devin and T.J., some of our young guys - that's a good effort,\" coach Jeff Hornacek said. \"You can't fault that.\"\n\nBledsoe also missed the only matchup with the Spurs this season, a 98-84 road loss Nov. 23 when the Suns committed a season-high 28 turnovers.\n\nMaybe the only reason the game wasn't a total blowout was Markieff Morris scoring a season-high 28 points. It's unclear if Morris will play Wednesday despite completing a two-game suspension for throwing a towel at Hornacek, with reports surfacing that he must apologize to the team if he wants to return.\n\nHe's long been rumored to be unhappy with the Suns and asked to be traded.", "Jaguars owner says head coach Gus Bradley will return in 2016": "Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan announced Tuesday what many suspected but what had yet to be anywhere close to official.\n\nGus Bradley will be back at head coach in 2016.\n\nHere's the full release (via Jacksonville.com) from Khan, issued by the team:\n\n\"I spoke to Gus Bradley today to confirm to him that he will continue as head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2016. It\u2019s evident to see how far we\u2019ve come in many aspects of our game, and Gus deserves a lot of credit for that progress. It\u2019s also evident the considerable work that remains to be done to be where we expect to be at this time next season, which is well above where we stand today. And Gus understands that. Dave Caldwell and I also spoke today and we are both confident that Gus will make 2016 the best year of his career. In the meantime, I expect his coaching staff and team to respond favorably to this news in preparation for Houston on Sunday and then begin thinking about what more they can provide next season. We have high ambitions.\"\n\nIt has been a baby-step improvement in three seasons under Bradley \u2014 a 4-12 record his first season, followed by 3-13 in 2014 and 5-10 this season with one game remaining, against the playoff-bound Houston Texans.\n\nThe team had started letting out whispers around midseason, right about when it was clear Blake Bortles was a promising quarterback and the team was beating bottom-rung opponents, that Bradley was likely to return. But the recent one-score losses to the San Diego Chargers and Tennessee Titans (two teams likely picking ahead of them in next year's draft) were not a good look, nor was Sunday's throttling by the New Orleans Saints.\n\nStill, there's promise here. Bortles, Allen Robinson, Allen Hurns, Julius Thomas, T.J. Yeldon and an improved offensive line make up an exciting nucleus on one side of the ball. Losjng No. 3 overall pick Dante Fowler was a blow the team never recovered from defensively, and it will be imperative for the team to make big strides on that side of the ball \u2014 Bradley's specialty \u2014 for him to continue working with the team beyond 2016.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nEric Edholm is a writer for Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports.

The result undoubtedly impacted fantasy titles. Both Pittsburgh and Green Bay contributed two players to the nine-man All-Bust Lineup at the worst possible time for both their respective postseason dreams and the fantasy owners of their key players.\n\nNotes: Each week\u2019s entries are determined by calculating the difference between the projected Yahoo point totals and the actual outputs of each player. PointAfter visualizations illustrate the players with the worst sums. Players who played less than a half due to injury were not considered.\n\n\n\n[Week 16's perfect fantasy lineup: Top scorers at each position]\n\nQB: Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers\n\nProjected points (position rank): 21.7 (5th)\n\nActual points (position rank): 5.8 (32nd)\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s uninspired showing in a 20-17 defeat to Baltimore was shocking, as Roethlisberger and the league\u2019s highest-flying pass offense fell flat against a familiar opponent.\n\nBig Ben completed 24-of-34 passes for just 215 yards and two interceptions, and it could have been even worse \u2013 he had a pick-six at Baltimore\u2019s goal line called back due to a penalty. Without DeAngelo Williams\u2019 solid day at the office (153 all-purpose yards, two rushing touchdowns), the Steelers would have been kept out of the end zone by one of the league\u2019s worst defenses.\n\nThat shocking development certainly turned countless fantasy championships.\n\nRB1: Antonio Andrews, Titans\n\nProjected points: 8.7 (26th)\n\nActual points: -1.9 (N/A)\n\nAndrews had a nightmarish Sunday against the resurgent Texans. He was given four opportunities, and the results were a fumble, interception, incomplete pass and a one-yard gain on the ground.\n\nUnfortunately for Andrews, who\u2019s averaged just 3.7 yards per carry, it might have been his last chance to impress in Tennessee with a new coaching staff almost certainly taking over this offseason.\n\nThe Titans could very well elect to give David Cobb, who\u2019s been injured for much of this season, most of the available carries in Week 17 to see what the rookie can do. It\u2019s not like any of their tailbacks have stood out.\n\nRB2: Spencer Ware, Chiefs\n\nProjected points: 10.1 (15th)\n\nActual points: 1.5 (71st)\n\nWare was expected to split carries with Charcandrick West against Cleveland after bruised ribs cost him a soft Week 15 matchup vs. the Ravens, but he was clearly No. 2 in the pecking order. He rushed five times for 15 carries, while West logged 14 carries for 62 yards.\n\nThough Andy Reid insisted Ware and West would share the workload upon the latter\u2019s return from a hamstring injury, the only two times Ware has tallied double-digit carries were during the two games West was sidelined. Temper your expectations for Ware in Week 17.\n\n\n\nWR1: Martavis Bryant, Steelers\n\nProjected points: 13.0 (2nd)\n\nActual points: 1.0 (T-93rd)\n\nAntonio Brown and Martavis Bryant were projected as fantasy\u2019s top two wideouts for Week 16, as the NFL\u2019s most explosive passing offense appeared set for a monstrous day against a Ravens secondary that came into Sunday with the most fantasy points allowed to wideouts.\n\nInstead, one of the most disappointing collective performances by an offense during Championship Week in recent memory unfolded. Brown collected a pedestrian 6.1 points, while Bryant had easily his worst game of 2015.\n\nThe speedy deep threat wasn\u2019t thrown to until the second half and finished with three targets, which marked his first game with fewer than seven this season. Bryant caught just one pass, and dropped his other two chances. It was a confounding showing at the worst possible time.\n\nWR2: Amari Cooper, Raiders\n\nProjected points: 9.1 (26th)\n\nActual points: 1.0 (T-93rd)\n\nCooper\u2019s extreme boom-or-bust rookie campaign continued on Christmas Eve. One week after recording the best fantasy performance of his young professional career (6-120-2), Cooper caught just two balls on three targets for 10 yards while battling a foot injury.\n\nThe rookie\u2019s fantasy owners were put into a panic after when Cooper was initially credited with a 20-yard loss via an extremely ill-advised lateral to end the first half. That would have put him at -0.9 points on the night.\n\nStill, Cooper\u2019s substandard outing must have felt like a heaping pile of coal for his fantasy owners.\n\n\n\nTE: Benjamin Watson, Saints\n\nProjected points: 8.9 (5th)\n\nActual points: 0.5 (T-50th)\n\nBenjamin Watson taught the owners who started him this week a lesson about keeping track of the injury report \u2013 one that his owners probably wished they\u2019d learned before Championship Week.\n\nWatson didn\u2019t practice all week due to a knee injury, but was active on Sunday. Owners hopeful he\u2019d attract the same amount of attention he\u2019d garnered in recent weeks (10 targets per game in Weeks 12-15) were wishing they\u2019d benched a clearly hobbled Watson. He recorded a lone catch for five yards on two measly targets.\n\nThe 12-year veteran should still be applauded for putting up arguably his best statistical receiving season at age 35.\n\n\n\nFLEX: Randall Cobb, Packers\n\nProjected points: 9.7 (20th)\n\nActual points: 1.7 (85th)\n\nCobb has probably been the single most disappointing flex player (RB/WR/TE) in fantasy, barring guys who suffered injuries. So it\u2019s all too fitting that he rounds out the fantasy season here, which marks his position-high fourth appearance.\n\nCobb caught just three passes for 15 yards against Arizona, even without Tyrann Mathieu missing from Arizona\u2019s defense. That\u2019s five straight games without a touchdown for the 25-year-old, who would be a risky play in Week 17 against Minnesota\u2019s excellent secondary if are still fighting for a title.\n\nD/ST: Philadelphia Eagles\n\nProjected points: 8.5 (5th)\n\nActual points: 1.0 (T-28th)\n\nThe Eagles faced a must-win game on Saturday against Washington to stay in the playoff race, but came out flat and were never really in it. Jordan Reed torched Philly for two touchdowns in the first quarter en route to the 38-24 loss.\n\nAfter a promising start, Philadelphia\u2019s defense has averaged 35.6 points allowed over its past five games, with just five turnovers over that span.\n\nKicker: Mason Crosby, Packers\n\nProjected points: 8.1 (17th)\n\nActual points: 0.0 (T-31st)\n\nJust as it\u2019s fitting for his teammate Randall Cobb to be on the final weekly All-Bust Lineup, so is it appropriate that Crosby is the kicker in this space. Since a kicker\u2019s fantasy value is almost wholly derived from the strength of his offense, Crosby\u2019s placement is a symbol for the downfall of Green Bay\u2019s once vaunted attack.\n\nCrosby had some goodwill built up among fantasy owners from previous seasons as the kicker for Green Bay\u2019s high-flying offense, but he was overvalued this year. He put up a goose egg this week as the Packers reached a new low in their 38-8 loss to Arizona, the worst defeat of the Aaron Rodgers era.\n\nCrosby concludes Week 16 tied for 13th in points among kickers despite ranking fifth in owned percentage in Yahoo leagues.\n\nKeep an eye out for the All-Bust team of the season next week.\n\nWill Laws is a writer for PointAfter, a sports data aggregation and visualization website that's part of the Graphiq network.", "Ozil at peak of powers, guiding Arsenal's title charge": "It's taken three seasons for Mesut Ozil to finally come good in English soccer.\n\nThe Germany playmaker's inconsistent performances and seemingly languid manner often overshadowed his undoubted talent and eye for a pass. He has divided opinion more than almost any player in the Premier League in his time at Arsenal.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nOzil is now at the peak of his powers - back to the form he regularly showed at Real Madrid - and could yet be the guiding force behind Arsenal's first league title since 2004.\n\nHe arguably saved his best display of the season for Monday, scoring one goal and setting up another in a 2-0 win over Bournemouth that has lifted Arsenal - maybe only briefly - into first place.\n\n''As the opposing manager, I did not enjoy his performance,'' Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe said.\n\nView gallery Arsenal's Mesut Ozil, centre, celebrates with Hector Bellerin, left, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain \u2026\n\nArsene Wenger certainly did.\n\nThe Arsenal manager has always found it strange when fans and media got on Ozil's back in the player's first two seasons in England, following a move from Madrid for 42 million pounds ($70 million). Wenger said the critics weren't appreciating Ozil's talents.\n\nWenger was right. Ozil has 16 assists - just four adrift of the record for a single Premier League season - and three goals this season. He is also controlling games single-handedly, finding space where it appeared there was none and dictating Arsenal's tempo.\n\nThen there's his vision. He created nine goal-scoring chances alone against Bournemouth, with a variety of through-balls and passes that had Wenger gushing.\n\n''Something that I enjoy very much is the timing of his passes,'' said Wenger, one of the game's purists. ''If you are thinking in the stand that he has to give the ball now, that is when he has done it. You have not even finished thinking and the ball has gone.\n\nView gallery Arsenal's Mesut Ozil celebrates after scoring a goal, during the English Premier League soccer m \u2026\n\n''That is difficult to achieve.''\n\nWenger has had a player like that in the past, in club great Dennis Bergkamp.\n\n''Yes, he reminds me of Bergkamp,'' Wenger said. ''Bergkamp was more of a goal-scorer than him and Ozil is more about assists, but now Ozil is becoming more of a goal-scorer, so they are really comparable.\n\n''Overall he is the complete player,'' Wenger continued. ''I've not seen many players of his quality. He's an exceptional player and you have to give me credit - I always defended that point of view even when people were skeptical.''\n\nArsenal's injury problems have been hurt the midfield this season. Currently, the team is without Jack Wilshere, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Francis Coquelin.\n\nBut Ozil is an ever-present, fully fit - mentally and physically - and a different player to the one that appeared jaded at times in the post-World Cup year last season.\n\n''Mesut always gets the song in the right tone,'' Wenger said.", "Masters field just under 90 heading into the New Year": "Heading into the New Year, the 2016 Masters field will sit at 89 players.\n\nThe field grew by 15 players with the release of the final Official World Golf Ranking of 2015.

That trend holds true this year, with the likes of Danny Willett, up-and-comer Matthew Fitzpatrick and Victor Dubuisson getting into the Masters field on the strength of their world ranking.\n\nLee Westwood was the last man to get in the Masters on the top-50 exemption, improving this week one spot from 51st to 50th, bumping Chris Kirk to 51st.

(Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Bettmann/Corbis, George Bush Presidential Library and Museum)\n\nThis story is part of a weeklong Yahoo series marking one year since the opening of relations between the United States and Cuba.\n\nAn international terrorist enters the United States illegally, with no visa. FBI agents alert their superiors; the suspect is linked to more than 40 bombings \u2014 including blowing up a civilian airliner. He makes it clear he has no intention of renouncing violence to achieve his goals.\n\nIt\u2019s a scenario that today would have public officials and politicians of all stripes expressing outrage \u2014 and demanding that the suspect be booted out immediately, or locked up indefinitely. But 25 years ago, the accused terrorist in question, a fiery, white-haired Cuban exile by the name of Orlando Bosch, was freed by the U.S. government in a deal cleared by the White House \u2014 thanks in part to the backing he received from the then president\u2019s son Jeb Bush.\n\nThe story of Jeb Bush and Orlando Bosch is from another era in U.S.-Cuba relations, when passions about Fidel Castro\u2019s regime ran high in south Florida. For many Cuban-Americans, Bosch was a symbol of anti-Communist resistance \u2014 a pediatrician turned freedom fighter who, after receiving early backing from the CIA, had dedicated his life to overthrowing the Cuban government by any means necessary. \u201cI am a fighter and a patriot. \u2026 In war, everything is valid,\u201d he told Ann Louise Bardach, a journalist who interviewed Bosch extensively for her book \u201cWithout Fidel: A Death Foretold in Miami, Havana and Washington.\u201d\n\nWhen the Justice Department in the summer of 1989 moved to deport Bosch from the country, labeling him \u201can unrepentant terrorist\u201d and \u201ca danger to the community,\u201d Bush \u2014 then a Miami businessman who had served as chairman of the Dade County Republican Party \u2014 was among a number of local political figures who rushed to his defense, even making a highly publicized visit to meet with Bosch\u2019s diabetic brother, who was then on a hunger strike protesting the decision.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush during a press conference in 1989. (Photo: AP)\n\nBush\u2019s backing of Bosch received media attention at the time. But documents recently reviewed by Yahoo News in the presidential library of President George H.W. Bush and in Justice Department archives shed new light on the case, revealing how political interests \u2014 including a congressional race in which Jeb Bush was the campaign manager \u2014 influenced his father\u2019s White House to ultimately arrange for Bosch to win his freedom.\n\n\u201cMr. Bosch clearly has broad based support in the community,\u201d White House staffers Sichan Siv and Shiree Sanchez wrote in a June 30, 1989, memo to the president, mentioning that among his \u201ckey supporters\u201d was \u201cyour son Jeb.\u201d\n\nSiv and Sanchez wrote that the Justice Department decision to deport Bosch had \u201ccreated a difficult political atmosphere in Miami.\u201d They complained that the Justice Department had failed to show \u201cany political sensitivity\u201d in its handling of the Bosch case \u2014 and warned about potentially damaging fallout.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this decision has further complicated our hopes for a Republican victory in the special election (for the Claude Pepper seat) held in late August,\u201d they wrote, referring to an upcoming election in which the congressional campaign of the GOP candidate \u2014 then-state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, running for the seat of the recently deceased Democratic Congressman Claude Pepper \u2014 would be managed by Jeb Bush.\n\nRead More\n\nThe White House staffers recommended that White House officials meet with Bosch\u2019s supporters at the White House and \u201cdiscuss ways by which the Justice Department can be more responsive to their concerns.\u201d (Three weeks later, President Bush flew on Air Force One with Bosch\u2019s leading supporter, Ros-Lehtinen, to campaign for her in Miami. She later told reporters she pressed the president to free Bosch on \u201chumanitarian\u201d grounds.)\n\nThe documents on file at the Bush library reviewed by Yahoo News do not spell out exactly how the White House planned to make the Justice Department more \u201cresponsive\u201d to Bosch\u2019s supporters. Nor do they indicate whether Jeb Bush directly pressed his father or other White House officials on the case \u2014 as some critics would later allege. (Bush does not appear to have ever spoken publicly about his role in Bosch\u2019s case and, at the time, refused to answer questions about any conversations he had with his father on the subject. Asked for comment, Tim Miller, a spokesman for Bush\u2019s presidential campaign, emailed: \u201cAs reported at the time, Jeb was not an outspoken advocate on this case. He was familiar with it as an advocate for the Cuban community.\u201d\n\nMiller added, \u201cJeb\u2019s opposition to Obama\u2019s Cuba policy and advocacy for resolve to defeat terror in all its forms couldn\u2019t be more clear. This decades-old case that he was not involved with has no bearing on that.\u201d)\n\nBut the documents on file at the Bush library do make clear where the president\u2019s sympathies were. Another \u201cmemorandum for the president\u201d sent by White House staffer David Q. Bates forwarded a New York Daily News op-ed headlined \u201cPersecution of an Anti-Communist.\u201d In the piece, Bosch was described as \u201cFidel Castro\u2019s most feared enemy\u201d and a \u201cliving symbol of [the] struggle to regain Cuba\u2019s independence.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood editorial, GB,\u201d the president wrote on the cover page of Bates\u2019 memo.\n\nWhat happened over the next year was a steady evolution in the Justice Department\u2019s position, closely monitored by top officials at the White House. Bosch, who had once fought with Castro, had fled Cuba for Miami in July 1960, but had never been approved as a legal resident and left the United States in 1974. When he returned 14 years later from Venezuela, he was detained by immigration authorities in a Miami jail as an \u201cexcludable\u201d alien who had entered the country without a visa.\n\nWith Bosch\u2019s lawyers challenging the move to deport him, and seeking political asylum, the State Department mounted an effort to find someplace else to send him, approaching more than 30 countries to see if they would be willing to accept Bosch, government records show. But given Bosch\u2019s violent past, there were no takers.\n\n\u201cWe were embarrassed to have to ask other countries to have to take him in,\u201d recalls Vicki J. Huddleston, who served as the State Department\u2019s director of Cuban affairs at the time.\n\nOrlando Bosch in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1976, after a court appearance in connection with his arrest for questioning about the crash of a Cuban airliner. (Photo: AP)\n\nMuch of the incriminating evidence against Bosch had been spelled out in a damning 18-page memo prepared by Joe Whitley, then acting associate attorney general, based in part on classified CIA and FBI files. Though there were no pending criminal charges against him in the United States, Bosch, Whitley wrote, was a convicted felon: He had been imprisoned for firing a recoilless rifle at a Havana-bound Polish freighter in the Port of Miami in 1968. Upon his release, he fled the country, violating his parole. He then founded an anti-Castro terror group that was linked to assassination plots, attempted kidnappings and \u201cnumerous bombings\u201d in Miami and New York as well as throughout Latin America, Whitley\u2019s memo states. In 1974, Bosch had publicly admitted sending package bombs to Cuban embassies in Lima, Madrid, Ottawa and Buenos Aires.\n\nThen, in 1976, Bosch had been arrested in Venezuela for the bombing of a civilian Cuban airliner that killed 73 people, including teenage members of the Cuban national fencing team (the worst act of terrorist violence in the Western Hemisphere until 9/11).\n\nAlthough Bosch was ultimately acquitted in a Venezuelan court, Whitley noted that evidence at the trial showed that the two men who were convicted \u201cwere in contact with Bosch both before and after the bombing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor 30 years, Bosch has been resolute and unwavering in his advocacy of terrorist violence,\u201d Whitley wrote. \u201cHis actions have been those of a terrorist, unfettered by laws or human decency, threatening and inflicting violence without regard to the identity of his victims.\u201d He added: \u201cThe United States cannot tolerate the inherent inhumanity of terrorism as a way of settling disputes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of the language in that memo,\u201d Whitley, who later served as general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, said in a recent interview. Whitley added said he had \u201cabsolute confidence\u201d in the strength of the intelligence linking Bosch to terrorism, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not unsympathetic to people who want freedom [in countries like Cuba]. But not when innocent people are harmed.\u201d\n\nPhotos of victims at the Col\u00f3n Cemetery in Havana in 2006, during a ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the Cubana Airlines plane crash. (Photo: Javier Galeano/AP)\n\nFor their part, Bosch\u2019s lawyers vigorously resisted the government\u2019s efforts. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government could prove any of it,\u201d George Yoss, one of Bosch\u2019s lawyers at the time, said in a recent interview about the evidence in the Whitley memo. He described Bosch as \u201calways a gentleman. He was extremely personable.\u201d\n\nYoss added: \u201cThe issue was, what do you do with this guy? You can\u2019t just keep him in jail indefinitely with no charges against him, only allegations.\u201d\n\nAt the Justice Department, officials grew frustrated \u2014 and believed the State Department was dragging its feet in finding a new home for Bosch, at the behest of a White House trying to mollify the anti-Castro community in south Florida, according to internal department files recently discovered by Yahoo News at the University of Pittsburgh, where then Attorney General Richard Thornburgh had donated his papers.\n\nMargaret Love, then associate deputy attorney general, noted on Jan. 16, 1990, that the effort to deport Bosch had been constrained by what was understood to be \u201cthe president\u2019s wishes\u201d \u2014 that he could be sent only to a country \u201cwhere he would be relatively safe from Cuban agents.\u201d Robert Mueller, then assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division (and, much later, FBI director), later complained in another memo of State\u2019s \u201classitude\u201d in the effort to find a country to take Bosch. A May 11, 1990, memo to Mueller from Love quotes a State Department counterterrorism official as informing Justice that \u201cState\u2019s relatively relaxed efforts to find a country to take Dr. Bosch reflect what it understands to be the present disposition of the White House in the matter.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the Justice Department relented and informed White House counsel C. Boyden Gray and then deputy chief of staff Andrew Card it would agree to a deal to free Bosch to live with his family in Miami. There were conditions imposed: Bosch had to agree to be monitored, stay at home for all but three hours of the day, pledge to renounce violence and promise to avoid contact with any of his old anti-Castro confederates.\n\nOrlando Bosch speaks to the media on July 17, 1990, following his release from U.S. federal prison after 13 years in Venezuelan and American prisons on suspicion of terrorism. (Photo: Bettmann/Corbis)\n\nOn July 17, 1990, Bosch walked free \u2014 and promptly thumbed his nose at the Justice Department. He held a news conference and called the deal with Justice \u201cridiculous\u201d and a \u201cfarce.\u201d And he vowed to talk to any friends and supporters he wanted to. \u201cThey [the Justice Department] purchased the chain, but they don\u2019t have the monkey,\u201d he said.\n\nThe resolution did not go down well at the Justice Department. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for any more terrorists to be turned loose on society,\u201d recalled Thornburgh, who was attorney general at the time, in a recent interview with Yahoo News. \u201cIt was hard for me to figure out why anybody would be making a case to turn him loose.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut for Bosch\u2019s defenders, his release was justified.\n\nThe Bosch case would resonate for years to come. Cuban officials repeatedly pressed for Bosch and one of his longtime associates \u2014 Luis Posada Carriles, another alleged co-conspirator in the airline bombing plot \u2014 to be extradited to Cuba to stand trial on terrorism charges. The Cubans also contended that their need to thwart such plots was a main reason they dispatched the spy network known as La Red Avispa (the Wasp Network) to south Florida in the 1990s \u2014 five of whose agents were later arrested by the FBI in a notorious spy case that would not get resolved until last year, when President Obama freed the last remaining members as part of the deal to begin normalizing relations.\n\nBosch died in 2011 at the age of 84. As for Jeb Bush, he has maintained his silence about his own role in the Bosch case, although the issue did briefly pop up in the news in Florida in 2002, when he appointed Raoul Cantero, another of Bosch\u2019s lawyers (and a grandson of former Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista), to the Florida Supreme Court. Bush brushed aside any questions about Cantero\u2019s representation of his notorious former client.\n\n\u201cEverybody has a right to an attorney \u2014 it\u2019s one of the foundational aspects of our legal system,\u201d he said then. \u201cAnd I have no problems that Raoul was part of the team defending Orlando Bosch.\u201d Cantero, for his part, told Yahoo News that his prior representation of Bosch had nothing to do with his appointment. \u201cI never discussed Orlando Bosch with Jeb Bush,\u201d he said.\n\nSee more stories on this topic >>>", "Neal scores twice and Predators beat Rangers 5-3": "No one expected much from this year's San Francisco 49ers, especially the Vegas sports books who have made them underdogs in every game this season.\n\nYahoo Sports' Shaun King and Graham Watson look ahead to the Orange Bowl, in which the Sooners and Tigers will meet in a bowl game for the second straight season.\n\nYahoo Sports' Greg Whyshynski answers your social media questions on all things hockey, like where Shea Weber would fit best if traded, who's the leading ROY candidate and what's wrong with Jonathan Toews?\n\nYahoo Sports' Shaun King and Graham Watson look ahead to the Cotton Bowl, which will feature a pair of old colleagues - Spartans head coach Mark Dantonio and Tide head coach Nick Saban - squaring off.\n\nThat figure comes from a new analysis released Wednesday by state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who looked at the number of hunting and fishing licenses and permits sold as well as the overall economic impact of outdoor recreation.\n\nSanta Claus swapped his sleigh for a surfboard at Sydney's Bondi Beach as hundreds of Australians broke a world record for the largest ever surf lesson.

(AP) -- Leading 2-1 after two periods against one of the league's top offenses, the Nashville Predators successfully went into attack mode to close things out.\n\nJames Neal scored twice, Nashville scored three times to open the final period and the Predators held off the New York Rangers 5-3 on Monday night.\n\nCraig Smith, Ryan Ellis and Neal scored in the first 11:13 of the third period, making two late goals by the Rangers meaningless. Filip Forsberg also scored, Mike Ribeiro had three assists and Roman Josi had two assists.

''Whatever your name is.''\n\nBuescher smiled and graciously signed an autograph, his name now known to a new fan.\n\nBuescher's name is stamped just as permanently in the NASCAR history book as the 2015 Xfinity Series champion.\n\nNow come the offseason spoils for his racing reward.\n\nThe 23-year-old Buescher hit a Philadelphia Eagles game, saw the Liberty Bell (''I swear I didn't break it! Haha,'' he tweeted), toured Independence Hall, sampled cheesesteaks and, yes, ran the steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art well known to anyone who's seen ''Rocky'' and that famous training run by Sylvester Stallone.\n\nFirst, he needed a little coaching on the purpose of his jog.\n\n''I have not actually seen the movies,'' he said. ''I'm ashamed to say it.''\n\nBuescher reaped his biggest reward last week when he signed a deal to drive the No. 34 Ford for Front Row Motorsports in the Sprint Cup series. Buescher made six Cup starts in 2015, never finishing better than 20th. His preference was to defend his championship in the second-tier NASCAR series. Instead, he'll basically spend 2016 as the fourth Jack Roush driver because of a shared technical alliance between the organizations.\n\n''It can be a good deal,'' Buescher said. ''Maybe a little sooner than I hoped. But you've got to take it, right?''\n\nBuescher, winner of two races with 11 top five finishes, said he was not signed for a full 36-race season and still wanted to run eight to 12 Xfinity races. He wasn't sure Front Row would field a second car in 2016.\n\n''It's way too early in the process and it wasn't supposed to be announced yet,'' he said. ''There should be a second car but they're still working everything out.''\n\nFront Row fielded three entries in 2015 and David Ragan and Brett Moffitt also drove for the team. With Carl Edwards gone, Roush struggled and failed to place a car in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. Greg Biffle was 20th in the standings, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. was 25th and Trevor Bayne 29th.\n\n''The Cup performance is not where we'd like it to be,'' Buescher said. ''I guarantee you, there's nobody in the shop that's happy with where we're running right now. This is a good time for us to regroup.''\n\nBuescher said his Xfinity championship crew chief Scott Graves will join him at Front Row.\n\n''Some parts of it are a little bit of a bummer,'' Buescher said. ''Our team from last year is not my team for this year. You build a bond with those guys and awesome friendships and now Scott's the only one I'm going to be working with. That part is the worst part about it.''\n\nBuescher might even have one more championship run left in him this offseason - his girlfriend is pushing him to become a Carolina Panthers fan. He's attended two NFL games in his life, an Eagles-Panthers game and the Eagles' win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nHe was in Philadelphia because Xfinity is Comcast's residential cable and Internet provider.\n\n''I've been to more Eagles games than Panthers, which is kind of sad,'' he said.\n\nHe didn't mind when he left Lincoln Financial Field on Sunday with his own Eagles jersey and his car number, 60, on the back.\n\n''That's pretty cool,'' he said. ''There are definitely some things to like about this city.''\n\nWalking around with his championship trophy tops the list.", "How Qatar Is Funding al-Qaeda -- and Why That Could Help the US": "Ask Americans to name the terror group they fear most, and they\u2019ll probably says ISIS, even though it was al-Qaeda that killed more than 3,000 people on 9/11/2001. Compared to ISIS, al-Qaeda is seen as the \u201cdevil we know,\u201d not the band of barbaric thugs who burn people alive, rape children, and destroy or pilfer historic artifacts for sale on the black market.\n\nThe rivalry between the two terror groups has even prompted the unthinkable\u2014that the U.S. and al-Qaeda would somehow work together to defeat ISIS. Last August General David Petraeus, former CIA director and commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, urged the Pentagon to consider empowering al-Qaeda\u2019s al-Nusra Front in Syria to fight ISIS. Petraeus, like others, believe Nusra is \u201cmoderate\u201d compared with the tactics of the Taliban or ISIS, and could be an asset. But aligning with the lesser of two evils of terrorism is a policy fraught with pitfalls.\n\nRelated: Reclaiming the Title \u2018King of Jihad\u2019 Means al-Qaeda Will Target the West\n\nAl-Qaeda has been relatively quiet ever since Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. Special Forces in 2011. But cutting off the head of the snake doesn\u2019t mean it still can\u2019t strike. Al-Qaeda is regrouping, reorganizing and replenishing their bank accounts in preparation for their next nefarious terrorist activities. As the mother organization that spawned ISIS, al-Qaeda, which has many branches, is now competing with its unruly progeny for recruits, money and leadership of the global jihadist crusade.\n\nIn the minds of many, al-Qaeda is still the mother ship, providing the rationale and incentive for jihad. One of al-Qaeda\u2019s top lieutenants inspired the San Bernardino terrorists, despite their loyalty to ISIS, according to The Washington Post. Syed Farook and his neighbor, Enrique Marquez Jr. were radicalized by Anwar al-Awlaki who was born in the U.S. and killed four years ago by a CIA drone.\n\nToday, Al-Qaeda is not working alone. It\u2019s getting help from one of the United States\u2019 Middle East allies\u2014Qatar. A little noticed event highlights Qatar\u2019s influence.\n\nA prisoner swap between the Lebanese government and al-Qaeda's branch in Syria, Al-Nusra Front in early December showed how powerful the group has become on the ground. The deal released 16 Lebanese soldiers and police officers who were captured during a joint ISIS-al-Nusra operation along with 29 civilians, some of whom are known terrorists.\n\nRelated: Can the U.S. Use al-Qaeda Fighters to Defeat ISIS? David Petraeus Has a Plan\n\nThe heart of the agreement guarantees al-Nusra free reign inside what had been a safe haven in Lebanon\u2019s Hamid valley, bordering Syria, with access to the Lebanese town of Arsal. After the deal was signed, TV footage broadcast by Al Jazeera Arabic showed an armed group of al-Qaeda fighters with the group's black banners cheering al-Qaeda\u2019s victory. Lebanon\u2019s Minister of Interior, Nouhad Machnouk, put it bluntly, saying Arsal is occupied by al-Nusra Front.\n\nThe official mediator in the Lebanese deal was the small Gulf country of Qatar, which hosts the advanced headquarters of the U.S. Central Command. Sources claim that Qatar paid al-Nusra $25 million and persuaded the terror group to accept the deal. The Qatari Ambassador to Lebanon denied paying the ransom, but it is not the first time a government paid al-Qaeda a ransom to release a hostage and then denied it. Qatar subscribes to the same ideology that Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda and ISIS adhere to -- the extreme version of Islam called Wahhabism. Osama bin Laden and most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals.\n\nIn a detailed paper on Qatar\u2019s relations with terror, Denis MacEoin, a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Gatestone Institute reveals that four branches of the Qatari government are in charge of relations with armed groups in Syria and Libya. These are the Foreign and Defense Ministries, the Intelligence Agency, and the office of the Emir. Large amounts of money are passed to intermediaries in Turkey, and this money is used for the purchase of weapons from other countries. The weapons are then transferred to rebel groups in Syria. \u201cQatar has also financed terrorists in northern Mali operations, including Ansar Dine, alleged to be linked to al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb [North Africa], says MacEoin.\n\nQatar\u2019s long history with terrorism funding starts from the very top: the royal family, according to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. A friend of the royal family in Qatar, the 61-year-old hardline businessperson and professor Abd al-Rahman al-Nuaymi, was designated a global terrorist by the U.S. in December 2013. Nuaymi is a Qatari who lives and operates in Qatar. The U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on him and declared him a \"Qatar-based terrorist financier and facilitator who has provided money and material support and conveyed communications to al-Qaeda and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen for more than a decade.\"\n\nRelated: Al-Qaeda-Affiliated Group Claims Mali Hotel Attack\n\nNuaymi was transferring $2 million a month to al-Qaeda in Iraq. He also sent roughly $576,000 to Abu Khalid al-Suri, al-Qaeda's Syrian representative, and $250,000 to the Somali jihadist group, al-Shabaab. He funded Asbat al-Ansar, a Lebanese terrorist group associated with al-Qaeda that was blacklisted in 2001. Nuaymi is still a free man in Qatar. \u201cDoha refuses to arrest him, a choice that speaks volumes about its priorities on terror finance,\u201d says David Andrew Weinberg, a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nView photo .\n\nPresident Obama hosts a working session of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) at Camp David in Maryland May 14, 2015.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nIn July 2008, Washington sanctioned Qatari national Khalifa Mohammed Turki Subaiy, a senior official of Qatar\u2019s Central Bank, on terror finance charges. The Treasury Department said that Subaiy provided financial support to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the 9/11 mastermind and al-Qaeda\u2019s senior leadership in Pakistan, served as a diplomatic and communications conduit for the group in the Middle East, and helped move new al-Qaeda recruits to South Asia.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council added Subaiy to its al-Qaeda blacklist in October 2008. This obligated member states to freeze his financial assets. But Subaiy found a way around the sanctions. Two Jordanians with Qatari ID cards worked with Subaiy in 2012 to transfer hundreds of thousands of dollars to al-Qaeda and its senior leaders in Pakistan. They were sanctioned by the U.S. two years later. Today, Subaiy and other econo-terrorists are living freely among the residents in Qatar who have not been prosecuted under Qatari law.\n\nIn testimony to the 9/11 Commission and Congress, Jamal al-Fadl, Osama bin Laden\u2019s former business aid who defected to the United States in 1996, said that Bin Laden told him in 1993 that the Qatar Charitable Society (QCS), later called Qatar Charity, was one of Bin Laden\u2019s major sources of funding.\n\nRelated: Al-Qaeda Claims French Attack, Derides Paris Rally\n\nFadl also said that QCS\u2019s director at the time was a fellow member of al-Qaeda who provided travel documents and funds, including paying fighters in Eritrea and providing $20,000 for an attack out of Sudan. In 2008, an interagency U.S. task force described Qatar Charity as a \u201cterrorism support entity.\u201d\n\n\u201cQatar Charity has acted as a financier and agency for terrorist outfits in several countries. It has funded al-Qaeda in Chechnya, Mali and elsewhere, was a key player in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and funded Syria's Ahfad al-Rasul Brigade,\u201d adds MacEoin.\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi Yousef\n\n\u201cAl-Qaeda operative Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) moved to Qatar in 1993 at the suggestion of its Minister of Islamic Affairs and Endowments, Abdullah bin Khalid bin Hamad Al Thani, a prominent member of the royal family and a first cousin of the emir. KSM wired money from Qatar to his nephew Ramzi Yousef to be used in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. KSM also planned al-Qaeda\u2019s 1994-95 \u201cOperation Bojinka\u201d to blow up airliners from the Philippines.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials, including former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke said that Al Thani was transferring both his personal money and ministry money to al-Qaeda and that he harbored other al-Qaeda leaders as they passed through Qatar, providing them with lodging, false documents, and other services.\n\nThe U.S. wanted Qatar\u2019s permission to arrest KSM. When the U.S. was granted that permission in early 1996, he was no longer in the country. American intelligence officials believed that Al Thani had tipped off KSM. Al Thani was promoted to Minister of State for Internal Affairs that same year. In 2001, he was promoted again to Interior Minister and remained in that position until 2013.\n\nQatar Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was responsible for brokering the deal among Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey last May to support the Syrian rebels and al-Nusra, who have been fighting both Assad in Syria and ISIS. The agreement took place on the eve of a meeting between Arab leaders and President Obama to discuss Syria and stability in the Middle East. At its worst, the deal reflects opposition by a strong Sunni coalition against Iran, Assad, and a potential Russian supported Shia alliance. At its best, the Qatar deal gives the U.S. a chance to reassess its failed support of the Syrian rebel fighters and redirect resources to a ground force that can win against ISIS.\n\nWho that may be is still a question.", "Kirby Smart recruits for Georgia, coaches Alabama ahead of playoff": "DALLAS \u2013 If you want to know what kind of hand Kirby Smart believes he's been dealt at Georgia, ask him what his recruiting pitch has been since the Alabama defensive coordinator was named head coach of the Bulldogs earlier this month.\n\nThe answer he gave to me Monday: \"Do you want to play?

After being immersed in the championship culture at Alabama since 2007, Smart should have a very good idea what kind of talent it will take to win it all. And seems pretty sure that the Georgia roster needs an immediate upgrade.\n\nThe tricky part is that Smart is delivering that \"Let's go\" pitch while still working for Nick Saban at Alabama. He's not the full-time head coach at Georgia until the Tide's season is over \u2013 whether it ends here against Michigan State in the Cotton Bowl on New Year's Eve, or in the College Football Playoff championship game in Glendale, Ariz., on Jan. 11.\n\nThe college football calendar creates these awkward arrangements. Late November and early December are when coaches get hired, but bowl games are played later than that. And now the playoff stretches all the way to the second Monday in January. View gallery . Kirby Smart was introduced as Georgia's new head football coach on Monday, Dec. 7. (AP)\n\nEvery year, job-hopping coaches are faced with dilemmas: go to the new school immediately, or see it through at the old school before moving on. When little is at stake, the easy answer is to go immediately \u2013 which is why bowl season is rife with interim coaches and skeleton staffs. But when your old team is playing for something like a national championship, there are no easy answers.\n\nIt's been done both ways.\n\nOffensive coordinator David Cutcliffe left Tennessee for Mississippi before the 1998 BCS championship game, and the Volunteers still won the title. Same with Gerry DiNardo at Colorado back in 1990, who went to Vanderbilt before the Buffaloes won half a national championship, splitting it with Georgia Tech. (For the kids who don't remember the days of polls declaring champions: It was a complicated time.)\n\nMore recently, Urban Meyer kept Dan Mullen and Tom Herman long enough as offensive coordinators at Florida and Ohio State to win it all before they left for head-coaching gigs. And Saban had a similar situation with offensive coordinator Jim McElwain just four years ago, when he stayed on through the BCS championship game before heading to Colorado State.\n\nBut it's easier to hang on to a guy headed to Houston or Colorado State than a guy headed to Georgia \u2013 they recruit from far different pools in terms of geography and talent. In the amount of time it took Smart to agree to a deal at his alma mater, he went from being Saban's right-hand man to a major recruiting rival.\n\nWhile primarily trying to devote himself to helping Alabama win yet another national title, those recruiting battles have already begun.\n\nLinebacker Ben Davis, a five-star recruit considered by many the top prospect in the state of Alabama, announced earlier this month that Georgia is his top school. That's despite the fact that his dad, Wayne, is the all-time leading tackler at Alabama. The guy who was listed as his primary recruiter for the Crimson Tide: Kirby Smart.\n\nThere could be a Saban-Smart battle brewing for another linebacker from Alabama, Lyndell Wilson of Montgomery. And Smart will be trying to keep Georgia prospects like defensive tackle Derrick Brown of Sugar Hill at home, after previously trying to get Brown to leave the state for Tuscaloosa.\n\nSmart said the conflicts are \"not as much as you might think. For four or five kids, maybe, we're those kids' top two schools.\"\n\nView gallery . Kirby Smart runs drills with Alabama defensive players during a practice on Monday, Dec. 21. (AP)\n\nAt the very least, it has been a sleep-deprived few weeks for Smart, trying to get up early and handle Georgia business before devoting a normal workday day to Alabama business.\n\n\"One day at a time, brother,\" Smart said. \"There's light at the end of the tunnel, I keep telling myself. I want to do the right thing by both employers. To not coach in this game, I could not imagine. I had players come to me and say, 'I appreciate it. You didn't have to do this.' \"\n\nIn figuring out how to wear two hats at once, Smart sought counsel of his former Alabama colleague McElwain, but more significantly Atlanta Falcons head coach Dan Quinn. Last year Quinn was the defensive coordinator of the Seattle Seahawks, who stayed with the team through its Super Bowl run before heading to Atlanta. Quinn's advice could be more applicable due to the length of the NFL season for Super Bowl teams, and subsequent compression of the offseason schedule at the next job.\n\nBut here's the big difference: staying at the old job brings instant recruiting credibility for Smart. He's trying to sell rings and titles, at a place that has a history of falling short in those areas.\n\n\"There's nothing that's going to help me more at the University of Georgia,\" Smart said, \"than winning a national championship at the University of Alabama.\"\n\nPopular college football video on Yahoo Sports:", "Y usted, \u00bfha so\u00f1ado alguna vez con este hombre?": "(Foto: www.thisman.org)\n\n\u201cHe tenido este sue\u00f1o recurrente por algunos a\u00f1os.

Seldom, it seems, are the candidates who rail loudest against interlopers the ones whose ancestors walked off the Mayflower.\n\nWhat is unusual, though, is to turn on a presidential debate and see two notably young Latino candidates, both born to Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s, jockeying over who will close the border faster and more securely. That was the scene in Las Vegas Tuesday night, and it underscored a central paradox of this year\u2019s Republican contest: Both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio seem like decent bets now to become the first Latino nominee in either party\u2019s long history, at exactly the moment when anti-immigrant fervor is reaching its zenith.\n\nWhich tells you something about the singularity of the Cuban-American experience, but maybe also about some of the nuance we tend to overlook in the immigration debate.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to see Cruz and Rubio as politicians cast from the same mold and reflecting remarkably similar stories. Here are two 44-year-old conservative Cuban-Americans, both lightning fast from mind to mouth, both first-term senators who capitalized on voter rebellion \u2014 Rubio in 2010, Cruz two years later \u2014 to shock establishment-backed opponents. The parallels are kind of bizarre.\n\nBoth men, eyeing the presidency from the moment they arrived in Washington, also wrote readable, if thoroughly forgettable, political memoirs with the kind of anodyne titles that make you think there must be some publishing algorithm for coming up with this stuff: \u201cA Time for Truth\u201d in Cruz\u2019s case, \u201c An American Son\u201d in Rubio\u2019s.\n\nBut if you read through those accounts (I have, mostly, so you don\u2019t really need to), you can see a subtle yet defining difference in each man\u2019s out-of-Cuba narrative, which probably has a lot to do with making them very different kinds of politicians.\n\nCruz\u2019s father fled political repression and existential danger as an ally of communist rebels seeking to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. Once in America, Rafael Cruz grew disillusioned with Fidel Castro and threw communism overboard, replacing it with a new guiding cause: evangelical Christianity.\n\nRubio\u2019s dad, on the other hand, came to America chiefly in pursuit of economic opportunity. In Florida and then in Nevada, and then back in Florida again, Mario Rubio\u2019s passion was to provide for his family, running small, ill-fated businesses (a vegetable stand, a dry cleaner) and tending bar.\n\nPoliticians, of course, have a tendency to reverse-engineer their memoirs, creating stories that neatly support their campaign themes; it can be hard to tell whether their experiences forged their worldviews or the other way around. Even so, in both of these immigrant stories, you can detect the roots of different political personas.\n\nCruz\u2019s Cuban story is all about zealotry and purity \u2014 a journey of faith, both political and religious. The boyhood chapters of Rubio\u2019s memoir, on the other hand, are largely about paying bills and fitting in, as generations of immigrants have tried to do \u2014 playing football and celebrating American holidays, switching churches (Catholic and Mormon) in order to adapt to social circles.\n\nRead More", "Where to sell back your unwanted video games": "View photo . Credit: Getty Images\n\nPoor Aunt Myrtle. She tried. She really did. But despite her best efforts, there's just no way you can work up excitement over Just Dance 2016 when you were hoping for Just Cause 3.\n\nThe goood news? Once she has toddled back to Cleveland and you don't have to worry about hurting her feelings, you have plenty of options when it comes to getting rid of the game and getting what you really wanted for Christmas.\n\nOf course, in the best of all worlds, your present came with a gift receipt, letting you return it with little to no hassle. But if not, there are still a number of different ways to get cash or credit for that unwanted title. Getting the most take a little work, though.\n\nGameStop: Still worth it?\n\nWhen it comes to game trade-ins, GameStop is the big fish in the slightly-larger-than-it-was-a-few-years-ago-but-still-pretty-small pond. You can get cash for your old games, but it's a sucker's bet. The smarter play \u2014 assuming you intend to purchase another game at some point \u2014 is taking store credit.\n\nTo get the most credit, though, you'll need to complete two steps. First, spend the $15 to join the store\u2019s PowerUp Rewards program (you'll also get a subscription to Game Informer magazine, so it's not lost money). Then, scan the store circulars and online ads, along with the forums of deal-centric websites like CheapAssGamer.\n\nPowerUp Rewards members get more for their trades, sometimes several dollars per title. And in the post-holiday period, GameStop typically offers extra in-store credits for hot titles. Get rid of some biggies and you can potentially earn nearly double the credit you normally would.\n\nCurious about how much you'll actually receive for your title? GameStop lists what it offers for hot titles and hardware.\n\nGreat deals at other retailers\n\nCompetition has driven up the trade value of several titles. Many big box retailers that sell games also accept trades-ins as well. The good news with these outlets is you can also easily see who's paying what (for in store credit, as none offer cash) before you bring your games in. Just head to the websites of WalMart. Best Buy, and Target to get a pretty reliable estimate.\n\nAs an added bonus, you can also use the credit you get for games for any items sold at those stores, so if you're in need of a spare controller \u2014 or even a new TV \u2014 those unwanted games can help offset the cost.\n\nIf you're a little more patient on when you actually receive the credit, Amazon's trade-in program is an option worth considering. The service is pretty straightforward: Enter the titles you want to dispose of on the site and you\u2019ll see their trade value. Assuming that\u2019s acceptable to you, you print out a free shipping label, box them up, and drop them off at the nearest UPS location. A week or so later, your Amazon account will receive a credit in that amount \u2014 which, as with the brick and mortar kings, you can use on anything \\ the site carries.\n\nAnother delayed gratification option is eBay. And, frankly, if you're looking for cash, this is your best bet. You have the ability to set minimum pricing and can even dictate the terms of payment. The risks, of course, include failing to find a buyer or being forced to accept a bid for an amount lower than you were hoping for.\n\nSo who's paying what? Prices vary frequently, so you'll need to do your homework. Here, however, is a look at what a few retailers were paying out for a handful of hot titles one week before Christmas:\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops III (PS4)\n\nGameStop: $20 cash/$25 credit ($22/$27.50 for PowerUp Rewards members)\n\nWalMart: $25.59\n\nBest Buy: $27\n\nTarget: $25\n\nAmazon: $23.77\n\nFallout 4 (PS4)\n\nGameStop: $20 cash/$25 credit ($22/$27.50 for PowerUp Rewards members)\n\nWalMart: $30.55\n\nBest Buy: $29\n\nTarget: $25\n\nAmazon: $26.55\n\nSuper Smash Bros.

Throughout the years, the company has gone from winning championships to pulling out of motorsports altogether on multiple occasions. The latest give-and-take came last year after Dodge and SRT Racing won the now Weathertech Sportscar Championship with the latest generation of Dodge Viper GT3 cars, then promptly left the race series just three days after the team accepted the trophy.\n\nIn a similar occurrence, Dodge\u2019s and Chrysler\u2019s predilection for wafting and wavering in motorsport almost quelled a racing great\u2019s entire career. According to Hemmings, in 1972, a young Dale Earnhardt was ready to give up racing for good. He had had enough of the racing world, and was ready to just get up and leave without looking back. That is, until Chrysler tapped the young driver to test a \u201ckit car.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Check out the latest creation from the Richard Petty Garage\n\n\u201cAs lore has it,\u201d explains the Hemmings article, \u201cDale Earnhardt was just about ready to hang up his helmet in 1974 and turn his back on racing for good when he got the opportunity to test a factory-built kit car Chrysler was developing. Encouragement from the Chrysler engineer on hand led Earnhardt to reconsider and go on to race professionally.\u201d While the late Earnhardt is now considered one of racing\u2019s great drivers, at the time, he was just a new driver. However, what made this encounter even more memorable was the car Earnhardt tested.\n\nIn 1972, Chrysler had once again left the racing world. The company was at the top of its game, and had a huge supply of racing knowledge that it could have tapped and returned triumphant. However, like the Viper\u2019s mentioned earlier, the company just decided to leave. In the interim, the company had decided to develop a short course racecar that customers could buy from the factory. Essentially, Chrysler was developing a Porsche Cayman GT4.R in the 1970s.\n\nRELATED: See images of the 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo \u201cIntimidator\u201d Edition\n\nEarnhardt was brought in onto the program in 1974, and tested Chrysler\u2019s prototype kit car. Later dubbed \u201cSaturday Night Specials\u201d by Richard Petty\u2019s company Petty Enterprises, the kit cars came either fully assembled, or in pieces for the owner to build themselves and customize. While if you selected to build the car yourself, you had the ability to drop any engine you conceived of into the engine bay, if you bought the car from Chrysler fully-assembled, it featured the company\u2019s \u201cW2 Head\u201d 355ci V8 that made 650 horsepower.\n\nHere\u2019s where it becomes truly interesting. When the Saturday Night Specials were introduced, the only body shapes you could buy were a Dart, a Valiant Scamp, and a Duster. Only 130 cars were sold, 30 full-assembled and 100 kits. However, there was at least one prototype that was built using a Challenger exterior, and to tie in Earnhardt, the original prototype that he tested had a Challenger body. Now a Challenger-bodied Saturday Night Special is coming up for sale and it could be the car that convinced Earnhardt to stay.\n\nRELATED: See images of the Petty Garage Ford Mustang King Edition\n\nThe Challenger-bodied Saturday Night Special will be heading to Mecum\u2019s Kissimmee auction this upcoming January. While no one has been able to properly trace this car\u2019s provenance, it\u2019s very likely that this is that same car that helped convince a racing legend to continue to race.\n\nDue to the incomplete provenance, the car\u2019s pre-auction estimate is between $40,000 and $80,000, which, if ever proven accurate, would be an absolute steal.", "The Top 25 Baseball Stories of 2015 \u2014 #20: David Ortiz announces that the 2016 season will be his last": "We\u2019re a few short days away from 2016 so it\u2019s a good time to look back at the top 25 baseball stories of 2015. Some of them took place on the field, some of them off the field and some of them were creatures of social media, fan chatter and the like. No matter where the story broke, however, these were the stories baseball fans were talking about most this past year.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox of the past 15 years or so have had no shortage of superstars, but when the story of their three World Series championships between 2004 and 2013 is told, David Ortiz is now and always will be the star of the show. This coming season will be his curtain call, however, as he announced his retirement, a year in advance, in mid-November.\n\nOrtiz started slowly in 2015 and, at 39, you never know when a slow start is more than just a slow start. Ortiz showed that he still had quite a bit left in the tank, however, finishing the year with a .273 batting average, 37 homers, 37 doubles, 77 walks, and a .913 OPS in 146 games. Ortiz also joined the 500-homer club late in the season.\n\nOrtiz may not be as productive in 2016 \u2014 eventually all players decline \u2014 but even if he isn\u2019t, it will be a year of farewells and retrospectives. As was the case with Derek Jeter, concerns about any present ineffectiveness will, most likely, be eclipsed by nostalgia. With Ortiz there is quite a bit of nostalgia to go around. Red Sox baseball of the past 15 years is unthinkable without Ortiz, both for his on-the-field exploits and his larger than life personality and leadership of both his team and his community.\n\nThere will likewise be a lot of debate about his Hall of Fame case. From this writer\u2019s perspective, Ortiz is a no-brainer Hall of Famer. To date he\u2019s a career .284/.378/.547 hitter. He has 503 homers and 1,641 RBI. His OPS is .925 and his OPS+ is 139. These numbers place Ortiz comfortably within the range of current Hall of Famers. Indeed, there are many worse hitters than Ortiz in Cooperstown whose primary argument for induction was their offensive output. And that\u2019s before you get to the \u201cfame\u201d arguments, which clearly favor Ortiz\u2019s induction. Some will deduct points because Ortiz is a designated hitter. This is lunacy, of course, as there have already been DHs inducted to the Hall of Fame and, more to the point, DH will have been an established position in baseball for nearly a half century by the time Ortiz is eligible for induction.\n\nThat\u2019s an argument for another day, however. For now, we prepare for our farewells to Big Papi.\n\nFollow @craigcalcaterra", "Top 10 games of 2015 (Puck Daddy Year in Hockey)": "(Puck Daddy presents its annual look back at the year in hockey.

Not only did they play in important games, a lot of their contests were hotly contested and wildly entertaining.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing in April, May and June all eyes are on you,\u201d former Blackhawks forward Patrick Sharp said in a recent interview with Puck Daddy.\n\nBelow are the top 10 games of 2015.\n\n10. The 2015 Winter Classic (Jan. 1)\n\nThe Washington Capitals beat the Chicago Blackhawks 3-2 in a tightly-played game between the two teams. Caps forward Troy Brouwer fired the game-winner with 12.9 seconds left in front of 42,832 fans at Nationals Park. Cold, dry weather led to solid ice conditions and better gameplay. The only problem during the game was a bright glare, that led to Caps defenseman Karl Alzner wearing sunglasses.\n\n9. Nashville Predators at Los Angeles Kings (Jan. 3)\n\nThe Los Angeles Kings were down 5-1 and 6-3 in a home game against the Nashville Predators, but stormed back in the final two minutes, on goals by Dwight King, Marian Gaborik and Jeff Carter, to force overtime. The Predators won the game 7-6 on a Roman Josi score 18 seconds into the extra session.\n\n8. New York Rangers at New York Islanders (Feb. 16)\n\nBoth teams combined for 85 shots on goal in a rocking Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum. It wasn\u2019t the final game between the two teams at the building, but it was the most memorable of the 2014-15 season. The Islanders held a 5-3 lead after Ryan Strome\u2019s goal at the 3:43 mark of the third period. New York fired three unanswered goals, punctuated by Kevin Klein\u2019s game-winner at the 15:28 mark to give the team a 6-5 victory.\n\n7. Boston Bruins at Ottawa Senators (March 19)\n\nThe Ottawa Senators were in the midst of their unexpected march to the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, and broke a 4-4 tie with two third period goals, a score midway through the frame by Bobby Ryan and an empty netter by Kyle Turris, to beat the Bruins 6-4. This pulled the Sens to within two points of Boston for the postseason. After the game, hamburgers were thrown on the ice in honor of Ottawa goaltender Andrew \u2018Hamburglar\u2019 Hammond, whose heroics helped spark Ottawa\u2019s run to the playoffs.\n\n6. Team Canada erases WJC frustrations with gold medal win against Russia (Jan. 5)\n\nCanada built a 5-1 lead over Russia in the WJC championship game, and held on for a 5-4 victory, ending the country\u2019s gold medal drought that dated back to 2009. The win helped ease the pain of Canada\u2019s 2011 loss where they blew a 3-0 third period lead to Russia in the WJC championship. Max Domi scored one goal and added two assists and teammate Anthony Duclair scored a goal.\n\nView gallery .

Tampa Bay Lightning at Chicago Blackhawks, Game 3, Stanley Cup Final (June 9)\n\nBefore Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final, Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender Ben Bishop was questionable with a mystery ailment. But he gutted out a 36-save performance in a 3-2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks to give the upstart Lightning a surprising 2-1 series lead. Bishop missed Game 4 and after the series the issue was disclosed as a torn groin.\n\n4. Chicago Blackhawks at Nashville Predators, Game 1, Western Conference quarterfinal (April 15)\n\nBlackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith started his Conn Smythe candidacy by saving a breakaway goal and scoring the game-winner in the double-OT thriller, a 4-3 Blackhawks win. Chicago was down 3-0 after the first period, but came back thanks to the heroics of then little-known backup Scott Darling who stopped all 42 shots on goal he faced in relief of struggling Corey Crawford. The victory gave the Blackhawks an early upper hand in their first round series against Nashville and began their push to the team\u2019s third Stanley Cup since 2010.\n\n3. Boston Blades vs. Montreal Stars in Clarkson Cup Final (March 7)\n\nJanine Weber fired the game-winning goal at 2:12 of overtime past goaltender Charline Labonte to give Boston their second Clarkson Cup title in three CWHL seasons in a 3-2 victory. Both teams traded goals in the third period to eventually send the game to overtime. Labonte was named the MVP and top goaltender, making 25 saves for Montreal.\n\nView gallery .

Chicago Blackhawks at Anaheim Ducks, Game 2, Western Conference final (May 19)\n\nAfter Corey Perry scored at the 17:30 mark of the second period to tie the game at 2-2, both teams went a long time without another goal, until Chicago\u2019s Marcus Kruger punched home a goal off a Brent Seabrook shot late in the third overtime for a 3-2 win.

(AP) -- The Miami Dolphins' latest loss prompted the wife of cornerback Brent Grimes to blast quarterback Ryan Tannehill on Twitter, further souring a disappointing season.\n\nMiko Grimes, who has 10,000 Twitter followers, is known for her strong opinions and profane postings, and has criticized Tannehill before. But her reaction to Sunday's 18-12 loss to Indianapolis was particularly vehement.\n\n''How many people does ryan tannehill have to get fired before you realize he's the problem,'' she wrote. ''Yall do realize no legitimate coach will come here if he's our qb, right? we're screwed as long as he's under center! just admit it!''\n\nThe rant is one more sign this season can't end soon enough for the Dolphins (5-10). They've lost three games in a row and are assured of finishing last in the AFC East for the first time since 2007.\n\nInterim coach Dan Campbell managed a smile when asked about the tweets.\n\n''This is not the first time that these things have happened,'' Campbell said. ''You can't listen to all that stuff out there.''\n\nView gallery Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill (17) looks to pass during the first half of an NFL footbal \u2026\n\nPlayers are off until Wednesday. Campbell declined to say whether he discussed the matter with Brent Grimes, but said he's not concerned about the relationship between Grimes and Tannehill.\n\n''I've never sensed that there has been any animosity or disconnect between those two guys,'' Campbell said. ''That has never been an issue, and I still don't believe it's an issue. ...\n\n''Everybody is entitled to their own opinion. Certainly my wife sometimes thinks different than I do. She has that right.''\n\nBrent Grimes is 32 and has struggled this season, raising doubts as to whether the team will bring him back next year. His wife's tweets could make the Dolphins' decision easier.\n\nMiko Grimes was well-known in South Florida even before she was arrested at the stadium before a game in September. Police said she disobeyed an officer's command to stop, was combative even after being handcuffed and head-butted an officer.\n\nView gallery FILE - In this Dec. 27, 2015, file photo, Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill looks to pass du \u2026\n\nTannehill is 28-35 as a starter and has yet to take Miami to the playoffs in his four NFL seasons. His first two offensive coordinators and head coach Joe Philbin were indeed fired.\n\nBut Miko Grimes' remarks seemed a mite harsh given the beating Tannehill took against the Colts. Working behind an injury-riddled line, he was sacked six times, including on Miami's final play when rookie center Jamil Douglas botched the snapped to end a comeback bid.\n\nTannehill limped badly in the final minutes, and his left leg was wrapped afterward. Since 2012 he has been sacked more than any other quarterback, including 44 times this year to tie for the league lead, but hasn't missed a start in his career.\n\n''He's one of the toughest guys, and especially quarterbacks, that I've been around,'' linebacker Kelvin Sheppard said. ''That guy has taken a number of hits this year, and every time he gets up. I'll take my hat off to Ryan.''\n\nFollowing Sunday's loss, Tannehill was asked if he's frustrated about ongoing protection issues.\n\nView gallery Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill (17) is sacked by Indianapolis Colts outside linebacker Ro \u2026\n\n''It's frustrating not winning,'' he said. ''I could care less about getting hit if we're winning, you know? It's not easy to win when the quarterback is getting hit, so that's something we want to fix.''\n\nIt probably won't get fixed before Sunday, when the Dolphins close out their season against AFC East champion New England. Miami can play the role of spoiler, because the Patriots are trying to clinch the No. 1 overall seed in the conference playoffs.\n\nThe Dolphins have no plans to shut Tannehill down, Campbell said.\n\n''If he can go, he's going to go,'' the coach said. ''My gut tells me he should be ready to go.''\n\n---\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL\n\n---\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine.

O'Toole was 78.\n\nThe team said O'Toole died Saturday at his home, a day after celebrating Christmas with his large family.\n\nThe lefty started the opening game of the 1961 World Series, losing to Yankees ace Whitey Ford 2-0. He also lost Game 4 to Ford, as a New York team featuring Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris and Yogi Berra won the series in five games. O'Toole gave up four earned runs over 12 innings.\n\nHe was the National League's starting pitcher in the 1963 All-Star Game. O'Toole called that one of his proudest career moments, recalling that manager Alvin Dark chose him to start with a roster that included future Hall of Fame pitchers Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Juan Marichal and Warren Spahn.\n\nO'Toole debuted at age 21 for the Reds late in the 1958 season and was 98-84 over 10 seasons, finishing with the White Sox in 1967. He was 19-9 in 1961 and twice won 17 games.\n\nA Chicago native, O'Toole and wife Betty Jane Wall, his high school sweetheart, adopted Cincinnati as their hometown, where they raised 11 children. He remained active in mingling with Reds fans, supporting charities and participating in local events such as Cincinnati's 2015 St. Patrick's Day parade, serving as the grand marshal.\n\nThe Reds Hall of Fame and Museum's site called O'Toole ''a fixture at Reds events of all types and sizes throughout his post-playing career.'' The site's remembrance said O'Toole enjoyed Cincinnati's tradition of making opening day a celebration and won two of three starts for the Reds in their season openers.\n\n''No day was more special to Jim and his expansive family than Opening Day,'' it said.\n\nO'Toole was inducted into the Reds' team Hall of Fame in 1970.\n\nNo information was available immediately on funeral plans.\n\n---\n\nFollow Dan Sewell at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell", "Hot Stove: Reds should consider trading Joey Votto as part of rebuild": "The Reds are currently in the middle of a massive rebuilding process. If there was any lingering doubt, it was crushed by the Todd Frazier and Aroldis Chapman trades this month. Cincinnati is focusing on the future, not the present.\n\nThe tear down phase of a rebuild can be quite ugly, and, frankly, the realization a lot of losing is in the near future can't be a fun experience for both fans and the team. Rebuilds are necessary -- especially for small market teams like the Reds -- but also unpleasant. Everyone wants to win.\n\nWith the Reds fully committed to tearing things down, the team should now look to trade the ultra-productive Joey Votto. The 32-year-old hit .314/.459/.541 (174 OPS+) with 29 home runs in 2015, earning him a third place finish in the NL MVP voting.\n\nVotto would undoubtedly be a major boost for several contenders. The Cardinals and Blue Jays immediately jump to mind. St. Louis is looking to add offense and Votto would give them a big middle of the order bat. The Blue Jays have offense to spare, but Justin Smoak and Chris Colabello are no obstacle at first base. Votto is from Toronto and would give the team another offensive building block with Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion a year away from free agency.\n\nOf course, trading Votto is much easier said than done. For starters, there's his monster contract, which will pay him $199 million over the next nine years. Not every team can afford that, and among the teams that can afford it, why wouldn't they just sign Chris Davis instead? Votto's a better hitter but Davis figures to be cheaper, and you get to keep your prospects.\n\nThere's also the issue of Votto's no-trade clause. He has full no-trade protection thanks to his contract, and few weeks ago he said he very much enjoys being with the Reds and has no desire to leave despite the rebuild. From MLB.com's Mark Sheldon:\n\n\"I absolutely love playing here,\" Votto said during Redsfest on Friday. \"When all this trade stuff gets going, it's natural for a player to have that thought process and what would you consider? I just absolutely love playing here. I really like where I live. I like my team and my job. I like the location of the ballpark and the fans and the clubhouse and the uniform and the number on my back -- all the littlest things that people take for granted are very comfortable to me and something I look forward to. I don't think of myself as anything other than a Cincinnati Red. It's one of the really cool things about having a no-trade clause. I'm one of the rare players who has that. I get to stay a Cincinnati Red. \"I look at guys in all kinds of different sports and I admire the players that stick with one franchise and do well and ride out the rough times and experience the highs, instead of it being the kind of experience that you consume.\"\n\nVotto doesn't exactly sound eager to leave Cincinnati, so it's entirely possible the idea of trading him is a waste of time. He won't accept a trade and that's that. It's also possible Votto may change his mind at some point, after a few weeks or seasons of constant losing in the rough NL Central.\n\nThere is no place for half-measures in a rebuild for a small market team like the Reds. If you're going to rebuild, you have to full commit and tear it all down if you want to turn things around as quickly and as best as possible. To Cincinnati's credit, they've done that. Trading Frazier couldn't have been easy.\n\nThat's why the front office needs to at least explore trading Votto. Gauge the market, see what kind of interest there is, and run it by him. Who knows, maybe playing at home in Toronto or for the contending Cardinals appeals to Votto and he decides to agree to a trade. It doesn't cost the Reds anything to look into it.\n\nVotto's a truly great player, but the Reds don't need an over-30 first baseman making huge money during their rebuild. Trying to trade him now, while he's still immensely productive, is the best move for the franchise going forward.", "6 Ways to Protect Your Home From the Coming Foreclosure Crisis": "Think the mortgage foreclosure crisis is long over? Think again. A legacy of the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the problem of financially pressed Americans losing their homes wasn't solved -- only deferred.\n\nMany public and private temporary relief measures will expire in 2016, likely triggering a new wave of home repossessions. This scenario is only one of many dangers lurking for investors in the new year. Below, we show you six ways to protect your home from foreclosure.\n\nTo be sure, eight years after the mortgage crisis initially emerged, foreclosures are down. At the peak in 2010, nearly 3 million homes experienced foreclosure filings in 2010; in 2013, the number was down to 1.1 million.\n\nBut that's about to change. Notably, home equity lines of credit that homeowners took out during the prerecession \"go-go\" years (when homeowners routinely used their homes as ATM machines) will start to feature increased payments in 2016, as borrowers are forced to pay back principal instead of merely the interest.\n\nMust Read: 5 Breakout Socks to Trade for Gains\n\nIf your bank is trying to squeeze you from your home, consider these options:\n\n1) Carefully Scrutinize All Information\n\nTake nothing for granted; trust no one; assume nothing. That means you should closely read all documents you receive from your lender or trustee. Put a magnifying glass to the fine print. If you don't understand something, don't be embarrassed -- some contracts are purposefully confusing to allow/prevent certain loopholes. Ask your lender to explain specifically what you're agreeing to. And remember, no one can ever force you to sign something. If you feel uncomfortable, ask to speak with your lender's manager.\n\n2) See if a Payment Will Extricate You\n\nDetermine how much money it would cost you to stop the foreclosure. If there's an amount of money that would stave off foreclosure, then pay it. Get a precise total, as to the entire amount of back payments and charges. Don't lose your home over a single back payment that you can scrounge together.", "Carey scores 2 TDs, Bears beat Bucs 26-21": "How bad is AJ McCarron's wrist injury? And will Andy Dalton be back to start the playoffs? Get caught up on all today's big stories with today's top 5.\n\nMarc Istook and MJD discuss what to expect of the upcoming matchup between the Oakland Raiders and the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nNFL Media's Brian Baldinger breaks down Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters' rookie season and the impact he has had on the team's defense.\n\nNFL Media's Charley Casserly and Brian Baldinger join \"Around The NFL\" to debate who should be the Denver Broncos quarterback in the postseason.\n\nThe odds are surely stacking against them but if these nine scenarios happen, the Colts just may find themselves in the AFC Playoffs.\n\nThe Colts can get into the playoffs if what?!\n\nChicago Bears safety Harold Jones-Quartey was able to record an interception, 1 forced fumble and 2 passes defended against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 16.\n\nThe Colts can get into the playoffs if what?!\n\nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Chicago Bears are determined to prove a losing record isn't the best indicator of what kind of team they're going to be in the future.\n\nRunning back Ka'Deem Carey delivered a glimpse of what he might be able to contribute moving forward, rushing for one touchdown and catching a pass for another Sunday to help the Bears stop a three-game losing streak with a 26-21 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nRebounding from a disappointing performance in a 21-point loss to Minnesota, the Bears (6-9) surpassed their victory total for a year ago to create some momentum heading into next week's season finale against Detroit.\n\nCoach John Fox, hired after Marc Trestman was fired following a 5-11 finish in 2014, is confident the team's headed in the right direction.\n\n''We feel it; those guys feel it. We're getting there,'' Fox said. ''We need to improve. They know it, but they're still trying to finish this year well. We've got one more game to try to avoid a double-digit losing season.''\n\nCarey caught a 1-yard TD pass from Jay Cutler, and the third-string running back also scored on a 1-yard run while teaming with Matt Forte and Jeremy Langford to spearhead a rushing attack that gained 174 yards and kept Tampa Bay's Jameis Winston off the field for long stretches.\n\nThe victory was only the second in the past six games for the Bears. Tampa Bay has lost four of five, including three straight after rebounding from a slow start to climb into contention for a wild-card playoff berth.\n\n''We've just got to bounce back. It's the NFL. Sometimes this stuff happens,'' Winston said of the tough stretch that ensures the Bucs (6-9) will finish with a losing record for the fifth straight season.\n\n''Obviously we don't want it to happen to us, but it happened. We have to be accountable,'' the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL draft said. ''And every one of those games, it's our fault. You can pick two or three plays to say: 'This could have changed the game.' That's what this game comes down to. ... If you want to be a great team, you've got to make every single play count.''\n\nWinston completed 15 of 29 passes for 295 yards with one costly interception. He threw for two TDs, including a 43-yard Hail Mary toss to Austin Seferian-Jenkins with one second remaining.\n\nCutler was 20 of 27 for 156 yards, one TD and no interceptions. Robbie Gould kicked first-half field goals of 26 and 27 yards, then added a couple of long ones - 49 and 50 yards - after Tampa Bay took the lead early in the second half.\n\nThe Bears, meanwhile, forced three turnovers - one of them Harold Jones-Quartey's goal-line interception - and limited Pro Bowl running back Doug Martin to 49 yards rushing on 17 attempts.\n\n''We had a lot of reasons to play well. We practiced well. I thought we were prepared,'' said Bucs coach Lovie Smith, who also feels his team is better than it has performed during its late-season skid.\n\n''We're disappointed. What it says about our team is if you turn the ball over and you make a couple critical mistakes on the other end, you have an outcome like that,'' Smith added. ''This is a better football team. Today we didn't play our best ball.''\n\nBoth teams were eliminated from playoff contention last week, but want to use the final two games of the season to learn about young players and set the tone for next year.\n\nOne of Tampa Bay's goals also is to try to help Martin win the NFL rushing title. The fourth-year pro entered day as the league's second-leading rusher, 9 yards behind Adrian Peterson.\n\nMartin scored on a 4-yard run set up by a blocked punt, but the Bears outrushed the Bucs 95-40 and controlled the ball for just over 20 minutes in building a 13-7 halftime lead.\n\nWinston then handed off to Martin five consecutive times before finishing a six-play, 78-yard touchdown drive with a sideline throw to Charles Sims that the running back turned into a 50-yard scoring play to put the Bucs ahead 14-13.\n\nNOTES: Langford rushed for 83 yards on 19 carries, Forte had 54 yards on 11 attempts, and Carey carried seven times for 16 yards. ... Smith lost for the second straight season to Chicago, the team he coached for nine seasons from 2004 to 2012. The Bears won three division titles and appeared in two NFC championship games and one Super Bowl under him. ... The Bucs forced zero turnovers. They have one takeaway in the past five games.\n\n---\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL", "Snapchat, Jessica Alba could put sexy back in the IPO market": "Welcome to the silly season of initial public offerings, that slow news, end-of-year, holiday-infused time to speculate about which companies might hit the stock market in 2016.\n\n\n\nThe number one name on the tip of every speculator's tongue is millennial messaging sensation Snapchat. The popular app, with over 100 million users at last count, said back in May that it planned to go public sooner or later and has since been hiring the kind of seasoned financial types that are needed to make that happen.\n\n\n\nConveniently, a Snapchat IPO could be just what the tech IPO market needs to snap out of its doldrums. By some measures, 2015 has been the slowest market for tech companies going public since 2009. And with half of the deals that did get underwritten now trading below their IPO price -- hello, Etsy (ETSY) -- there has been little holiday cheer to go around. The fast-growing, well-known, sexy L.A. company might be able to lift the gloom with a big deal that trades well. Then again, some said that about Square (SQ)... and Tinder (MTCH) ...and Box (BOX).\n\n\n\nOther big names getting bandied about include Jessica Alba's organic diaper purveyor The Honest Company, glasses seller Warby Parker, and audio hardware maker Sonos.\n\n\n\nBut, again, it's too soon to know whether any of these relatively famous names will crack the 2016 IPO rolls. A lot will depend on the stock market. Most already public tech companies had a mediocre year or worse and, as noted, recently public companies have done even worse. A little euphoria and higher valuations would do wonders to attract more of the big names.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, CB Insights has been tracking the universe of private companies and finds over 500 that may be getting close to going public. The firm's list includes some of the well known companies mentioned above, though not Snapchat.\n\n\n\n\"That'd be a surprise, to be honest, for 2016,\" says Anand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights. \"Most of the names we're seeing are enterprise or b2b focused.\"\n\n\n\nAmong the most likely candidates, according to Sanwal's firm, are less in the public eye and more focused on making other businesses run, like Actifio. The Waltham, Mass., company offers cloud file storage services to corporations like Dell and Time Warner. Another likely IPO-er is Okta. Its cloud service enables employees at companies like Del Monte and MGM Resorts to sign into all corporate services through a single cloud-based sign-on, making life simpler and more secure, at least in theory.\n\n\n\nA few tech companies have recently filed IPOs, making them among the most likely to go public early in the new year. Nutanix, which makes storage systems, wants to raise $200 million according to a Dec. 22 filing. And Dell unit Secureworks filed for a spin-off IPO worth $100 million on Dec. 17.\n\n\n\nAnd what about the real big game? The Ubers, the AirBnbs, the Xiaomis? All are valued in the tens of billions of dollars by their venture capital backers. None seem exactly eager to go public. But in the silly season, all speculation is fair game.\n\nAnd no company trades on a U.S. exchange under the ticker symbol \"SNAP\" or \"U\" -- at least not yet.", "2015 Reviews: Roush Fenway Racing": "View photo .\n\nDrivers (standings in parenthesis): Greg Biffle (20th), Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (25th), Trevor Bayne (29th)\n\nHighlights: Biffle led the team with three top-five finishes and four top 10s. Stenhouse Jr. had one top five and three top 10s while Bayne had two top 10s.\n\nBiffle's best finish came at Charlotte in the Coca-Cola 600, where he finished second to Carl Edwards. He also finished fifth at Pocono in August and fourth at New Hampshire in the fall.\n\nStenhouse Jr.'s best finish was at Bristol in the spring where he was fourth. Bayne, the straggler of the group, finished ninth at Michigan and Daytona in the summer.\n\nLowlights: While Biffle had those three top-10 finishes, they were products of strategy plays and not outright speed. The 600 was a race decided on pit strategy. Edwards won because he was stretching his fuel. And Biffle did the same at New Hampshire in the fall.\n\nBayne and Stenhouse each had 11 finishes of 30th or worse. Consistency wasn't a strong point. Stenhouse had two stretches with three-straight races of finishes of 34th or worse. Bayne had back-to-back 40th-place finishes at Indianapolis and Pocono.\n\nOverview: We are left to wonder more if this is the beginning of the new normal for Roush Fenway Racing rather than if the team will bounce back. Performance has deteriorated in recent memory as drivers like Matt Kenseth and Carl Edwards have left the team. Their departures aren't a coincidence when it relates to the lack of speed, is it?\n\nBiffle was head-and-shoulders above his two teammates in 2015, though he was still playing catchup to the rest of the field. Stenhouse showed flashes that he could hang with Biffle at times but didn't keep it up.\n\nThe team will have an alliance with Front Row Motorsports in 2016, though FRM wasn't too far behind Roush at times in 2015. Will the alliance benefit both parties? Roush certainly hopes so. When you look at the standings, it was the No. 3 Ford team behind Team Penske and Richard Petty Motorsports, which gets equipment from Roush.\n\nPrevious Reviews: JTG-Daugherty Racing and Germain Racing, HScott Motorsports, Front Row Motorsports, BK Racing and Tommy Baldwin Racing.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nNick Bromberg is the editor of From The Marbles on Yahoo Sports.

''We're a really good team obviously but there's a lot of other good teams. Sometimes we make it look like we're the only good team on the floor.

The heavily favored Stars and Islanders should receive plenty of love, but lineup possibilities are nearly endless with a lot of fantasy-friendly teams on the docket. This list of players should provide a guideline for how to stay ahead of the competition without feeling cash-strapped heading into your final few picks.\n\n[Play Yahoo's New Year's Eve bowl contest where everyone takes home at least a $1]\n\nGOALIE\n\n\n\nKeith Kinkaid, NJ vs. CAR ($31) - Kinkaid has been solid in a small sample size, accruing a .901 save percentage while giving up just 16 goals in seven games this season. A home date against a subpar Hurricanes team that averages just 2.36 goals per game offers an opportunity for him to improve on those already impressive stats. At just $31, playing the backup netminder lets you spend big elsewhere while limiting downside against a poor offensive team.\n\n\n\nGoalie to Avoid:\n\n\n\nJhonas Enroth, LA at EDM ($32) - Enroth has combined for just 21.5 fantasy points while going 0-3-0 in his last four starts. It would be unwise to expect a sudden turnaround from Los Angeles' backup against an Oilers team that is 7-4-1 in December.\n\n\n\nCENTER\n\n\n\nRyan Spooner, BOS vs. OTT ($16) - Spooner has three goals and seven assists in his last 10 games despite being held pointless in his last four, and he has a chance to build even further on those stats due to his ascension to the second line following David Krejci's upper-body injury. Projected Ottawa starter Craig Anderson has allowed the most goals in the NHL, so Spooner couldn't have picked a much better time to debut in a top-six role for the high-powered Bruins offense.\n\n\n\nCenter to Avoid:\n\n\n\nRyan Johansen, CLS vs. DAL ($18) - Johansen is a talented scorer, yet he somehow still hasn't found the back of the net through 12 games in December. Considering he owns a minus-6 rating this season, things could get ugly for the slumping Johansen against the top team in the NHL.\n\n\n\nWING\n\n\n\nMichael Grabner, TOR vs. NYI ($16) - Grabner exacted some revenge on his former team with a goal in Sunday's meeting at Barclays Center and should once again be motivated to deliver during their rematch in Toronto. The speedy winger has begun to atone for an excruciatingly slow start to the season with four goals, two assists and a plus-5 rating in his last five games, so get him in your lineups before his price jumps due to his recent production.\n\n\n\nCorey Perry, ANH at CGY ($21) - Despite having a pedestrian season by his own lofty standards, Perry managed two goals and an assist in his only previous meeting with Calgary, and has three goals in his last two contests overall. While the former Rocket Richard Trophy winner may not be what he once was, it's hard to ignore a streaking Perry when he can be had for just $21 in a cupcake matchup. Even though the Flames have been better lately, they still rank comfortably last in the NHL with 3.29 goals allowed per game.\n\n\n\nWings to Avoid:\n\n\n\nMilan Lucic, LA at EDM ($16) - Lucic's move to a line with Anze Kopitar was supposed to spark the Slovenian center, but instead it cooled the previously hot winger. The former Bruin has combined for -3.0 fantasy points in his last three games and should probably be avoided until he proves he can produce without Jeff Carter.\n\n\n\nAndrew Ladd, WPG at DET ($19) - Ladd did not take kindly to a temporary demotion to the third line for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Rangers on Dec. 18, as he has averaged just 2.0 fantasy points per game in three contests since reclaiming his usual spot in the lineup. Considering he preceded that game with a four-game pointless streak, Winnipeg's slumping captain is best left on the bench.\n\n\n\nDEFENSEMEN\n\n\n\nKevin Shattenkirk, STL vs. NSH ($22) - Shattenkirk is on pace to outproduce all but a handful of defensemen with his power-play production alone, as he already has 13 points with the man advantage in just 28 games. Nashville's surprisingly ineffective penalty kill has sunk all the way to 29th in the NHL, so it would almost be surprising if Shattenkirk didn't pad his impressive power-play point total in this contest. The talented blue-liner's 15 shots on goal over the past four games indicate he has been looking for his offense even more than usual recently, and there's a good chance he'll be rewarded for his efforts against a familiar divisional foe.\n\n\n\nP.K. Subban, MON at FLA ($19) - Montreal's top defensemen should be expected to bring his best effort with the division lead on the line, and he will have plenty of opportunities to accrue fantasy points considering coach Michel Therrien has given him more than 29 minutes of playing time in each of the Canadiens' last two games heading into this pivotal contest. It doesn't hurt that Subban has owned the Panthers to the tune of 12 points and a plus-5 rating in 19 career games against Florida.\n\n\n\nDefensemen to Avoid:\n\n\n\nKris Russell, CGY vs. ANH ($22) - Russell is pointless since Dec. 17 and makes for a head-scratching play considering his more productive defense partner, Dougie Hamilton ($21), is cheaper, while red-hot teammate Mark Giordano ($26) can be had for just $4 more. Thus, Russell is redundant even if you're a big believer in the Flames on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nJacob Trouba, WPG vs. DET ($16) - Trouba isn't a sexy fantasy play, as his value stems primarily from blocked shots. That type of resume leads to consistent production (Trouba has 2.0 to 6.o fantasy points in seven of the last eight games), but his upside ultimately isn't high enough to warrant consideration in daily formats outside of the most extenuating of circumstances.\n\n\n\nGet a FREE RotoWire 10-day trial (no credit card required) at RotoWire.com\n\nMORE FROM YAHOO HOCKEY:", "DeMarcus Cousins making difference during holidays and beyond": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 \u201cSanta Cuz\u201d took his time checking out presents, autographing purple T-shirts, taking selfies and having heartfelt conversations among the 100 underprivileged children from the Sacramento area whom he had treated to a Christmas shopping spree.

DeMarcus Cousins at his 'Santa Cuz Shopping Spree.' (Courtesy of the Sacramento Kings)\n\nCousins was born in the blue-collar city of Mobile, Ala., on Aug. 13, 1990. Cousins\u2019 mother, Monique Cousins, was a single mom who raised two boys and four girls. She also was a practical nurse who would often be creative with her work schedule in hopes of accommodating the daily needs of her children.\n\nDeMarcus Cousins said that while his mom did her best to make ends meet, the family still struggled financially. He felt lucky if he got one of the presents on his Christmas wish list, but he was always grateful for whatever he received.\n\n\u201cMy memories of Christmas, it was more about being around family,\u201d Cousins told Yahoo Sports. \u201cWe weren\u2019t the most fortunate family growing up. My mom did what she could and I was grateful for whatever it was. \u2026 At Christmas you were hoping for this and that. At the same time, as a kid I knew what our situation was. I understood.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d go back to school and your friends would say, \u2018What you get for Christmas?\u2019 You got to make up a lie. \u2018I got this, this and this.\u2019 It\u2019s all part of growing up and everyone has a different story. It made me who I am today. I know what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, Cousins developed the \u201cSanta Cuz\u201d holiday persona in an effort to help the community. The 6-foot-11, 270-pounder actually dressed up like Santa Claus the first two years, but this time he wore a Kings purple Santa hat during the $20,000 shopping spree at Arden Fair Mall on Dec. 14. The 2015 All-Star gave each of the children \u2013 who ranged from elementary school age to high school \u2013 $200 gift certificates to buy Christmas presents. Most appeared to use the gift cards for presents not only for themselves but for their family members as well.\n\n\u201cChristmas is a financial strain on most families. I am going to do my part,\u201d Cousins told Yahoo Sports.\n\nOne boy who reminded Cousins of himself made a particularly strong impression.\n\n\u201cHe had six brothers and sisters,\u201d Cousins told Yahoo Sports. \u201c[His mother] raised them all on her own. He said, \u2018I got my mom a bracelet to show my appreciation for her for raising the kids.\u2019 That was the same thing for me. My mom raised six kids on her own. The first thing I got my mom when I got some money was a house.\n\n\u201cIt kind of touched me and hit home for me.

Cousins also purchased over $75,000 in Kings season tickets that were donated to local school and non-profit organizations.\n\nCousins donated $20,000 for a recent Christmas shopping spree hosted by his mother in Mobile. He also paid for the funeral of Sacramento Grant High School football player Jaulon Clavo, a 17-year-old who was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting in November. Cousins also welcomed Clavo\u2019s mom, sister and cousin into the locker room after a game.\n\n\u201cWhy do I do this? That is reality to me,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cExcuse my French, but this [expletive] that everybody feeds off with the whole basketball world, it\u2019s a fantasy and it\u2019s short-lived. The impact I have on [the Clavo] family is forever. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nCousins has built a reputation as arguably the NBA\u2019s top center due to his wide-ranging offensive talent. But he is also known as a tough guy and a fiery player who perhaps doesn\u2019t always express himself in the best way possible. Off the court, however, that isn\u2019t him.\n\n\u201cHe puts himself in a position to help kids because he\u2019s pretty much seen everything and been through it,\u201d said Phoenix Suns guard Eric Bledsoe, a close friend of Cousins\u2019 who played with him at Kentucky. \u201cWhen he sees a kid, he envisions himself when he was younger.

During an interview with Oklahoma radio station 107.7 The Franchise, Weeden was asked if it felt good to help lead the Texans to the playoffs in light of Jones' jab at him. He responded with a solid retort (via NFL.com's Conor Orr).\n\n\"Absolutely. We get to play extra football and he'll be watching on his couch. That's what it's all about.

In the short clip, Manziel, wearing a ''Merry Manziel'' shirt, is seen singing along as ''March Madness'' by Future plays in the background. A framed jersey of Tampa Bay's Mike Evans, one of Manziel's Texas A&M teammates, hangs on the wall behind him.\n\nLast month, Manziel was demoted from starter to third-string by Pettine after he denied that a video of him partying in Austin, Texas, was taken during Cleveland's bye week. Manziel had promised Pettine and other coaches he wouldn't be a distraction while the team was off.\n\nOn Monday, Pettine said he had not yet seen the new video of Manziel.\n\n''Any time there's something with our players that casts them potentially in a bad light, whether it's Johnny or any of our other guys, it's certainly a concern,'' Pettine said on a conference call. ''I'm sure I'll see it and have a discussion with him about it. These circumstances are different from the incident that occurred before. I'm just not going to go into a ton of detail with it until I get a little bit more information about it, but it's something that I'm sure privately we'll discuss if it needs to be discussed.''\n\nPettine had promised there would be ''harsh'' repercussions if Manziel had another embarrassing issue. The Browns have been supportive of the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner, who has shown major progress in his second NFL season following a rough rookie year which was followed by a 73-day stay in a rehab facility for an unspecified condition.\n\nView gallery Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel (2) balances a football before an NFL football game agai \u2026\n\nWhen he benched Manziel previously, Pettine said he was doing so because the 23-year-old had violated the team's trust.\n\nManziel was shot holding a champagne bottle in the video last month, and in the new one he appears to be holding an alcoholic beverage. Pettine was asked if he was troubled that Manziel would be so public with his drinking considering his past issues.\n\n''It falls back into not micromanaging personal lives, and it's very public unfortunately,'' said Pettine. ''The thing that's disappointing is how public it becomes and it's something with all of our players we're going to sit down with them before they get out of here and talk about where they are personally, where they are professionally, and certainly Johnny will be no exception.''\n\nManziel rushed for 108 yards - the most by a quarterback in team history - in Sunday's 17-13 loss at Kansas City.

But a recent round of dividend cuts has given some income-seekers a rude awakening. Among the rudest: Kinder Morgan (symbol KMI), the energy pipeline giant, slashed its dividend 75% in early December, cutting the quarterly payout from 51 cents a share to 12.5 cents. A day later, Freeport McMoRan (FCX), a copper and gold producer with an ill-timed expansion into oil and gas production in 2013, suspended its dividend.\n\nSee Also: 12 Stocks Paying Dividends for 100 Years or More\n\nDividend cuts are still rare. Through mid December, 337 companies in Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index increased their payouts this year. But the average increase is running at 13%, below the 18% average increase in 2014 and 20% in 2013. And 15 companies in the S&P decreased their dividends, while three, including the aforementioned Freeport, suspended them altogether, up from just eight cuts and no suspensions in 2014. Companies in the struggling energy sector cut dividends by $6.2 billion. For context, consider that from 2010 through 2014, cuts in the energy sector totaled $1.3 billion.\n\nHow to spot a risky dividend\n\nIronically, an indication that a cut is imminent is a spiking yield, which is a stock\u2019s annual dividend rate divided by its share price. What\u2019s \u201chigh\u201d in terms of yield depends on the industry; 4% for a utility stock is fine, but it invites skepticism in a faster-growing tech company or a more-economy-sensitive industrial company, for instance. But if a stock that usually yields 4% all of a sudden yields 6%, and the cause of that burgeoning yield is a falling share price, it could be an indication that Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the dividend is sustainable and that a reduction is in the offing.\n\nIt\u2019s best to be on the lookout for warning signs of a dividend cut early on, because by the time it\u2019s finally announced, much of the damage to a stock has already been done. Keep a close eye on a stock\u2019s payout ratio, or the amount of a company\u2019s earnings paid out in dividends. The average payout ratio for S&P 500 stocks is currently 37%. Again, what constitutes a high ratio depends on the business. Tobacco stocks can pay out the majority of their earnings in dividends because a long-term decline in demand for their product means they\u2019re not spending a lot on factories and equipment, yet the business remains profitable and generates tons of cash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in general, anything above 70% to 75% should raise eyebrows\u2014or at least initiate some research. Get to know the company\u2019s cash flow situation. While earnings can be subject to various adjustments, a positive free cash flow means a company has invested what it needs to maintain its business and has money left over to spend on dividends.\n\nLook at how much debt the company is carrying and whether it needs to tap capital markets to meet its commitments. Companies forced to choose between protecting their credit rating and protecting their dividend will cut the payout every time. \u201cThat\u2019s what forced the situation for Kinder,\u201d says Josh Peters, a stock strategist and editor of Morningstar Dividend Investor.\n\nStocks whose dividends might be in jeopardy\n\nWhose dividend is next on the chopping block? Reality Shares Advisors, a sponsor of exchange-traded funds, ranks dividend-paying stocks based on historic dividend trends, cash flow, earnings, buybacks and other data, with an eye toward determining the prospects for dividend hikes or cuts. Stocks with the company\u2019s lowest rating have about a 40% chance of cutting their dividends within the next 12 months. (You can find the ratings at www.realitysharesadvisors.com/divcon).\n\nWhether a dividend cut is a reason to sell depends on why you own the stock in the first place. What a bargain-hunter sees as a smart fiscal move to deal with a temporary setback could be a deal-killer for an income investor.

It also extended its regular-season home winning streak against Calgary to 21 games, which is tied for the second-longest in NHL history against a given opponent.\n\nThings have been more balanced in Calgary with the Ducks going 6-5-2 since the start of 2010-11, including splitting two playoff games last season. To get back to the postseason, though, both teams need to reach another level, and the Flames seem to be getting there.\n\nAnaheim (13-15-6) is beginning a three-game road trip against the Pacific's Canadian clubs, while Calgary (17-16-2) is hosting its third on a four-game homestand.\n\nSunday's 5-3 win over Edmonton established the club's record home span and has the Flames at 9-2-0 overall since the start of the month thanks to plenty of scoring. They've averaged 3.55 goals per game in December and 3.82 over the home dominance.\n\nJohnny Gaudreau and Mark Giordano both scored twice against the Oilers, giving Gaudreau five goals in two games and 12 with six assists this month.\n\n\"I think just altogether, including myself and throughout everyone in the locker room, I think we're playing a lot harder right now,\" Gaudreau told the team's official website. \"When you do that and do the little things right you find the net. I've got a couple squeaky ones that I was fortunate enough to get in the net. I've been shooting a little bit more and finding the net a little bit more.\"\n\nThe Flames have also started to play at least at a manageable level in their defensive zone.

Stephen Curry, who beat James in those Finals and is the league's reigning MVP, recently told Time magazine he believes he now wears that mantle. His Golden State Warriors teammates agree.\n\n\"He should believe that, and he is,\" Warriors forward Draymond Green told Yahoo Sports. \"I think the team agreed with that, and we're rolling with him.\"\n\nCurry did little to diminish that claim after helping lead the Warriors past James and the Cleveland Cavaliers 89-83 in their Christmas rematch of last season's Finals.\n\n\"He is a special player, a special talent, a special person more than anything, and I think it's great for our league,\" James said.\n\nCurry's old coach with the Warriors, ABC analyst Mark Jackson, however, declared during the network's telecast of Friday's game that the sharpshooting guard is \"hurting\" the sport of basketball.\n\n\"Understand what I'm saying when I say this. He's hurting the game,\" Jackson said. \"And what I mean by that is that I go into these high school gyms, I watch these kids, and the first thing they do is they run to the 3-point line. You are not Steph Curry. Work on the other aspects of the game.\"\n\nCurry chuckled at Jackson's comments but also seemed confused by them.\n\n\"I have to talk to him,\" Curry told Yahoo Sports. \"I don't know what he means by that. If you can shoot, shoot. If you can't, stop.\"\n\nWarriors center Andrew Bogut, who also played under Jackson, didn't appreciate his former coach's remarks.\n\n\"Anything he says, you can take that with a grain of salt,\" Bogut said. \"And you can quote me on that.\"\n\nIn addition to his electrifying play on the court, Curry's popularity also is helped by his family-guy image and his 6-foot-3 frame that gives smaller players hope they can someday reach the NBA. Sam Moses, an AAU coach and executive director of Oakland's mammoth basketball facility, Jam Town, calls Curry \"the perfect role model.\"\n\n\"He's clean cut, always with his family and very nice to his fans,\" Moses told Yahoo Sports.\n\nGreen thinks it is harder for children to aspire to become such a rare, athletic, physical player like the 6-foot-8, 250-pound James.\n\n\"It's good for kids to think they can be Steph because it gives them realistic hope,\" Green told Yahoo Sports.\n\nFor years, AAU programs in America have received a bad rap for not developing young players to have more fundamental skills the way Europeans do. But with Curry being such a phenomenal shooter and dribbler, Moses believes he can help to change that trend.\n\n\"The average kid now will work on having complete skill sets,\" Moses told Yahoo Sports. \"You don't have to be big, strong and super fast anymore. If a kid comes in and says they want to be like Steph, they talk about ball-handling more than his 3-ball. He gets to the basket more than the shoots 3-pointers. You would think kids just want to work on the long ball, but they're working on their dribbling.\"\n\nAAU Oakland Soldiers executive director Mark Olivier, who coached James in the program in high school, told Yahoo Sports that Curry inspires more kids to play basketball.\n\n\"Everyone can't be Steph, but the want can give them more drive and determination,\" Olivier said. \"Younger players want to improve their shot.\"\n\nCurry actually credits James for helping his rise to NBA stardom. During Curry's college career at Davidson, James helped mentor him.\n\n\"He kind of took me under his wing as a youngster when I was in college,\" Curry told Yahoo Sports. \"We obviously battle on the same court now. We have mutual respect for each other and it's hard for us to do what each of us does.\"\n\nGolden State now owns an NBA-best 28-1 record after its victory over Cleveland. The conversation has started on whether the Warriors can beak the 72-win record by the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls. If they do, Curry's legend will only grow.\n\nCurry \"is special, really special and we all know that,\" James said.", "CFA Institute \u2014 Does the United States have an ideal retirement...": "By Robert Stammers, CFA\n\nDoes the current retirement system in the United States help retirees amass enough assets to live off of for 20\u201330 years of retirement, or are its requirements and constraints hindering people from saving and investing effectively?\n\nIn a recent speech, President Obama said that he plans to help more states create retirement-savings programs for workers. A few states have already passed laws that require employers to open retirement plans for employees instead of waiting for employees to enroll in plans on their own.\n\nAs the federal and state governments attempt to improve our retirement system, one has to ask whether the United States currently has an ideal system and what can be done to strengthen it. Determining the best way forward can be challenging since retirement security spans government politics, employer practices, individual investor education, and cultural differences.\n\nI would like to highlight some suggestions from a recent report \u2014 An Ideal Retirement System \u2014 that CFA Institute commissioned from Mercer, a global retirement consulting leader, earlier this year. The report suggests 10 principles for an ideal retirement system.\n\nA few of the principles are relevant for retail investors:\n\n\u201cContributions to retirement accounts at the required minimum level must have immediate vesting. These benefits should be accessible only under certain conditions, such as retirement, death, or permanent disability.\u201d\n\nMany employers require workers to be employed with them for several years before employer contributions to retirement accounts are officially transferred to employees. But given that the average worker changes jobs every 4.4 years, there is a chance that some workers could depart before their benefits vest, leaving money on the table that could be worth thousands in retirement savings someday.\n\nA minimum level of funding should be put into a pension system for all workers, with contributions by employers, employees, and the self-employed, as well as for those of working age who are receiving certain forms of income replacement.\n\nIn effect, this means every worker will have a retirement account with an entitlement to future benefits.\n\nThere should be cost-effective and attractive default arrangements, both before and after retirement.\n\nThis is for individuals who do not wish to make decisions or don\u2019t feel comfortable making them.\n\nThere should be taxation support from the government in an equitable and sustainable way, providing incentives for voluntary savings and compensating individuals for the lack of access to their pension savings.\n\nInstead of annual contribution limits for retirement plans, there should be lifetime contribution limits to maximize contributions when possible. People do not reach the maximum amount of disposable income at the same time. For younger people, saving for a home or having children may affect their ability to contribute to their retirement account. For older people, health issues may siphon off money that could go to retirement accounts.\n\nSo, does the United States have an ideal retirement system, and how does it stack up against retirement systems in the rest of the world? According to the most recent Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index, it\u2019s average at best. The United States falls in the middle when compared with other countries and received a grade of C from the Index, meaning that the U.S. system has some good features, but also has major shortcomings that should be addressed. The United States falls well behind the top five leading countries: Denmark, Australia, the Netherlands, Finland, and Switzerland.\n\nMercer suggests that the overall index value for the U.S. system could be increased by\n\nRaising the minimum pension for low-income pensioners,\n\nAdjusting the level of mandatory contributions to increase the net replacement for median-income earners,\n\nImproving the vesting of benefits for all plan members and maintaining the real value of retained benefits until retirement,\n\nReducing pre-retirement leakage by further limiting the access to funds before retirement, and\n\nIntroducing a requirement that part of the retirement benefit must be taken as an income stream.\n\nWhile the federal and state governments consider improvements, it should be noted that investors, plan sponsors, and investment-management firms play just as important a role in improving the collective retirement security of U.S. citizens. Ultimately, though, the person who plays the biggest role in having a secure retirement is you.\n\nAll posts are the opinion of the author.

If the Fed raises rates as expected next year, the amount nearly doubles to $23.1 billion.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2015, the Fed purchased over $4 trillion worth of bonds to stimulate growth in the economy. Risk markets responded, as is demonstrated by the close correlation between the S&P 500 and growth of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet through its bond purchases.\n\nView gallery . Federal Reserve\n\nTo sterilize the vast sums of money that would otherwise circulate throughout the economy and cause price inflation, the Fed pays an above-market interest rate of 0.50% to banks on reserves, or digital cash, held at the Fed. Currently, banks are holding $2.5 trillion at the Fed and are paid $34.5 million per day in interest.\n\nThe Fed has telegraphed its intent to raise rates in 2016, and analysts expect two to four rate hikes. Assuming the Fed raises rates four times\u2011-once at each of the meetings that are accompanied by a press conference--payments to banks at the end of 2016 would amount to $103.6 million per day.\n\nIn addition to paying interest on reserves, the Fed conducts daily auctions to drain cash from the economy and maintain a floor on short-term interest rates. These reverse repo operations pay 0.25% and have averaged $154 billion per day since the Fed raised rates on December 16.\n\nThe interest paid by the Fed to banks and funds that participate in the operations amounts to $1.06 million per day. If the Fed raises rates as expected in 2016, total payments would be $1.03 billion in 2016, which is in addition to the $23.1 billion paid as interest on reserves.\n\nView gallery .

He was 54.\n\nPost-Dispatch sports editor Roger Hensley told The Associated Press that Strauss's wife called him early Sunday to say Strauss had died that day at a St. Louis hospital from complications related to leukemia.\n\nStrauss, who joined the newspaper in 2002, became a sports columnist in 2012. He previously wrote for the Baltimore Sun and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the Post-Dispatch reported (http://bit.ly/1Otu7fi ).\n\n''Joe was certainly capable of writing a column that would pull at your heartstrings, and did so on many occasions,'' Hensley said. ''But when it took a strong voice to deliver something Joe felt the readers and fans of our local teams needed to hear, he pulled no punches. Joe didn't dance around a touchy topic, he hit the hole. When you finished reading a Joe Strauss column, whether you agreed or not, there was no doubt you knew where he stood. And knowing Joe, there's no other way he would have it.\n\n''A beautiful writer, a hard-nosed reporter, an even-handed columnist, and more than all of that, a great friend,'' Hensley added. ''I will miss Joe immensely.''\n\nA native of Richmond, Virginia, Strauss attended the University of Dayton and graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1983, the same year he joined the Baseball Writers' Association of America.\n\nHis first newspaper job was with the Gwinnett Daily News in Georgia, where he was the newspaper's beat writer for the Atlanta Braves, Falcons, and the University of Georgia. He later became a national baseball writer and national writer for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and then joined the Baltimore Sun to cover the Orioles, including the end of Cal Ripken Jr.'s streak of consecutive games played.\n\nStrauss's death comes less than 13 months after Bryan Burwell, another sports columnist for the Post-Dispatch who was on an ESPN show, died in December 2014. The newspaper's film critic, Joe Williams, died in a car accident in July.\n\n''The deaths of Joe Strauss, sports columnist Bryan Burwell and movie critic Joe Williams in a little more than a year have taken an emotional toll on their families and their Post-Dispatch friends,'' Post-Dispatch editor Gilbert Bailon said.

They basically produce two outlooks, a medium term outlook to 2020 and a long term outlook to 2040. I found their medium term outlook pessimistic in some cases too optimistic in others. But I found their long term outlook to be wildly optimistic\u2026 in most cases.\n\nIn all cases below I chart crude when it is available and \u201cliquids\u201d only when no other option is available.

Notice the tremendous growth in \u201cOther Liquids\u201d, whatever that is.OPEC expects Non-OPEC crude to be down in 2016 but to begin a slow recovery in 2017. I think that outlook is way too optimistic.\n\nRelated: $10 Trillion Investment Needed To Avoid Massive Oil Price Spike Says OPEC\n\n\n\n\n\nView gallery .\n\nOPEC thinks their short term production has peaked and will decline by 100,000 barrels per day next year and hold on a flat plateau until sometime after 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nView gallery .\n\nAdding OPEC and Non-OPEC crude we see that OPEC thinks World crude production will decline next year but begin a slow increase starting in 2017. Also notice that OPEC\u2019s estimate of current crude production is well below what the EIA says is being produced and even below JODI\u2019s production numbers. I think this is because OPEC does not count Condensate. Other than that I do not have an explanation.\n\n\n\n\n\nView gallery .\n\nView gallery .\n\nView gallery .\n\nOPEC expects Russian liquids production to decline by 100,000 bpd next year and hold at that level for five years, or perhaps longer. They expect Russia to increase production by 200,000 bpd over the next 20 years.OPEC thinks China will peak next year, 100,000 bpd above the 2015 level. I think that is just a tad optimistic.I find OPEC extremely overoptimistic concerning Brazil. So does Petrobras. Petrobras\u2019 troubles highlight bleak prospects for Brazilian oil production to 2020\n\nThe analyst adds that Petrobras\u2019 recent revisions to its production plans, forecasting 2.8 MMbpd by 2020, 1.4 MMbpd less than 2014, will be adjusted further. This is due to more recent Petrobras CEO statements indicating less capital expenditure and a larger divestment strategy. One key change in the investment plan for pre-salt production has been a significant reduction in the number of FPSOs brought online by 2019.\n\nRelated: 5 Possible Surprises In Energy For 2016\n\n\n\nView gallery .\n\n\n\nIt is with the US and Canada where OPEC is most optimistic. They see US and Canada liquids production continuing onward and upward with not much of a pause.\n\n\n\n\n\nView gallery .\n\nOPEC expects light tight oil to increase in 2016. They only show a slight uptick in LTO in 2016 but an uptick nevertheless. I just don\u2019t believe that is possible. They actually pick U.S. LTO peak, 2023.\n\nTight crude production from the US plays increases from 3.8 mb/d in 2014 to about 4.9 mb/d by 2023. It declines slowly thereafter to 4.2 mb/d in 2040. While the Canadian plays are not as prominent as the US plays, they increase their tight crude production throughout the forecast timeframe from under 0.2 mb/d in 2014 to less than 0.5 mb/d by 2040.\n\n\n\nView gallery .\n\n\n\nHere we see the actual LTO production figures that OPEC is expecting. They have Light Tight Oil increasing by 100,000 barrels per day in 2016. They are saying the price collapse only slowed down the growth in LTO production and it will pick back up in 2017, though it will still be increasing at a much slower rate than in years past.\n\nRelated: Germany\u2019s Prospects For Energy Storage\n\n\n\n\n\nView gallery .\n\nOkay, if LTO has been responsible for the huge gains in the US and some in Canada, what does OPEC\u2019s production look like if we remove LTO from the picture. Well production just keeps on increasing\u2026 according to OPEC anyway.\n\nProduction just keeps increasing and increasing. Counting LTO the US and Canada peaks around 2025 but that is only because of the decline of LTO. The rest, which was declining before the advent of LTO, has now turned around and just keeps increasing into the far distant future.\n\nBut what about prices. Are not prices killing production in the oil patch, especially in the USA? Well the 2015 World Oil Outlook does not present any price charts or tables. But they do tell us what prices need to do in order for their reference case predictions to be fulfilled, all on page 8. Bold mine.\n\nIn this Outlook, the price of the ORB is assumed to average $55/b during 2015 and to resume an upward trend in both the medium- and long-term. The medium-term foresees a $5/b increase each year so that a level of $80/b (nominal) for the ORB is reached by 2020, reflecting a gradual improvement in market conditions as growing demand and slower than previously expected non-OPEC supply growth eliminate the existing oversupply and lead to a more balanced market. This, in turn, will provide support to prices. Translated into real prices, the oil price is assumed to be $70.7/b by 2020 (in 2014 prices).\n\nThe long-term price assumption is based on the estimated cost of supplying the marginal barrel which will gradually move to more expensive areas. This continues to be the major factor in the period through to 2040. The price of the ORB in real terms is assumed to rise from more than $70/b in 2020 (in 2014 prices) to $95/b in 2040 (in 2014 prices). Correspondingly, nominal prices reach $80/b in 2020, rising to almost $123/b by 2030 and more than $160/b by 2040. It should be noted that these are not price forecasts, but working assumptions to guide the development of the Reference Case scenario.\n\nThey are saying that if prices increase by $5 a barrel a year, from $55 a barrel that they assume will be the 2015 average, then all will be well after only a slight dip in production in 2016 and 2017. So in 2016 we should see prices averaging $60 a barrel if they get their \u201cReference Case\u201d started off on the right foot.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that they see Non-OPEC production peaking around 2025 but OPEC still increasing production, not just enough to offset the Non-OPEC decline, but enough to keep world oil production increasing through 2040.\n\n\n\n\n\nView gallery .\n\nJust one more chart with data from the EIA\u2019s latest Monthly Energy Review. The EIA Monthly Energy Review has November US C+C production at 9,181,000 barrels per day. That is 404,000 bpd below the peak in April 2015 of 9,585,000 bpd and just 7,000 bpd below the production of November 2014.\n\nU.S. production is clearly declining and that decline will, far more likely than not, accelerate in 2016. The point is that OPEC projection of U.S. crude oil production is clearly in error. It is just flat out wrong, no other way to say it. I know, the production numbers for 2016 are not in yet, but the chance that U.S. 2016 crude oil production numbers will be above the 2015 production numbers is slim to none.\n\nOPEC has tried to hedge their bets by combining U.S. production with Canadian production. But even that will not work. U.S. plus Canadian 2015 production, in my estimation, will clearly be above U.S. plus Canadian 2016 crude oil production.\n\nI may be wrong with this prognostication, but that remains to be seen.\n\nBy Ron Patterson\n\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:", "424 goals, 26 trophies: Mind-blowing Messi reaches 500 Barcelona games": "Lionel Messi is set to make his 500th appearance for Barcelona in all competitions when Luis Enrique's side take on Real Betis in La Liga on Wednesday.\n\nThe 28-year-old has enjoyed a stunning Camp Nou career since making his debut for the club in 2004 and is hoping to win a fifth Ballon d'Or crown next month.\n\nAhead of Messi reaching the milestone, here are 10 key stats from his Barcelona career to date, courtesy of Opta:\n\n- Messi's 499 Barcelona matches in all competitions have seen him score 424 goals, giving him an average of 0.85 goals per game.\n\n- Messi's best goalscoring season came in 2011-12.

It's become a rallying cry for the Redskins and their fans, who continued the chant for several minutes after the game.\n\n''We felt like we were an up-and-coming football team and could compete with anyone,'' coach Jay Gruden said.\n\nThe Redskins have won three straight for the first time since a seven-game winning streak helped them secure the division in 2012 in Robert Griffin III's rookie year.\n\nDeAngelo Hall returned DeMarco Murray's fumble 17 yards for a momentum-changing TD in the third quarter. Cousins threw TD passes to Chris Thompson and Pierre Garcon and a pair to Jordan Reed.\n\nThe Eagles (6-9) entered the game in control of their playoff hopes. They needed to beat the Redskins and Giants next week to win the East. Washington's win also eliminated New York (6-8).\n\n''I think we're good enough,'' Coach Chip Kelly said. ''We just have to put them in better position to make plays. It's 100 percent on my shoulders. It's unacceptable.''\n\nTwo teams have clinched division crowns in Philadelphia in six days. Arizona won the NFC West with a 40-17 win over the Eagles last Sunday night.\n\nWhile the Redskins head to the playoffs, the Eagles and Kelly face a challenging offseason. Kelly took control of personnel decisions last year and overhauled a team that went 10-6 in each of his first two seasons.\n\nIt clearly didn't work out.\n\nMeanwhile, Gruden made a gutsy call in August to bench Griffin and give the starting job to Cousins.\n\nIt paid off.\n\nCousins was outstanding down the stretch with 16 TD passes and only two interceptions in the last seven games. He showed resolve after a mental blunder at the end of the first half cost the Redskins at least three points.\n\nCousins took a knee with no time-outs and 6 seconds left from the Eagles 6 with a 16-10 lead. He realized his mistake and tried to spike the ball, but the clock ran out. He made up for it in the second half.\n\n''I'm very proud of Kirk,'' Gruden said. ''He came in and kept his composure just like he has all year. Put his nose to the grindstone.''\n\nCousins tossed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Thompson to give Washington a 23-10 lead. He converted three third-down passes on the series after Jaylen Watkins dropped an interception.\n\nThe Eagles answered quickly as Murray ran in from the 4 to cut it to 23-17.\n\nBut Murray then dropped a pitch, Hall picked it up and ran it back for a 30-17 lead late in the third quarter.\n\n''I can't take my eyes off it,'' Murray said. ''It was my fault.''\n\nThe Eagles missed a chance to take the lead early in the second quarter when Sam Bradford overthrew a wide-open Zach Ertz on third-and-9. It would've been a 60-yard TD.\n\nThey missed another opportunity on the following series when Nelson Agholor dropped a 28-yard TD pass and settled for Caleb Sturgis' 34-yard field goal that cut it to 13-10.\n\nAfter going three-and-out on their first possession, the Redskins scored touchdowns on the next two. Cousins connected with Reed over the middle on a 22-yard scoring pass to cut it to 7-6. Dustin Hopkins missed the extra point wide left.\n\nCousins then hit Reed over the middle again for a 12-yard TD pass and a 13-7 lead.\n\nNotes: Bradford had 380 yards passing. ... Reed had nine catches for 129 yards. .. Former Eagles Pro Bowl WR DeSean Jackson had four catches for 40 yards. ... The Redskins are 2-5 on the road, 3-12 in Gruden's two seasons.\n\n---\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL\n\n---\n\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP-RobMaaddi", "Interview confessions of a former recruiter: 5 things to avoid": "Time and time again, former recruiter Connie Thanasoulis-Cerrachio has seen job candidates get far along in the job application process just to fail during the interview round. Now as a career coach and co-founder of SixFigureStart, Thanasoulis-Cerrachio, who worked at Merrill Lynch, educates people on the mistakes to avoid in the job search and interview process. Here are some of her best pieces of advice.\n\n\n\n#1 Don\u2019t be overconfident and wing it\n\n\n\n\u201cRecruiters have a sixth sense of when candidates are winging it,\u201d says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio. If you\u2019ve made it far enough in the job process to land an interview, make every effort to prepare for it. Far too often, she\u2019s seen candidates who should\u2019ve snagged the job, but fail to do so because they were underprepared and overconfident.\n\n\n\n#2 Don\u2019t take the phone interview lightly\n\n\n\nA lot of recruiters will start the job interview process by screening candidates over the phone. Phone interviews are basically like open-book tests, says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to have all your notes in front of you, you just have to prepare and get those examples ready to go.\u201d And making a good impression over the phone will get you in front of them for the next round face-to-face.\n\n\n\n#3 Don\u2019t forget to focus on quantifiable results\n\n\n\nWhen sharing an example of your strengths and successes, lead with quantifiable results. Often candidates will begin by sharing one success story and jump to another before completing their first thought. \u201cInstead, if you\u2019ve increased revenue by 50%, lead with that statement and then go into the story because now you have my attention,\u201d says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio.\n\n\n\n#4 Don\u2019t just prepare responses to the tough questions\n\n\n\nBefore walking into an interview, most people will have answers prepared for the tough questions about their biggest strengths and weaknesses. But when employers ask, \u201cCan you walk me through your resume?\u201d you\u2019ll be surprised at how many people stumble, she says. The best way to answer this basic question is to be concise and to the point, as well as enthusiastic and positive about your accomplishments.\n\n\n\n#5 Don\u2019t be shy about how much you want the job\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a recruiter, I always want to hire the people that really want the job. If I\u2019m going to extend an offer, I want to know that you\u2019re going to accept,\u201d says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio. After expressing your interest, end the interview by letting your interviewer know how you can bring significant value to this role.\n\n\n\nHave a job-related questions?

It's time to reflect on the year that was and look ahead to what's on the horizon for 2016. As any degenerate gamer knows, fantasy football thoughts are always at the forefront. Monday's topic: Quarterback.\n\nEvery year, new lessons are learned. Subsequently, what New Year's resolution, player specific or in general, will you adhere to at QB in light of experiences gained this past fall?\n\nBrandon \u2013 Middle class of NFL quarterbacks has expanded so much that it makes no sense to draft a QB until the late, late rounds of your draft if you miss out on one of the few difference maker QBs early on - I'd say that elite group constitutes 6-7 signal callers head into '16, depending on how you feel about Andrew Luck. If you don't land one of those guys, you might as well stream the position, playing the match ups as you would with a defense.\n\nBrad \u2013 PLAY THE PATIENCE GAME. Full disclosure, I was the guy preaching to buy into the high floors of Andrew Luck and Aaron Rodgers back in August. Though steeped in logic, that advisement completely bombed. Next year, I'll aim for Blake Bortles, Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota, Ryan Fitzpatrick or a discounted Luck in the middle rounds.\n\nAndy \u2013 I knew this one already so it's kind of like cheating, but NEVER EVER NEVER EVER DRAFT A QUARTERBACK FIRST OVERALL. It never works out. Remember how Cam was a terrible selection just four months ago? And Bortles wasn't draft-worthy? And Ryan Fitzpatrick was a punchline. Well, fantasy managers who own those guys were competing for titles, and the Andrew Luck crowd was finished in Week 12.\n\nLiz \u2013 QUICKS. Five of the top ten most scoring fantasy QBs are also ranked among the top ten in terms of rushes. A signal caller\u2019s escapibility and willingness to scamper for first downs should be as big of a part of his fantasy profile as his weapons and arm strength.\n\nScott \u2013 I've been a wait-on-QB player for my entire fantasy run, but I'm becoming more open-minded to taking a second option if I see early upside. That sort of angle gets you to Blake Bortles this past year. And for the love of all things holy, let's try to make Superflex (or two-QB leagues) more of a common thing next year.\n\nDalton \u2013 Like always, just wait on this position. Even in a year in which almost no running backs panned out, taking a quarterback early still wasn't worth it. The safest players to draft were Andrew Luck and Aaron Rodgers (and even as a no QB early guy, I wouldn't have argued this). Go figure.\n\nWhat passing prospect, presumably set to enter the 2016 NFL Draft, are you most excited about?\n\nBrad \u2013 PAXTON LYNCH. Memphis product possesses plus arm strength, strong pocket poise and above average mobility, a Blake Bortles type. His 28:3 TD:INT split and 69.0 completion percentage are indicators he'll transition well. Landing spot is everything, but the probable top-15 overall pick is the best of the QB bunch.\n\nAndy \u2013 None. Pass. I'm good. I'll take one of the sophomore QBs, thanks. Let's revisit this question in a year, when we can discuss DeShaun Watson.\n\nLiz \u2013 PAXTON LYNCH. Accurate arm. Slick wheels. Baller name.\n\nScott \u2013 Rookies quarterbacks aren't my thing. As talented as Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota are, they barely made a ripple on the fantasy landscape. The 2012 crop isn't walking through that door. I'm not going to talk myself into anyone.\n\nDalton \u2013 Quarterback is ridiculously loaded, and I can't imagine a rookie coming from this class breaking the top-25 in year-end value, let alone being taken seriously in fantasy drafts.\n\nBrandon \u2013 PAXTON LYNCH, will bring questions to NFL as he played in spread system against mostly sub-par competition (at Memphis), but there is no question about his size and arm strength - they both easily check the NFL boxes. And despite his bigger frame, he's got plus mobility.\n\nThe Bold and the Disputable. Describe one nutty, but completely plausible, prediction at QB for the 2016 season.\n\nAndy \u2013 MATTHEW STAFFORD is a top-three fantasy QB next season. His physical traits are still off the charts, and his receiving corps is outstanding. When a new coach takes over (Adam Gase, maybe?), that offense is going to pop.\n\nLiz \u2013 DREW BREES and Sean Payton get sent to the Dolphins in a package deal next year. The Saints franchise QB finishes his career and begins retirement in sunny South Florida.\n\nScott \u2013 MARCUS MARIOTA doubles his rushing yardage and rushing touchdowns in his second season.\n\nDalton \u2013 KIRK COUSINS, who has a 73.2 completion percentage while getting 9.3 YPA and a 16:2 TD:INT ratio (with three rushing scores) over his last seven games, finishes as a top-five fantasy QB. He's continuing to improve, and imagine if DeSean Jackson and Jordan Reed happen to stay healthy.\n\nBrandon \u2013 RGIII is the opening week '16 starter for the Houston Texans.\n\nBrad \u2013 Provided Mike Evans undergoes that much needed hands transplant during the offseason, JAMEIS WINSTON takes a leap similar to Bortles in his sophomore season and cracks the QB top-10 in per game average. There's lots to like about Winston's situation -- average TB D, useful weapons, his willingness to call his own number near the goal-line.\n\nWhat quarterback will you vigorously chase in drafts next year? What round do you expect to acquire his services in 12-team drafts?\n\nLiz \u2013 NONE. I\u2019m not vigorously chasing QBs. If he\u2019s still on the board in the fifth round, however, I\u2019d happily roster AARON RODGERS.\n\nScott \u2013 I'm pretty cool on the position, but I'm curious to see what a sophomore MARCUS MARIOTA can do if the Titans locate a legitimate coach. And I'm also eager to see whay TYROD TAYLOR might be able to do with additional volume.\n\nDalton \u2013 Few are more agnostic about this position than I am. I'll let the draft room dictate whom I draft at QB, because I'm not taking one before round seven at the absolute earliest. I hope my guy KIRK COUSINS falls that late for some reason. But there will be plenty of alternatives if not.\n\nBrandon \u2013 BLAKE BORTLES. He should only get better in Year 3, perhaps even watchable. Great talent, great weapons, but still not completely respected in fantasy circles. I'll take him in any draft where he's still available after six QBs have come off the board - not sure which round that will typically be because QB draft flow is tough to predict.\n\nBrad \u2013 BLAKE BORTLES. Made noticeable strides across the board in Year 2 posting improvements in QB rating, TDs, INTs and YPA. With a pair of young and very talented wideouts (Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns), a useful tight end (Julius Thomas), respectable ground game and sketchy D, he's likely to finish inside the top-five in per game yet again. He'll be a bargain in Round 6/7 of 12-team drafts.\n\nAndy \u2013 DEREK CARR is my guy, and I bet I won't have to chase him too aggressively. He threw 30-plus TD passes at age-24, his receivers are beasts, and he's only going to improve. He's going to be dirt-cheap next season, yet his setup is excellent. Definitely a top-10 QB in 2016.\n\nList your QB top 16 for '16.\n\nScott \u2013 1) Ben Roethlisberger, 2) Andrew Luck, 3) Cam Newton, 4) Aaron Rodgers, 5) Russell Wilson, 6) Carson Palmer, 7) Tom Brady, 8) Drew Brees, 9) Andy Dalton, 10) Blake Bortles, 11) Tony Romo, 12) Derek Carr, 13) Matthew Stafford, 14) Kirk Cousins, 15) Eli Manning, 16) Marcus Mariota\n\nDalton \u2013 1) Ben Roethlisberger 2) Aaron Rodgers 3) Andrew Luck 4) Cam Newton 5) Russell Wilson 6) Tom Brady 7) Carson Palmer 8) Drew Brees 9) Blake Bortles 10) Kirk Cousins 11) Andy Dalton 12) Derek Carr 13) Matthew Stafford 14) Philip Rivers 15) Eli Manning 16) Marcus Mariota\n\nBrandon \u2013 1) Cam Newton, 2) Aaron Rodgers, 3) Ben Roethlisberger, 4) Tom Brady, 5) Russell Wilson, 6) Blake Bortles, 7) Carson Palmer, 8) Andrew Luck, 9) Drew Brees, 10) Tony Romo, 11) Derek Carr, 12) Andy Dalton, 13) Eli Manning, 14) Philip Rivers, 15) Matt Ryan, 16) Kirk Cousins\n\nBrad \u2013 1) Cam Newton, 2) Andrew Luck, 3) Big Ben, 4) Aaron Rodgers, 5) Blake Bortles, 6) Tom Brady, 7) Carson Palmer, 8) Russell Wilson, 9) Drew Brees, 10) Jameis Winston, 11) Matthew Stafford, 12) Tony Romo, 13) Andy Dalton, 14) Marcus Mariota 15) Derek Carr, 16) Kirk Cousins\n\nAndy \u2013 1) Cam, 2) Ben, 3) Rodgers, 4) Luck, 5) Brady, 6) Russell, 7) Palmer, 8) Brees, 9) Bortles, 10) Dalton, 11) Stafford, 12) Carr, 13) Eli, 14) Jameis, 15) Cousins, 16) Mariota.\n\nLiz \u2013 1) Ben Roethlisberger, 2) Aaron Rodgers, 3) Russell Wilson, 4) Cam Newton, 5) Tom Brady, 6) Blake Bortles, 7) Drew Brees, 8) Andrew Luck, 9) Andy Dalton, 10) Matthew Stafford, 11) Derek Carr, 12) Carson Palmer, 13) Eli Manning, 14) Kirk Cousins, 15) Jameis Winston, 16) Marcus Mariota\n\nWant to bull rush Brad?

(AP) -- Coach Mike McCarthy had a rough trip home to Green Bay, and it had nothing to do with the snowy weather.\n\nAfter the Packers watched film of their nightmarish game in Arizona, McCarthy moved on quickly to getting his players ready for a meeting this weekend against Minnesota.\n\nAt stake: the NFC North title and a home playoff game.\n\n''So we've had a long, bumpy flight home to grade the tape,'' McCarthy said Monday. ''Just really wanted to get in there and get the team focused on the Vikings.''\n\nForgetting about Arizona quickly might be the way to move forward for a team that failed the test in a 38-8 loss in the desert.

Rodgers accounted for three turnovers, including two fumbles off sacks that were returned for touchdowns.\n\n''We played the worst we can possibly play, and we're on to Minnesota,'' receiver James Jones said.\n\nGetting healthier up front would help. McCarthy said it was too early to tell how much left tackle David Bakhtiari and right tackle Bryan Bulaga, who each have ankle injuries, would be able to practice this week.\n\n''Well, the healthiest team gives you your best option to play on Sunday,'' McCarthy said.\n\nView gallery Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (12) is tackled by Arizona Cardinals defensive end Frost \u2026\n\nBut the Packers aren't using injuries as an excuse, either.

It starts from a protection unit, to a route-running detail, to catching the football. It's everyone, coaches included,'' offensive coordinator Edgar Bennett said.\n\nThe coaches aren't worried about the Packers' ability to bounce back.

Floyd Mayweather (L) and Oscar De La Hoya (C) certainly seem to enjoy taking jabs at each other. (Getty)\n\nAs perhaps the best ever to market himself, Mayweather knows what it takes to break records and create a buzz outside of the boxing world. Even if his fights rarely resulted in the fireworks that fans wanted, he always created an atmosphere in which viewers were compelled to tune in.\n\nBut now that he\u2019s gone, the sport has been scrambling to find its next big superstar. And as of right now, that star appears to be Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d Alvarez, whom Mayweather defeated in 2013 in one of the biggest PPV fights of all time. Although Canelo is a star, Mayweather isn\u2019t so sure he is being handled correctly by his promoter, who so happens to be former foe and nemesis Oscar De La Hoya.\n\n\u201cCanelo just came off a good, exciting victory against a future Hall of Famer, Miguel Cotto, but they're so fast to try and throw this guy right back in the lion's den with another guy that they say is one of the top fighters in boxing,\u201d Mayweather told FightHype.com. He was speaking about the potential September 2016 showdown between Canelo and Gennady \u201cGGG\u201d Golovkin that looms as the biggest fight that can be made right now. Mayweather knows a thing or two about big fights as his victory over Manny Pacquiao destroyed all records despite not living up to the hype.\n\nMayweather sees the potential in a Canelo-GGG showdown, but feels that the fight needs more time to simmer before it comes to fruition.\n\n\u201cWhy is the promoter rushing and trying to throw Canelo right back in there in another rough and tough fight?\u201d Mayweather said. \u201cIf they really care about your health and your well-being, if they really care about you and your family, which they don't, because I know \u2013 I've been in this sport forever, so I done seen how it works \u2013 but if they really care, me, as a promoter, I'd let that fight build.\u201d\n\nOne can argue that Mayweather is correct in his assessment because Mayweather-Pacquiao reached unbelievable levels of hype as it took half a decade to finally materialize. However, sometimes trying to take time to build a fight can result in everything backfiring with a surprising loss. But since it worked out fine for Mayweather, it\u2019s difficult to argue against him.\n\n\u201cIt's not about working harder; it's about working smarter,\u201d Mayweather said.", "Report: White Sox, Orioles \u201cemerging as leaders\u201d for Yoenis Cespedes": "We\u2019re a few short days away from 2016 so it\u2019s a good time to look back at the top 25 baseball stories of 2015. Some of them took place on the field, some of them off the field and some of them were creatures of social media, fan chatter and the like. No matter where the story broke, however, these were the stories baseball fans were talking about most this past year.\n\nAs I mentioned in the last entry, baseball tends toward incremental change. Sometimes, however, there\u2019s a single incident which serves as a watershed moment for the game, after which people simply think about long-accepted practices differently and which leads to change. We saw this a few years ago after Buster Posey\u2018s leg was broken in a collision at home plate, leading to new rules outlawing collisions with catchers. We likely saw another such moment when Chase Utley slid into Ruben Tejada during Game 2 of the 2015 NLDS.\n\nWith Enrique Hernandez on third base and Chase Utley on first and one out, Howie Kendrick hit a ground ball up the middle. Daniel Murphy, ranging to his right, corralled the ball and flipped to Tejada, who had to whip around to fire to first. Utley slid late and hard and took out Tejada, who couldn\u2019t make a throw. The Dodgers scored the tying run on the play. Tejada left the game with a broken leg, his season over. Utley\u2019s slide was clearly dirty. He didn\u2019t start his slide until he was parallel to the second base bag, and he never touched the base. His intent was clear: take out Tejada, never mind about reaching the bag.\n\nIn the wake of that play, momentum has built toward a rule change that will almost certainly be referred to as \u201cThe Chase Utley Rule\u201d when it is eventually adopted. It will likely be aimed at eliminating the sorts of hard slides into second base, the likes of which Chase Utley demonstrated. In reality, however, baseball already has a rule which could serve that purpose if it were ever enforced. It\u2019s Rule 6.05(m), which already says a baserunner is out when, in the umpire\u0092s judgment, he intentionally interfere with a fielder who is attempting to catch a thrown ball or to throw a ball in an attempt to complete any play. As the comments to the rule make clear, it is intended to outlaw \u201cdeliberate, unwarranted, unsportsmanlike action by the runner in leaving the baseline for the obvious purpose of crashing the pivot man on a double play, rather than trying to reach the base.\u201d\n\nWhy the league thinks it needs a new rule rather than simply enforcing an old one is unclear. Perhaps it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to allow umpires to exercise any judgment and, rather, would prefer to make some objective standard for such plays, even if the judging of a runner\u2019s intent is essential. Perhaps they just like the idea of a \u201cChase Utley Rule\u201d and don\u2019t want to use an old one for that.\n\nEither way: the legal takeout slide is an endangered species in Major League Baseball, thanks to Mr. Utley. And may soon be extinct.\n\nFollow @craigcalcaterra", "2015 Reviews: JTG-Daugherty Racing and Germain Racing": "Welcome to our 2015 reviews. Instead of going driver-by-driver we're going to review teams this year. We're starting from the bottom of the standings and working our way up. Let's pair up two single-car teams with Richard Childress Racing alliances.\n\n\n\nGermain Racing\n\nDriver (standings in parenthesis): Casey Mears (23rd)\n\n\n\nHighlights: Mears had one top-10 finish in 2015 and it came in the Daytona 500. He finished sixth and led a lap after starting 41st. Perhaps not-so-coincidentally, Daytona's summer race was his next-best effort. He finished 11th there in July.\n\nMears had 14 top-20 finishes and had a nice run during the summer. He had finishes of 16th and 13th at the first Pocono and Michigan races.\n\nLowlights: In between Michigan and the second Daytona race came Sonoma. And this mishap.\n\nMears finished 38th there. He also finished 42nd at Michigan in August and in the season finale at Homestead.\n\nOverview: Mears seems to have found a secure spot at Germain. The team has a Richard Childress Racing alliance and he had more consistent speed than drivers from bigger teams.\n\nBut unless Germain has more resources \u2013 and RCR becomes as fast as Hendrick Motorsports \u2013 this may be the ceiling for the team. A good start to breaking through the ceiling would be turning some of those top-20 finishes into top 10s.\n\nJTG-Daugherty Racing\n\nDriver (standings in parenthesis): AJ Allmendinger (22nd)\n\nHighlights: Allmendinger had three top-10 finishes in 2015. Two of them came in the first three races as he was seventh at Atlanta and sixth at Las Vegas. The two finishes, coupled with a 20th in the Daytona 500, meant Allmendinger was fifth in the points standings after four weeks.\n\nHis other top-10 finish came at Pocono in August. Allmendinger had two poles in 2015 and both of them came at the road courses.\n\nLowlights: Let's continue talking about the road courses. Allmendinger won at Watkins Glen in 2014 to make the Chase and after starting first at both Sonoma and Watkins Glen, was considered the heavy favorite at both tracks.\n\nNeither race went well at all. Allmendinger finished 37th at Sonoma and 24th at Watkins Glen. Without consistent Chase-level speed at ovals, he was helpless to qualify for the Chase for a second-straight season.\n\nOverview: Allmendinger signed a five-year extension with the team in May, so he's not going anywhere. However, there's nothing to indicate he'll be more than just a contender at Sonoma and Watkins Glen for the foreseeable future.\n\nAllmendinger may be one of the most talented drivers in the garage, and that talent is on display whenever there are right turns involved. But until the team has great equipment where speed and aerodynamics matter, Allmendinger will be reduced to vying for a Chase berth twice a year barring a restrictor plate miracle.\n\nPrevious Reviews: HScott Motorsports, Front Row Motorsports, BK Racing and Tommy Baldwin Racing.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nNick Bromberg is the editor of From The Marbles on Yahoo Sports.

It felt like it was timely and overdue to resurrect this story of these women who had fought this incredible battle and really changed the course of history.\u201d\n\nTHE STORY BEHIND \u2018SUFFRAGETTE\u2019\n\nAn extensive amount of research was required for all involved with the film. Morgan said, \u201cI started to realize there was this other level of suffrage amongst the working-class women. \u2026 When they went to riots and when they were arrested, they would come back and they\u2019d lose their jobs. So we suddenly realized this could be a very modern-day telling in a way of so many of the conditions that affected these women. It felt very resonant today.\u201d\n\nThe team behind Suffragette also faced many challenges during the six years it took for it to be made. \u201cOne was to convince everyone that we wanted to tell this story on a big landscape. We didn\u2019t want to just make a small art movie,\u201d said Owen. \u201cThey also wanted to tell the story of a suffragette like a Mrs. Banks suffragette and not the raw story of the working-class women.\u201d\n\nTHE CHARACTERS OF \u2018SUFFRAGETTE\u2019\n\nWhile the movie tells the story of a fictionalized, composite character, Maud, she interacts with historical figures in the U.K. women\u2019s suffrage movement, including Emmeline Pankhurst, played by Streep, and Emily Wilding Davison, played by Natalie Press.\n\nThe suffragettes followed a campaign of militant civil disobedience, believing \u201cdeeds, not words\u201d were the path to the vote. The women would engage in activities such as throwing rocks at storefront windows and damaging private property.\n\n\u2018SUFFRAGETTE\u2019: A MODERN TALE\n\nThough the movie captures the history of the suffrage movement, the filmmakers hope that the message and spirit of the film will be inspiring to women everywhere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a documentary about a time,\u201d said Mulligan. \u201cIt\u2019s not just saying, \u2018This happened and we owe them a great deal and that\u2019s brilliant.\u2019 It\u2019s saying, \u2018That happened and we do owe them, but look where we are now.\u2019 If you look globally, we have much farther to go. I hope it makes people feel empowered to speak up and do something.\u201d\n\nSuffragette is expanding nationwide throughout November.

(AP) -- Stephen Curry's eyes lit up when he saw little brother Seth guarding him for the first time in their NBA career, and the reigning MVP promptly missed a long 3-pointer.\n\n''It was a very cool moment,'' the Golden State star said. ''I missed and he let me know about it. After that I was able to see a couple go in.''\n\nThat's an understatement.\n\nCurry scored his first 17 points in the final 3:16 of the first half and went on to record his sixth career triple-double as the Warriors won for the 29th time in 30 games this season, 122-103 over the Sacramento Kings on Monday night.\n\n''He's done that so many times throughout the year, I don't think that's me, per se,'' Seth Curry said. ''He's going to turn it up. He's done that probably once a game, had a run like that. We tried to stop him from getting going, but it's tough. The game was going so fast at that time, that's when he's at his best.''\n\nCurry had 23 points, a career-high 14 rebounds and 10 assists, Klay Thompson scored 29 and Draymond Green had 25 points for the Warriors, who have won 33 straight regular-season home games.\n\nOmri Casspi scored a career-high 36 points, tying Mike Bibby's team record with nine 3-pointers for Sacramento.\n\nBut star center DeMarcus Cousins got ejected in the third quarter and the Kings lost their 11th straight against their Northern California rivals.\n\n''I'm not sure I liked how we responded,'' coach George Karl said. ''We had a tough, bad refereed game. But we can't emotionally lose it.''\n\nThe Kings were excited to have a healthy Cousins for the first time in three meetings with the Warriors this season. But the All-Star big man played less than 13 minutes before getting ejected. After sitting out most of the first half in foul trouble, Cousins was upset after getting called for his fifth foul in the third quarter.\n\nMonty McCutchen then called Cousins for a technical, setting him off on a tirade that led to another technical called by Mitchell Ervin and an ejection.

But Casspi's sharp shooting seemed to wake up Stephen Curry, who missed his first six shots and was scoreless for the first 20:44 of the game.\n\nHe ended that drought with a 3-pointer that started a stretch of him scoring 17 straight Golden State points in the final 3:16 of the half. Stephen Curry hit five 3s and a layup during that span to the delight of the home crowd.\n\n''I just found a spark and shots started to fall,'' he said.

They direct traffic in and out of your network (hopefully doing so with at least a modicum of security). But while they sit by idly waiting for packets to route, they do nothing. And as for updating...that's generally on the user to handle.\n\nThere's a crowd funded piece of technology that aims to change all of that. The Turris Omnia is a router of a completely different nature. Not only does it automatically update its firmware (as soon as a vulnerability is discovered and patched), it can serve as a DNLA (Digital Living Network Alliance), a backup server (you have to plug in an external drive for this), you can insert a SIM card to ensure connection failover, connect to SFP, and much more. The Omnia is based on OpenWRT and is, as you might expect, open source).\n\nThe project has already reached its goals (by 367% as of this writing) and is ready to start shipping devices in April, 2016.\n\nOf course, this particular product won't come cheap. As of now, to get in on the fun you'll have to drop $189.00 USD. Is it worth it? At first blush, you might be thinking \"no\". Especially for a consumer application, a router with such a price tag seems a bit much.\n\nOr is it?\n\nConsider this: The need for security is at an all time high. Businesses get that. Consumers, on the other hand, do not. The average consumer still assumes \"password\" is too much of a password to have to remember or type. Those same users also assume that low-end router their ISP handed them two years ago is up to the task of keeping their network and data safe.\n\nChances are, it's not.\n\nI'm not necessarily saying everyone should immediately drop the coin for the Turris Omnia. But the idea that some generic router is up capable of handling modern-day network security is laughable. I get it, though. The router is the last piece of equipment anyone thinks about...until their network goes down. Most users have no idea how insecure an outdated router can be. Those same users have no idea how to log onto their router and check for updates. Some routers, such as the Motorola devices used by AT&T UVERSE, don't even offer the ability for users to update the software (they automatically update whenever the AT&T management platform rolls out an upgrade during a maintenance window, based on geolocation.\n\nYou should see the danger in that. When a vulnerability is found, that update might not hit your router for a while...leaving you unprotected. That, my friends, is why a router like the Turris Omnia is such an important upgrade to the home network. And because the Omnia is open source, vulnerabilities will be found and patched much more quickly than if it were proprietary.\n\nAnd if you're still a bit concerned about the cost of this router, consider the specs:\n\nCPU: 1.6 GHz dual-core ARM\n\nRAM: 1 GB DDR3\n\nStorage: 4 GB flash\n\nLAN 5x Gbit port\n\nWAN 1x Gbit port\n\nUSB 3.0\n\nYou'd be hard pressed to find another consumer-grade router with similar specs. So you can believe this baby will perform. And with the addition of the upgrade feature, the Omnia will be the router to have for anyone concerned about the security of their home network.\n\nWhich should be everyone.\n\nIs it perfect? No one knows yet. It is, however, a promising piece of technology that should go a long way to show the home networking space is in much need of improvement.\n\nWould you be willing to pay the high price for such a unique router?\n\nAlso see", "Yankees choice: Best bullpen ever, or one excellent trade chip": "View gallery . (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) New York Yankees games are only going to last six innings next season. Following the club's blockbuster trade for Cincinnati Reds closer Aroldis Chapman, the opposing team will be all but doomed once the seventh inning begins.\n\nAs currently constructed, Chapman will join Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller to form one of the most feared trios baseball has ever seen. The Yankees could employ one of the best bullpens of all-time next season because of those three.\n\nIt is, however, worth wondering whether this is the strategy the team should employ next year. While having a dominant bullpen is great, the Yankees could use some improvements in the rotation, and it would be nice to pick up some younger offensive pieces.\n\n[Related: The Yankees should hope Aroldis Chapman receives a lengthy suspension]\n\nPrior to acquiring Chapman, it was rumored that the club was willing to deal Miller. Considering the market for relievers this offseason, dealing Miller could net the Yankees multiple players who could help patch various holes. With Chapman now on the team, the Yankees would still feature a fairly elite bullpen.\n\nThat puts the Yankees in a difficult position: Should they keep all three players and employ one of the greatest bullpens of all-time, or are they better off trading Miller to improve other areas?\n\nIt's not hyperbole to say the Yankees could have one of the best bullpens in recent memory in 2016. The team was already in a good place last year, tying for second with a 5.3 fWAR from their relievers. Adding Chapman, who posted a 2.5 fWAR last year, to that mix, gives the team the second, third and sixth best relievers in the game according to fWAR.\n\nSince 1969, the year the mound was raised, the best bullpen ever constructed was the 2003 Los Angeles Dodgers. The club's pen boasted a 9.3 fWAR, much of which came from Eric Gagne, who was responsible for a ridiculous 4.5 fWAR that year.\n\nIn order for the Yankees to actually have the best bullpen since 1969, they would need to add 4 fWAR this offseason. That's not going to happen. Chapman, however, is a huge addition, and could give them close to a top-20 bullpen since 1969. Using just fWAR is a crude way to make this determination, but there's opportunity for this to be one of the best bullpens in recent memory.\n\nEven if you don't like the advanced metrics, the traditional numbers look pretty impressive.\n\nFrom my editor, @marcowill: Chapman, Miller, Betances in 2015 had 212 IP, 121 H, 14 HR, 93 BB, 347 Ks, 1.70 ERA. Like a Cy Young starter. \u2014 Jeff Passan (@JeffPassan) December 28, 2015\n\nConsidering some of the issues in the team's rotation, this could be a major advantage. Of the four veterans in the Yankees rotation, CC Sabathia led the team with 167 1/3 innings. Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda and Nathan Eovaldi all missed time due to injuries.\n\nView gallery . (Mitchell Layton/Getty Images)\n\nThose four will return in 2016, and all come with the same concerns. Tanaka is still pitching through a tear in his elbow, Pineda and Eovaldi have yet to throw 200 innings in a single season and Sabathia is a another year older. Luis Severino looked like a promising add in the middle of the season, but the team may want to limit his innings in 2016.\n\n[Elsewhere: Cuban pitcher Yaisel Sierra is now a free agent]\n\nWith a dominant bullpen, those issues aren't as much of a concern. Those players won't have to be pushed as hard early, meaning Pineda, Tanaka and Severino might be fresh during the second half. Sabathia is no longer a dominant innings-eater, so this covers up some of those issues. The club has some depth in Ivan Nova, but he was limited to 94 innings after coming off surgery and probably won't see a giant increase this season.\n\nAt the same time, why go into the season with so much uncertainty in the rotation if the club can bring in talent on the trade market? That's where dealing Miller starts to look desirable. The club could conceivably pick up a young starter, plus other pieces, to help shore up the rest of the team.\n\nView gallery . (Elsa/Getty Images) San Diego Padres received for Craig Kimbrel and the Philadelphia Phillies got for Ken Giles, it's conceivable to think the Yankees could get four players back in a deal for Miller.\n\nWhile that sounds great, getting enough talent to help right now is where things get tough. Getting a young, talented pitcher who can throw 170 innings for Miller would be excellent, but it's unlikely to happen. Teams don't just trade young, talented pitchers, even if dominant relievers are involved.\n\nVincent Velasquez fits that profile the most of any player involved in the Kimbrel and Giles trades, and he comes with a considerable amount of questions. He tossed less than 100 innings last season and it's unclear whether he can succeed in the majors as a starter. The Phillies don't need him to take on a huge role next season, so they can afford to wait as he develops.\n\nThe Yankees wouldn't have that ability. The club made the playoffs as a wild card team last year, and will likely attempt to contend again in 2016. If they deal Miller, they'll likely be looking for at least two players who could help them immediately. Getting a Velasquez type would help with the team's depth, but that might not be enough.\n\nIn that sense, it's probably best for the Yankees to sign one or two veteran starters who could eat innings once injuries occur. This is far from the sexiest team-building plan, but it gives them useful rotation fill-ins, and keeps the club's dominant bullpen in place.\n\n[Elsewhere: Are the Cardinals rattled by the fast-rising Cubs?]\n\nAll of this, of course, is dependent on whether Chapman receives a lengthy suspension following a domestic incident in October. Our own Jeff Passan covered the situation here, and broke the original story along with Tim Brown early in December. Major League Baseball introduced a new domestic violence policy last season, and Chapman will be one of the first players subject to punishment from new commissioner Rob Manfred. As of right now, there's no way to predict how Manfred will handle the situation.\n\nEven after the trade for Chapman, the Yankees still have significant questions. Some of those concerns, however, have been quieted by the team's ability to shut teams down after the sixth inning. It might be risky, and it's probably not the ideal way to build a club, but it worked for the Kansas City Royals last year.\n\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.

(AP) -- Forget about that rough stint with Dallas. It looks as if Brandon Weeden might be the right quarterback at the right time for the Houston Texans.\n\nWeeden scored his first career rushing touchdown and threw for two more as the Texans moved closer to the AFC South title with a 34-6 victory over the hapless Tennessee Titans on Sunday.\n\nHouston (8-7), which hosts Jacksonville in its regular-season finale next Sunday, lost out on a chance to clinch the division title when Indianapolis beat Miami 18-12 this weekend. The Texans could wrap it up on Monday night if Cincinnati wins at Denver.\n\n''We have to play to win,'' Houston coach Bill O'Brien said of his approach against Jacksonville. ''I think the bottom line is we need to win. I don't think we can look at any scenario, this scenario, that scenario, I believe that we need to play to win.''\n\nHouston has won seven of its last eight against the Titans. The Texans forced four turnovers and turned them into 17 points. Quintin Demps returned a fumble 33 yards for a touchdown less than two minutes into the game, putting Houston ahead to stay.\n\nJ.J. Watt even got his first sack since breaking his left wrist.\n\n''Quite frankly, it really doesn't matter what anybody else does,'' Watt said. ''We go out there and we win next week, that's all that matters.''\n\nThe Titans (3-12) did nothing to hurt their chances at the No. 1 pick in the draft, turning the ball over twice in the first quarter. Interim coach Mike Mularkey called it a disappointing loss, with a few fans wearing the day's giveaway - a cloth grocery bag - over their heads.\n\n''I really thought we were prepared,'' Mularkey said. ''I thought we had a good plan and felt good about it.''\n\nThe Texans scored a season high in points despite starting their fourth different quarterback this year.\n\nWith Brian Hoyer scratched before kickoff as he recovers from his second concussion in a month, Weeden became the first player in franchise history to throw for two TDs and run for another. He finished with 200 yards passing for his first win as a starter this season after coming off the bench to beat the Colts a week ago.\n\nWeeden began the season with the Cowboys and lost each of this three starts while subbing for the injured Tony Romo. He was cut by Dallas last month.\n\n''We needed this one,'' Weeden said. ''As a team, we needed this one. It feels good personally, I'm more excited for this team.''\n\nO'Brien even worked backup B.J. Daniels, signed Monday off Seattle's practice squad, onto the field. Daniels completed his first career pass in the first quarter, a 7-yarder to Jaelen Strong, and he finished the game in the fourth quarter.\n\nKareem Jackson stripped Antonio Andrews to end Tennessee's first series, a ball Demps picked up and ran in for the TD. Nick Novak also kicked a 22-yard field goal, and Weeden hit former Titans wide receiver Nate Washington for a 13-yard TD in the third quarter after Eddie Pleasant took the ball away from Andrews after a catch. That put Houston up 31-0.\n\nThe only good thing for the Titans was allowing just the one sack to Watt after Zach Mettenberger was sacked seven times in the first game between the teams Nov. 1. They also avoided being shut out at home for the first time since 1976 when Mettenberger hit rookie Tre McBride for a 1-yard TD with 91 seconds left.\n\nTitans wide receiver Kendall Wright started and caught three passes before going to the locker room with an injured knee, and left tackle Taylor Lewan left early in the second quarter to be checked for a concussion. Neither returned.\n\nNOTES: Houston LB Jadeveon Clowney left early in the fourth quarter with an injured left foot. O'Brien said he thought Clowney was fine. ... The Texans finished 4-4 on the road, beating all three divisional opponents on the road for the first time in franchise history. ... The Titans have not been shut out at home since Dec. 11, 1976, when the then-Oilers lost 21-0 to Pittsburgh.\n\n---\n\nFollow Teresa M.

Grubb was moved from Denny Hamlin's car a year ago to crew chief Edwards when JGR expanded to four cars.\n\n''We're still going through all that right now, and that's why where we are with the organization, we're going to wait and I'm not comfortable right now saying what is going to happen,'' Gibbs said Thursday. ''We have a lot to decide and with Denny's situation, he's going to sit down and be a big part of that so there's nothing we want to announce right now.''\n\nHamlin had knee surgery this week and did not travel to Las Vegas for the season-ending awards ceremony.\n\nEdwards said Gibbs had asked him not to discuss personnel moves until the team was ready to announce all of its plans. He praised the job Grubb did during the final stretch of the season, when Edwards advanced into the third round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship. He finished fifth in the final standings.\n\nGrubb won a championship in 2011 with Tony Stewart, but was let go by Stewart right after the title-winning run. He was then hired by JGR for Hamlin, and was one pit stop away from winning the championship with Hamlin last year.\n\nGrubb will likely be replaced by Dave Rogers, who has spent the last year as Hamlin's crew chief. Hamlin would then probably get Mike Wheeler, his former engineer who was moved into a crew chief role in the Xfinity Series to gain the experience for a Sprint Cup job.\n\nRogers joined JGR in in 2005 as crew chief for Jason Leffler. He was then partnered with Hamlin in the Xfinity Series.\n\nRogers returned to the Sprint Cup Series in 2009 with Kyle Busch but was moved to Hamlin last season.\n\nRogers has led teams to the Chase in five of seven seasons. He's accumulated 15 victories, 76 top fives and 114 top-10s in 230 starts.", "Juan Lagares had a strong Winter League": "Mets OF Juan Lagares hit .276 with a .333 OBP, seven runs scored and two stolen bases in 16 winter-league baseball games for Aguilas Cibaenas.\n\nLagares was 7 for 13 against left-handed pitching, but just 9 for 45 against righties.\n\nHe a breakout season in 2014, hitting .281, winning a Gold Glove and signing a four-year contract extension. However, he struggled at the plate and in the field during 2015, while battling the same sore elbow that cut his 2014 season short.\n\nDoctors examined Lagares' elbow during the last week of October and determined he would not need offseason surgery.\n\n\"Again, there hasn't really been a change in a long time in it, so the recommendation is not to have surgery,\" Mets assistant GM John Ricco said. \"I know Terry has said throughout the year that maybe we needed to be a little more aggressive with him in spring training in terms of a throwing program, as opposed to this year when we kind of backed off him and didn't have him throw as much. We're going to talk to the doctors and the trainers and figure it out.\"\n\nLast week, the Mets signed free agent OF Alejandro De Aza, who will be used in a platoon role with Lagares in center field, according to CBS Sports' Jon Heyman.\n\nDe Aza, 31, hit .278 with a .351 OBP against right-handed pitching last season with the Orioles, Red Sox, and Giants.\n\nMatthew Cerrone\n\nFacebook | Twitter | Instagram | About Me\n\nThe reports from Venezuela indicate Lagares looks healthy. He played strong in center field, picking up a few outfield assists and making impressive catches in the field. He hit last season for the Mets, that wasn't the issue. It was his fielding and arm that were lacking.\n\nThe buzz last summer was that he needed Tommy John surgery, because Terry Collins hinted that this might be the case. However, in talking to people connected to the team, I don't think that's in the cards -- or even the issue. Instead, it sounds to me like it's just general weakness, like it's his makeup, less an actual repairable injury. If this is accurate, a refined workout plan and rest may be the key to his success.\n\nIn the end, I still think the plan may be to have De Aza get half the starts against righties, with Lagares getting the other half, plus starts against lefties. In other words, Lagares will be the primary center fielder, while De Aza spots in him in certain games depending on the matchup.", "Toffoli gets hat trick; Quick, Kings beat Canucks 5-0": "Yahoo Sports' Shaun King and Graham Watson look ahead to the Orange Bowl, in which the Sooners and Tigers will meet in a bowl game for the second straight season.\n\nYahoo Sports' Greg Whyshynski answers your social media questions on all things hockey, like where Shea Weber would fit best if traded, who's the leading ROY candidate and what's wrong with Jonathan Toews?\n\nYahoo Sports' Shaun King and Graham Watson look ahead to the Cotton Bowl, which will feature a pair of old colleagues - Spartans head coach Mark Dantonio and Tide head coach Nick Saban - squaring off.\n\n8/25/15: A.J.

There wasn't much left by the end.\n\nTyler Toffoli scored three goals, Jonathan Quick got his 40th career shutout and the Kings beat the Canucks 5-0 on Monday night.\n\nThe Kings won their second straight and snapped Vancouver's two-game win streak.

Less than a minute later, Vancouver's Brandon Prust fought McNabb in an apparent attempt to avenge he hit on Sedin.\n\n''We had a good game but I think it all started with (McNabb) on the first shift,'' Toffoli said. ''Quick made some huge saves and kind of kept them out of it.''\n\nVancouver was shut out for the fourth time in its past 11 games.\n\n''We didn't let them come after us and I think that's the way you have to play if you're gonna be successful, but that played right into their hands,'' Canucks coach Willie Desjardins said.

The Kings outshot the Canucks 16-9 in the first after holding an 11-2 edge at one point.\n\nForbort gave the Kings a 2-0 lead at 1:57 of the second when his long slap shot deflected in off Pedan. McNabb put Los Angeles ahead 3-0 on another slap shot 10 minutes later after Kopitar won a faceoff and the puck went back to the blue line.\n\nToffoli scored his second goal at 5:55 of the third after he stole the puck while the Canucks were trying to come out of their zone and the disk eventually came back to him.

He was 85.\n\nMalzone died at home in Needham, Massachusetts, of natural causes, the team said.\n\nA member of the Red Sox hall of fame since 1995, he played in Boston for 11 seasons from 1955-65. He hit 131 homers with 716 RBIs during that stretch, the most of any third baseman in club history. The six-time All-Star finished his career in 1966 with the California Angels.\n\n''We mourn the loss of a man we all came to know as 'Malzie,' who was venerated by Red Sox fans not only for his great glove at third base, but for his blue-collar dedication to his craft,'' Red Sox chairman Tom Werner said in a statement.\n\nHe was often seen in spring training, many times riding a golf cart along with former Boston pitcher Luis Tiant, pausing to take pictures and chatting with fans at the club's complex in Fort Myers, Florida. He visited Fenway Park often after he retired from his work as a scout, instructor and in the team's front office.\n\nHe was a frequent visitor to games and shown on the scoreboard among ''Red Sox Legends.''\n\n''Frank was always there to give me a smile and a great word of encouragement every time I ran into him in my five years with the Red Sox,'' Boston's 2007 World Series MVP Mike Lowell said in the statement. ''He was always a symbol to me of what a professional and standup member of the organization should be. My heart goes out to his family and may he rest in peace. He will be missed.''\n\nMalzone played 150 or more games in seven straight seasons after missing just two games in his initial four with the Red Sox. He made it to the big leagues in 1955 after serving two years in the Army (1952-53) during the Korean War.\n\nMalzone won the Gold Glove three consecutive seasons (1957-59) and played in every game in two straight seasons from 1958-59. His consecutive-game streak of 475 remains the longest in team history since 1920.\n\nA New York native, he is survived by his sons Frank, Paul, John and Jim, daughter Anne O'Neill, eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.", "Seattle's Lynch moving closer to return from surgery": "RENTON, Wash. (AP) -- Coming off one of their ugliest performances of the season, the Seattle Seahawks needed a little good news.\n\nThey may be getting it with the potential return of running back Marshawn Lynch.\n\nCoach Pete Carroll indicated Monday that Lynch could rejoin the team later this week. It's the first sign of optimism that Lynch could be a factor for the Seahawks once the postseason arrives.\n\nBut Carroll cautioned that the team would have to see how Lynch is doing in person before deciding whether he will play in the regular-season finale this week at Arizona or in the wild-card round of the NFC playoffs.\n\n''We have to see him playing football and see if everything translates. He's always come back in really good shape, and been fast and strong and had his endurance and all that,'' Carroll said. ''We're kind of hoping that's the same when the time comes.''\n\nLynch has been out since undergoing abdominal surgery Nov. 25 to repair an injury related to a sports hernia. Lynch played through the injury in Seattle's Week 10 loss to Arizona, then sat out the following week against San Francisco before undergoing surgery with the hope of returning late in the season.\n\nThat plan seemed perfectly fine for Seattle with how rookie Thomas Rawls filled in. But that changed in Week 14 when Rawls broke an ankle and suffered ligament damage against Baltimore and was lost for the year. While Seattle got past Cleveland with a makeshift running game, the lack of a legitimate back became an obvious weakness in Sunday's 23-17 loss to St. Louis.\n\nCarroll said Lynch's status for this week would first depend on how he managed the next couple of days of personal workouts with mixed martial arts trainers in the Bay Area that Lynch has worked with in the past, and then if he is able to immediately translate that rehabilitation work into football practice.\n\n''We're pretty much relying on the reports they are giving us and the work that is being done,'' Carroll said. ''Those guys know him really well and really for the last few years have done great work with him, and we're trusting that they are looking seriously at the preparation level and endurance and all of those things to give us an indication we can move forward.''\n\nCarroll's optimistic tone about Lynch came a day after Seattle's five-game winning streak was snapped, taking away control of the No 5 seed in the NFC playoffs. Even with a victory on Sunday in Arizona, the Seahawks could still fall to the sixth seed in the conference if Minnesota wins at Green Bay.\n\nA loss to the Cardinals would land the Seahawks in the No. 6 spot no matter the outcome in the NFC North and ensure any postseason run by Seattle is entirely on the road.\n\n''We're banking on that we have built up a pretty good process in how we do it,'' Carroll said. ''We have the really good back to backs. We're going to have to go back to back, maybe to back, to do something really special.''\n\nBut first the Seahawks must correct the problems that emerged in the loss to the Rams, and most of them can be attributed to struggles on the offensive line in the first half. Quarterback Russell Wilson was under constant pressure from the Rams' defensive front, and Seattle's run game was nonexistent. The Seahawks had just 14 yards rushing in the first half and 60 for the game, snapping a string of 25 straight games rushing for at least 100 yards as a team.\n\nBy the time Seattle made corrections it was facing a 16-0 deficit and having to rely on the pass to rally.\n\n''That we were so unlike what we have been,'' Carroll said, ''the consistency that we have come to really appreciate wasn't there.''\n\nNOTES: Carroll said T Russell Okung (calf) and SS Kam Chancellor (pelvis/tailbone) both have a chance of making it back this week, but if they don't they should be ready for the playoffs. ... TE Luke Willson (concussion) was making progress after leaving Sunday's game following a hit to the head in the first half. ... DE Michael Bennett has been bothered by a toe injury and Carroll said the team would ''take care of it this week with some stuff that we're going to do with him,'' but he should be able to play against Arizona.\n\n---\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL", "With few voices, Muslim-American athletes in difficult position": "A Houston mosque caught fire Friday, forcing worshippers to move to a temporary space in a shopping mall the next day. Investigators say the two-alarm blaze was set intentionally. This could be one more example of anti-Muslim sentiment in the weeks since terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif. According to one poll, only 27 percent of Americans had a favorable view of Muslims. That poll was taken last year.\n\nFor Muslim athletes like Oday Aboushi, the growing mistrust of people of his faith is both a disappointment and an opportunity.\n\nAboushi, who was born in New York, has been troubled by the comments of politicians like presidential candidate Donald Trump, who proposed restrictions on Muslim immigration and has done little to tamp down anti-Muslim sentiment. View gallery . (Getty Images)\n\n\"It's more alarming that a person is proposing something like this,\" he says. \"It's such a small-minded idea. How can you punish a whole religion based off a few people? If people did that, the world will be doomed. To have a guy like that is alarming. What are his true motives? Imagine what's next, what's possible, what else is he willing to step over or on.\"\n\nAboushi has a distinctly American story: his Palestinian parents were born in East Jerusalem and they emigrated to the United States \u2013 his mother to Michigan and his father to New York. Aboushi was born in Brooklyn, raised in New York City and played college football at Virginia. He was honored by the State Department in 2011 for his athletic contributions as a Muslim-American. He says part of the calling of his faith is to donate a portion of his salary to charity and he says he has done so, in addition to making trips to Sudan to help children with cleft palates.\n\n\"It's a very peaceful religion,\" he says. \"It's about helping others, treating people how you want to be treated.\"\n\nThere aren't a great deal of prominently visible Muslim leaders in America, in politics or popular culture, and so comments from presidential candidates and pundits are passed around far more than any kind of rebuttal or clarification from actual Muslims. That has put Muslim athletes in a position of speaking for a diverse faith, and of trying to teach people that extremists and terrorists are not only outliers, but completely out of the teachings of what they believe in. Over the past two weeks, NFL players such as Ameer Abdullah and Isa Abdul-Quddus have spoken out against Trump's views.\n\n\"There's a basis of innocence to [Islam],\" Aboushi says. \"It has a basis in humanity. But the reputation of Muslims is going to get tarnished because of the few individuals that are doing things on their own terms.\"\n\n[Yahoo Daily Fantasy: $10 could win you $20K in our $200K contest for Week 17]\n\nPresident Barack Obama said in a televised speech earlier this month that Muslims \"are our sports heroes,\" and Trump replied on Twitter with bafflement. \"What sport is he talking about, and who?\" Trump asked.\n\nTwo of the most successful athletes in the history of American sports, Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, are both Muslim. Both offered strong statements of rebuke. But Trump's response underscores reality: there aren't that many famous Muslims in American popular culture.\n\n\"There's not the Pope for Muslims,\" says Amaar Abdul-Nasir, founder of the Muslim sports blog UmmahSports.net. \"There's not a recognized person, where this guy is a leader of the faith, so what he says, goes.\"\n\nView gallery . Ameer Abdullah (AP)\n\nAbdul-Nasir's site, which is affiliated with MuslimMatters.org, attempts to cover Muslims in American sports, but it's not political in scope. \"I wish more Muslims spoke out on social or political issues,\" he says, \"but I don't feel comfortable saying, 'You should do this.' Because it's a complex religion, I don't expect a lot of athletes to be experts or scholars. I might not feel comfortable answering about the faith because I don't have the right answer.\"\n\nSome Muslims, like Abdul-Jabbar (and Abdul-Nasir), converted to the faith. Some, like Aboushi, were raised in the faith. Many conflate Muslim-Americans with Arab-Americans, but in fact the majority of Arab-Americans are Christian. Fear of \"radical Islam\" has in some cases overshadowed truths about Islam.\n\nAboushi is all too familiar with this, as a blog once described him as a \"Muslim extremist\" and the director of the Anti-Defamation League had to make a statement to defend him. \"Being pro-Palestinian does not mean you're an anti-Semite or an extremist,\" Abraham Foxman wrote. \"The record simply does not show that Aboushi has crossed that line.\"\n\nYears later, it's not his own reputation on the line but that of his entire faith.\n\n\"It's an unfortunate situation,\" Aboushi says, \"but it's an opportunity to correct people and let them know what the religion is about. They're not just gonna learn.

Sierra defected back in April and had to go through the process of being cleared by MLB and unblocked by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\n\nSierra, 24, participated in a showcase event earlier this offseason, which Sanchez says was attended by roughly 350 scouts and evaluators. Sierra impressed during the workout but was facing mostly high school kids.

Sierra used a splitter earlier in his career but has since settled on a changeup. Badler also notes Sierra has \"poor command and pitchability,\" which limits his ceiling.\n\nHere's some video of Sierra from his recent showcase event:\n\nBecause of his age, Sierra is not subject to the international spending restrictions imposed by MLB each summer. He's a true free agent who can sign a contract of any size with any team. That includes clubs like the Yankees, Cubs and Dodgers, who are saddled with spending limits after handing out huge international bonuses in recent years.\n\nCuban righty Raisel Iglesias signed a seven-year contract worth $27 million with the Reds last offseason, which seems like a decent enough contract estimate for Sierra. At the time of his signing, there were concerns whether Iglesias would remain a starter long-term or move into a relief role. He had a 4.15 ERA (95 ERA+) in 95 1/3 innings covering 16 starts and two relief appearances in 2015.\n\nAlthough the big names are off the board, several quality free agent pitchers remain unsigned, including Scott Kazmir, Wei-Yin Chen, Kenta Maeda, Yovani Gallardo and Ian Kennedy.

That\u2019s the last thing a mediocre team needs, a ninth-inning wipeout reliever.\n\n[Play Yahoo's New Year's Eve bowl contest where everyone takes home at least a $1]\n\nThere aren't any questions about Chapman the pitcher. He has a career 2.17 ERA and 1.02 WHIP over 319 innings, with a silly 15.4 K/9 rate. He registers 3.52 strikeouts for every walk. If you like to see the radar gun pop over 100 mph, Chapman is your guy. He's recorded 145 saves over the last four years.\n\nWhile Chapman presumably heads to the Yankees as their closer \u2014 and he\u2019s been clear in the past, he doesn\u2019t want to be yanked from the ninth inning \u2014 he\u2019s headed to one of the deepest bullpens in the majors. Left-hander Andrew Miller racked up 36 sacks last year with a 2.04 ERA and 0.86 WHIP, striking out 100 men in 61.2 innings. Right-handed flamethrower Dellin Betances picked up nine saves of his own, along with a 1.50 ERA, 1.01 WHIP, and 131 punchouts in 84 innings.\n\nPerhaps the Yankees can talk Miller out of the ninth inning \u2014 when they signed him a year ago, Miller made it clear he\u2019d fill whatever role the club wanted. Or perhaps the Yankees will look at Miller as expendable now that Chapman is in place. The trade market wasn\u2019t rich for Chapman given the baggage over his head. Miller would be an easier sell to most clubs.\n\nThe Yankees were able to land Chapman without denting their farm system. Although the Reds grabbed four prospects in Monday\u2019s deal, none of them were considered in the Top 5 of the organization. Rookie Davis, 22, is the best of the lot, a pitcher who made it to Double-A last year. Third baseman Eric Jagielo, a former first-round pick coming off an injury-riddled season, is also part of the deal, along with reliever Caleb Cotham and second baseman Tony Renda.\n\nThe Reds don\u2019t have to pick a new closer anytime soon, but J.J. Hoover might be the leader in the clubhouse. His 2.94 ERA and 1.17 WHIP from last year look passable on paper, but he only struck out 7.3 batters per nine innings \u2014 mediocre for a reliever, let alone a ninth-inning guy \u2014 and his K/BB rate was a modest 1.7. This could turn into an open audition during spring training.", "VMware is trying to hire angry employees away from crashed unicorn Good Technology": "At least one person sees the latest not-so-happy-ending of crashed unicorn Good Technology as an opportunity.\n\nThat would be Sanjay Poonen, the general manager running VMware's competitor to Good.\n\nHe's reaching out to disenfranchised Good employees, trying to hire them for VMware, sources tell us.\n\nTo recap, Good Technology sold to its long-time competitor BlackBerry for $425 million in September, but as the New York Times reported, many of Good's employees were upset about the deal. Their common stock became nearly worthless while investors' preferred stock took home nearly all of the payout. This came after a period in which Good raised a round that valued it at over $1 billion, filed to go public then scrapped its IPO plans, and reportedly failed to close a sale to CA Technologies for $825 million.\n\nGiven this history, some employees with Good stock felt ripped off \u2014 especially some who had paid tax bills based on earlier valuations.\n\nVMware's Poonen was on the short list for Good's CEO\n\nPoonen came to VMware from SAP and took over VMware's End-User Computing business, a unit previously best known for a revolving door of executive leadership.\n\nPeople close to VMware tell us that prior to taking the VMware role, Poonen was on the short list to take on the CEO job at Good too.\n\nShortly after he arrived, he orchestrated one of VMware's largest acquisitions, the $1.54 billion purchase of AirWatch \u2014 a Good competitor.\n\nAirWatch and Good compete in the \"mobile device management\" (MDM) market, which helps IT professionals secure and manage their fleets of mobile devices like tablets and smartphones.\n\nIt's a market in a free-fall since big software companies like IBM, SAP and VMware started snapping up the MDM players, and the operating system makers like Apple, Google, and Microsoft started adding more MDM features to their offerings.\n\nThe biggest standalone competitor remaining is MobileIron, which went public in June 2014, and has been struggling mightily for a while, its stock currently trading around $4 \u2014 less than half its IPO price.\n\nWhen Good sold to its arch-nemesis Blackberry, many employees didn't want to go work for the company that they been vilifying. \"They spent their entire careers and history at Good, heaping coals on Blackberry,\" this person told us. \"You can't change the culture of a firm overnight.\"\n\nThis person says that many Good employees \"are are just plain jaded, and want out.\"\n\nSo Poonen and VMware saw their chance.

(Getty)\n\nOr that they\u2019d launch an animus that would rage 22 years later.\n\nRegardless, there's still animosity on both sides.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like him because of the way he acts,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with his technique. It\u2019s the way he acts. Acts like a tough [expletive]. He runs his mouth.\u201d\n\nGracie and Shamrock meet in the main event of Bellator 149 in Houston on Feb. 19. No one is expecting the fight between the UFC hall of famers to be a classic.\n\nGracie, 49, of Torrance, Calif., has not competed since a decision win over Kazushi Sakuraba in 2007. Shamrock, for his part, has lingered on and off on the periphery of the fight game, losing eight of his last 10 bouts. The 51-year-old returned from a retirement of five years in June and lost to Kimbo Slice at Bellator 138.\n\nRegardless what one might think of the quality of the action in the cage when they meet in February, the dislike between the two remains raw and real, two decades on. In between shooting vignettes and interviews at GMT Studios, Gracie and Shamrock bickered, coming off something like a pair of middle-aged former high school football opponents wearing their varsity jackets to a local bar.\n\nGracie and Shamrock met twice in the UFC\u2019s early days. At UFC 1, Gracie submitted Shamrock in 57 seconds in a tournament semifinal bout. The rematch at UFC 5, the first non-tournament bout in UFC history, was also the first with a time limit. The April 7, 1995 match went one 30-minute round, followed by a pair of three-minute overtimes, before the bout, which did not have judges, was declared a draw. It\u2019s still the longest fight in UFC history.\n\nShamrock\u2019s bitterness in large part stems from the way the Gracie family controlled things behind the scenes in the early days of the UFC.\n\nThose who were around back in the day understand he UFC was never intended to become the big-money, corporate, network-affiliated promotional juggernaut it has become. It was, essentially, designed to be an informercial for Gracie jiu-jitsu as a self-defense technique. And while the fight outcomes weren\u2019t predetermined, Rorion Gracie, behind the scenes, made sure the rules favored brother Royce.\n\nGracie was allowed to wear his gi at UFC 1. Shamrock, who had a wrestling background and had competed in shootfights in the Japanese Pancrase promotion, was not allowed to wear his wrestling shoes.\n\nSo, to this day, Shamrock disputes the finish, in which he claims Gracie used the gi to choke him out.\n\nView gallery . Will Ken Shamrock get his revenge two decades after his last fight against Royce Gracie? (Getty)\n\n\u201cI go in there, and we\u2019re grappling, and I can\u2019t push back because my feet are slipping. So I go back and he\u2019s on top of me and it's like being on ice. So he grabs his gi and he wraps it around my neck and he\u2019s choking me. And as he\u2019s choking me, this is all within the fight is what I\u2019m thinking. It\u2019s a weapon. So the refs like, \u2018He tapped,\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018He choked me. He choked me with the gi.\u201d\n\nGracie, for his part, rolled his eyes at Shamrock\u2019s claim and made a crude gesture with his hand.\n\n\u201cIs that why he lost?\u201d Gracie mocked. \u201cHe could have used the gi to his advantage. And then he said he didn\u2019t know where he\u2019s going. He\u2019s a grappler. The guy before that, he beat up like nothing. And the guys, after that, he beat up like nothing. So, excuses, excuses, excuses.\u201d\n\nThus was MMA\u2019s first grudge born. Anticipated tournament rematches never materialized. Shamrock didn\u2019t participate at UFC 2, in which Gracie repeated as tourney champion. At the chaotic UFC 3, Gracie pulled out of the tourney with an injury following a first-round win over Kimo Leopoldo, at which point Shamrock, who had defeated Feliz Mitchell in the semifinals, also withdrew (Trivia note: Into the void stepped Omaha police officer Steve Jennum, who became the most unlikely UFC tourney winner ever as a substitute when he defeated Harold Howard).\n\nBy UFC 5, the promoters had wised up to the fact that short of matching up what by this point was their two most popular fighters in the first round and eliminating one right off the bat, their chances of the two meeting in the finals or even semis were a crapshoot. So with the UFC\u2019s initial popularity cresting, they met in Charlotte in the first billed main event in company history.\n\nHere\u2019s where the stories get crossed again. Shamrock says he trained for the months on what amounts to a primitive ground-and-pound game plan, with the idea of slowly wearing Gracie out. He says he didn\u2019t find out about the newly instituted time limit \u2013 done in large part to ensure the PPV didn\u2019t run over allotted satellite time \u2013 until the day before the bout.\n\nMost of the fight went off with Shamrock in Gracie\u2019s guard. Shamrock was better prepared to defend the choke. Gracie, who could have went all night waiting for an opening if he had to \u2013 he once went 90 minutes in Japan against Sakuraba \u2013 was willing to play the game.\n\nShamrock will forever call himself the winner.\n\n\u201cI beat his ass up, I mean, who would you call the winner of the fight?\u201d Shamrock said. \u201cThe guy with the blown-up eye or the guy who\u2019s fresh. You can call it a draw or what you want, but he got his ass kicked, and he won\u2019t give credit for that.\u201d View gallery . Royce Gracie (Getty)\n\nGracie, as you might expect by now, disagrees.\n\n\u201cHe came in to play for the draw,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cIf you fight somebody 40-50 pounds lighter than you, and you don\u2019t beat that person ... dude. I\u2019m 178, if I don\u2019t beat someone 40 pounds lighter, and I don\u2019t beat somebody up, I\u2019ll put my head in the toilet and I\u2019ll flush it. That\u2019s why the lightweights can\u2019t finish the heavyweight. For the heavyweights? Imagine [Wladimir] Klitschko feeling happy he fought to a draw with [Floyd] Mayweather. And he walked around dancing happy that he got the draw.\u201d\n\nUFC 5 marked the end of the Gracie family\u2019s involvement with the early UFC. Shamrock, for his part, stuck around, and at UFC 6 defeated Dan Severn for what was then called the Superfight championship, the forerunner of the heavyweight title now held by Fabricio Werdum.\n\nIt took two decades to get around to the trilogy fight. Gracie-Shamrock III probably won\u2019t be an artistic masterpiece, but that\u2019s not the point. Bellator\u2019s all about using classic names to lure in viewers for their biggest shows, as everyone from Shamrock to Kimbo to Tito Ortiz and Stephan Bonnar have proven.

It didn't work out that way, as Carolina fell short, 20-13, putting an end to their pursuit of an undefeated season.\n\nBut Tuesday marks the eighth anniversary of the last time an NFL team completed a perfect regular season, and the first time a team went 16-0: on Dec. 29, 2007, the New England Patriots beat the New York Giants, 38-35, at the Meadowlands.\n\nWe all know what happened a few weeks later \u2013 the Giants upset the Patriots in the Super Bowl, ending their desire to become the league's first 19-0 team \u2013 but that night, there was no way of knowing how things would ultimately end.\n\nThe Saturday night game was meaningless in some ways, as the Patriots had long since clinched the AFC's top seed in the playoffs, and the Giants had clinched an NFC wild-card spot. But it held meaning in others: there was the Patriots' pursuit of perfection, of course, as well as Tom Brady and receiver Randy Moss both close to breaking single-season records, Brady for passing touchdowns and Moss for receiving touchdowns.\n\nIt was supposed to be shown only on NFL Network, but the league gave in to pressure and simulcast the game on two of its network partners, NBC and CBS, allowing millions more viewers to see history potentially made.\n\nAnd the Giants were not about to give the game to New England, either. They led by five at halftime and by 12 points with over five minutes gone in the third quarter before the Patriots started their comeback, scoring the next three touchdowns to take a 10-point lead.\n\nThe middle of those three scores was a 65-yard sideline bomb from Brady to Moss, one pass that gave each man a place in the record book.\n\nAfter the game, the Patriots were happy, of course - a reporter from Japan asked Randy Moss for some words for his fans in that country and Moss replied, \"Konichiwa, homie\" - but also relieved.

He was 57.\n\nHenderson died early Sunday morning at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, according to a statement from the Mariners, one of five teams Henderson played for in his career. Henderson had a kidney transplant in late October.\n\nHenderson was best known for his home run in the 1986 AL Championship Series for Boston. With the Red Sox one strike from elimination in Game 5, Henderson hit a two-run homer in the top of the ninth against the California Angels to send the series back to Boston. The Red Sox won Games 6 and 7 to advance to the World Series.\n\n''His home run in Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS was a signature moment in Red Sox history, and we shared his unbridled joy when he hopped into the air as the ball cleared the fence in Anaheim,'' Red Sox President Sam Kennedy said in a statement. ''Hendu played just two seasons in Boston, but we always regarded him as one of us, and are grateful for the time we were able to enjoy his talent and infectious personality.''\n\nBut beyond his memorable playoff moment, Henderson was a reliable contributor to four teams that reached the World Series and played 14 seasons total in the majors. His greatest success came from 1988-91 with Oakland. During that four-year stretch, the A's went to the World Series three times.\n\nHenderson played in 575 regular-season games during that span, hitting .275 with 84 homers, 123 doubles and 322 RBIs. Henderson was an All-Star in 1991.\n\nView gallery FILE - This Oct. 16, 1986 file photo shows Boston Red Sox center fielder Dave Henderson during a loc \u2026\n\n''Henderson was an instrumental part of the A's 1989 World Series championship club and an even more impactful member of the A's family and community,'' the A's said in a statement. ''Hendu and his smile will be sorely missed. Our thoughts are with his family.''\n\nHenderson began his career in Seattle as the first draft pick in the history of the Mariners franchise in 1977. He made his debut in 1981 and played parts of six seasons with the Mariners. Henderson was traded to Boston during the 1986 season and later played for San Francisco and Kansas City.\n\n''He was a devoted father to his two sons and always willing to help someone in need,'' Mariners President Kevin Mather said in a statement. ''Dave was one of the most popular Mariners in our history, but Dave was also one of the most popular players in Red Sox and A's history. He had a special ability to connect with people, both inside the game and in the communities in which he lived. I never saw him at the ballpark, or on the golf course, without a big smile on his face.''\n\nAfter his playing career ended, Henderson spent time as a broadcaster for the Mariners and ran fantasy camps for A's and Mariners fans. He also raised funds to support research of Angelman Syndrome, a genetic disorder that affected his son Chase.\n\nHenderson was born July 21, 1958, in Merced, California. He is survived by sons Chase and Trent, wife Nancy and his first wife, Loni.", "Stats: Dray Day": "Draymond Green is quite the unique player. Last year, it was all about his defensive prowess and versatility, earlier this year it was about his passing and helping set up the Warriors offense, and now his scoring has been the story.\n\nIn his last seven games, Green averaged 21.0 points, 10.6 boards, 6.9 assists, 2.1 steals, 1.6 blocks and 2.1 treys on 53.7 effective field goal percentage (eFG%). He also had a 23.8 usage rate in his 37.9 minutes. That\u2019s almost double his 11.7 points per game from last season and Green was putting up just 13.0 points per game in his first 23 games this year. So what\u2019s up with the increase?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the easy stuff. His volume is way up right now and he only had an 18.2 usage rate in his first 23 games. Plus, his minutes have increased 3.9 per game and his efficiency is up a shade at 1.1 percent. Perhaps the interesting part is who he\u2019s taking the usage away from. In the first 23 games, Stephen Curry had a 32.9 usage rate, but Curry dropped to 28.4 in usage rate in his last seven \u2014 Klay Thompson \u2019s usage rate has also increased. Plus, Harrison Barnes not playing has helped Green\u2019s output.\n\nHis shot chart in his hot streak is pretty wild:\n\nView gallery .\n\nSo 147 points in seven games with just two attempts on mid-range shots. He only had 16 attempts in his first 23 games, so mid-range scoring wasn\u2019t his bag, baby. The big increase for his shot location stuff is all those easy buckets at the rim and he\u2019s not even making that many of them with his sub-par 53.2 percent. That means he could be even better with his efficiency.\n\nThe Warriors offense can work wonders and Green is really playing better off the ball. In his last seven, he was assisted on a whopping 80.4 percent of his shots. Green has also been open (defender beyond four feet of him) on 30 of his 31 attempts from deep in his last seven. Green also has shot without a dribble 62.4 percent of the time in his last seven, so he isn't trying to do too much.\n\nThe increase in efficiency seems to be for real, but there are a lot of factors giving a false positive on his high usage rate lately. Green will probably be more of a 15-16 point going forward. He\u2019s still going to do a ton of other things on the stat sheet and should be a top-15 player going forward in season-long leagues and a high-end guy in DFS.\n\nDown with the King?\n\nWhat\u2019s up with LeBron James ? His last four games have been a nightmare, making 38.0 percent from the field and 63.3 percent from the line. Plus, he made just 2-of-16 from beyond the arc in that run. Here\u2019s his shot chart:\n\nView gallery .\n\nYikes. LeBron has really struggled on his shots outside of the restricted area all season and he\u2019s made just 31.9 percent on mid-range, which accounts for 21.6 percent of his shots.\n\nThis raises the ol\u2019 shot selection talk. If he\u2019s taking too many shots of ones he\u2019s not making, that\u2019s kind of a problem. We all know LeBron is at his best when he gets to the rim, but he\u2019s still not this bad. Check out his closest defender numbers on shots from greater than 10 feet away from the rim from this year (top) and last year (bottom):\n\nView gallery .\n\nThat\u2019s pretty bad. He\u2019s somehow made just 24.3 percent of his 37 shots when he\u2019s wide open and just 29.9 percent of his 117 shots when he\u2019s open. Basically, the poor shooting is a little fluky.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen LeBron go through shooting slumps before, but this is a major one. He\u2019s been one of the worst high-volume jump shooters and he should turn it around \u2014 he actually has the highest usage rate in the last 10 games among starters. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s forcing shots and he\u2019s really just missing the open ones.\n\nFor season-long fantasy, there should still be some concern of him getting some rest, so he\u2019s not really a buy-low guy. He should still be able to snap out of it for DFS and it could start tonight. Although, he\u2019s been bad on the second half of a back-to-back and is worse on the road, too. On the other hand, the Nuggets are a disaster at defending small forwards and tonight is a stars-scrubs kind of night. Kyrie Irving is out and Kevin Love is banged up, too.\n\nCall me Ishmael\n\nIsh Smith has been quite the white whale these days. On Monday, he was the first 76er to score 20-plus points with 10-plus assists since Thaddeus Young on Mar. 3, 2014. Smith put up 22 points, three rebounds, 11 assists, two steals and one 3-pointer in 32 minutes. In his two games with the 76ers, he put up a 31.1 usage rate to go with his 8.0 assists per game in just 31.5 minutes per game.\n\nSmith was playing very well with the Pelicans and made a career-high 43.0 percent from the field before he was traded. He was also made a career-high 79.6 percent from the line this year, which would go a long way in boosting his value in standard leagues.\n\nWe all know about the positives with Smith. He has assistant coach Mike D\u2019Antoni helping him run the offense and D\u2019Antoni has seen a lot of point guards go off when he has a say in the offense. Plus, Smith has a whopping 106.7 pace in his two games and one of those two games was against the slowest team in the league, the Utah Jazz \u2014 the Warriors are leading the NBA in pace at 102.1.\n\nThe 76ers don\u2019t trade away picks. Like ever. However, they gave up two picks for Ish because they are just tired of getting nothing out of their point guards this year. They cut Tony Wroten, Kendall Marshall played just four minutes on Monday, and T.J. McConnell isn\u2019t really a threat to Ish. We know the minutes are going to be there along with the usage, steals and some other stuff, too.\n\nThe question on Ish is all about the efficiency. Obviously owners in DFS shouldn\u2019t care too much, but in season-long leagues it\u2019ll be really important for him to convert.\n\nHe\u2019s not really a complex scorer, so let\u2019s take a look at his shot chart this year (top) and last year (bottom):\n\nView gallery .\n\nView gallery .\n\nHe lives at the rim and he\u2019s still right at around 42 percent for his shot total coming from that range. The big difference is that he\u2019s 8.7 percent better on those this year. That\u2019s a good sign right there and he\u2019s taking a lot less on those non-restricted twos \u2014 that\u2019s a really tough shot for a short player.

''However, I respond tonight only for the benefit of our fans. ... They deserve better than to read this scurrilous story, which the editors of the TP decided to blast on the front page.''\n\n''What strikes me the most is the pure irony of the Times Picayune imploring me to sell for the benefit of the city,'' the statement continued. ''I recall in May, 2012, reaching out to the Newhouse family, imploring them to sell to me or other local ownership as they threatened to become and then became a part-time newspaper. Since then the newspaper has done nothing but layoff (sic) staff and move operations out of town.\n\n''I take great pride in promoting New Orleans as a big league city - securing a record number of Super Bowls, getting naming rights deals for both the Superdome and arena, and infusing millions of tax revenue into our state's general fund,'' the statement said. ''This is on top of the large investments I have made in this city, and I will soon announce more major projects.''\n\nBenson, a New Orleans native, announced last January his plan to bequeath power over his pro sports franchises to his third wife, Gayle, instead of his daughter and her two children, who long appeared in line to take over the clubs. Since then, the Benson family has been embroiled in several lawsuits in state courts in both Louisiana and Texas, as well as in federal court in Louisiana. In a Louisiana civil lawsuit, Benson's estranged heirs have challenged whether their patriarch was mentally competent to change his succession plan. They argued he was being manipulated by his wife and an inner circle of executives.\n\nBenson was ruled competent by a civil district judge. That case is now on appeal.\n\n''I am not selling either team. That is not in my makeup. I am not retiring or stepping aside, while I do appreciate all of the sincere concern for my health,'' the statement said. ''The legacy of both these teams are still yet to be written and my legacy can be discussed when I am long gone, which by the way is not that important to me right now.\n\n''Another important part of our legacy is continuing to rebuild our city, our hospitals and our schools to make them leading institutions in this country,'' the statement said. ''My wife, Gayle, and I do not take this for granted and cherish our ability to participate and contribute annually.\n\nBenson's statement also disputed a suggestion that his role in day-to-day operations in his businesses has declined in recent years.\n\n''I have always been and continue to be in complete control of our teams, and that is not in dispute,'' the statement said. ''Furthermore, my plan to transfer complete control to Gayle is unassailable and designed to provide the long term stability and resources that all franchises need to produce consistently winning teams.''", "Bonds are boring, but should you own them?": "Bonds are boring, or so the saying goes. In theory, you can tuck them away, forget about them, and receive a predictable cash flow over a period of time. But bonds have risks, as do all investments, and sometimes they are more volatile than stocks.\n\nCredit risk\n\nThe price of a company\u2019s bond in the marketplace fluctuates with its ability to repay the principal amount. As the company\u2019s financial position gets weaker, investors will demand a higher rate of interest. Conversely, if the company\u2019s financial position becomes stronger, investors will require a lower interest rate.\n\nThe price of a bond is inversely proportional to its yield. If you buy a bond for $1,000 at a rate of 3.0% and the company becomes more risky, the market rate of the bond drops, and the yield correspondingly rises. This only affects the you if you want to sell the bond because the company is still obligated to pay the principal amount of $1,000. However, the secondary market prices-in the credit risk and other factors, which cause the market rate of the bond to fluctuate in value.\n\nIf a company that issues a bond loses the ability to repay the principal amount, the bond can lose much of its value. Rarely does the value go to zero because, even in a liquidation bankruptcy, assets of the company can be sold to pay-off part of the bond's principal. For a given company, there is also a hierarchy that determines which bonds pay the most in the event of liquidation.\n\nInterest rate risk\n\nBond prices fluctuate when interest rates change. If a $1,000 bond of an investment grade, or safe company, is yielding 2.0% and interest rates rise such that similar bonds are yielding 2.5%, the price of the bond will drop in the marketplace. The company must still pay the $1,000 principal, or par, amount of the bond, but the ability to sell it at that price in the secondary market diminishes.\n\nUntil December 16, the Federal Reserve had kept interest rates at near-zero since December, 2008, which was the height of the financial crisis. The target rate for short-term interest rates was raised to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%, and the Fed has telegraphed its intent to continue raising rates in 2016.\n\nIt is possible that short-term rates could rise to 2.00% by the end of 2016. Even though the Fed only targets short-term rates, its actions spread throughout the yield curve, affecting longer-term rates as well. Accordingly, a series of rate hikes by the Fed will likely decrease the market prices of bonds already issued. Bonds with short maturities will be affected most, but longer-term bonds will also be affected.\n\nLiquidity Risk\n\nWhen markets are in turmoil, cash is king. In a panic, the market for bad assets dries up, and investors sell their best assets to raise cash. Accordingly, this fire-sale process reverberates through all asset classes, both safe and risky.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to buy a bond and hold it to maturity, you might not be worried about your ability to sell it in the marketplace. However, large corporations typically hold a portfolio of bonds, and, according to accounting rules, they must reflect hypothetical profits and losses on those bonds based on current market rates.\n\nIn 2008, even short-term U.S. Treasurys, which are considered safe-haven assets, suffered declines during the worst of the market rout. Nevertheless, corporate treasurers tend to play it safe and load their accounts with government bonds. This means that in a financial panic, bond market liquidity affects the bottom line of all large corporations.\n\nOn December 9, 2015, the manager of Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund announced that it would suspend investor redemptions for at least one year, as the fund's net asset value had dropped by nearly 50% from its peak. This roiled credit markets, and yields on risky high yield bonds surged, causing a concomitant drop in their prices.\n\nThe event was significant enough for Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to weigh-in on the issue at her press conference following the December 16th Fed rate hike. She said the fund was over-weighted in risky energy bond bets but that the worst was likely over.\n\nShould you own bonds, stocks or both?\n\nAs the Fed raises rates, the higher yields of new investment grade bonds will increasingly become attractive to investors. But prices of already-issued bonds will be marked down in price because of their lower origination yields.\n\nTypically, when the Fed commences a rate-raising cycle, economic growth is strong, and the stock market continues to climb. This continues until rates become too high for risk markets to bear, which then causes risk markets to decline. The best time to own new bonds is when the Fed has finished raising rates because they will be the highest yielding bonds until the next business cycle peak.\n\nHistorical analogs suggest this is the time to own stocks, but prices of U.S. stocks languished in 2015, as the Dow Industrial and S&P 500 are relatively flat over the year.\n\nThis presents a dilemma for investors: both stocks and bonds seem to be bad bets right now. But time horizon also factors into investment decisions.\n\nAccording to Gregg Fisher, Chief Investment Officer at GersteinFisher, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to lock your money away for 5, 10 or 20 years, why do you want to be in credit over equity? The return per unit of risk on units of risky bonds versus safe bonds over long periods of time is not worthwhile\u2026You\u2019re better off in equities.\u201d", "Booms and Busts: Big-name quarterbacks spit the bit in Week 16": "\n\nTom Brady might be the best quarterback in football history. Ben Roethlisberger is on a Hall of Fame trajectory too, and has multiple championship rings. Cam Newton is the odds-on favorite to be the 2015 NFL MVP.\n\nBut in Week 16 \u2014 Championship Week for fantasy football \u2014 Brady, Roethlisberger and Newton were merely big names who were getting you beat.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Big Ben, whose Steelers were shockingly upset at Baltimore, 20-17. Roethlisberger stumbled through a 24-for-34, 215-yard afternoon, with zero touchdown passes and two interceptions. A third Big Ben pick \u2014 a pick-six, as it were \u2014 was wiped out by penalty.\n\nWhat happened to the glorious Pittsburgh passing game that riddled Denver last week?\n\nThe Ravens defense entered the day as an easy mark, a fantasy giveaway. Opposing teams had 28 touchdown passes and just four picks against Baltimore, with 3,392 passing yards. Your only pregame fear with the Steelers was the game staying competitive for three hours.\n\nOh, it stayed competitive. Somehow the Baltimore staff coaxed a competent game from new QB Ryan Mallett (274 yards, no turnovers, 95.0 rating), while the defense played its game of the year.\n\nDeAngelo Williams was Pittsburgh\u2019s star of the day (153 total yards on 23 touches, one score), but the big-name wideouts were held down. Antonio Brown (7-61-0, 11 targets) lost a touchdown on replay. Martavis Bryant had a stunning one-catch day on just three looks. Markus Wheaton (3-41-0, five targets) wasn\u2019t much of a factor.\n\nPerhaps it shouldn\u2019t be that much of a surprise when a division rival rises up and pulls off an upset, especially late in the year. That\u2019s the same narrative that tripped up the Panthers and Patriots.\n\nThe Falcons did the deed against Carolina, making Atlanta\u2019s season through a 20-13 upset. It\u2019s a far cry from the 38-0 pasting the Panthers laid on Atlanta two weeks back.\n\nNewton picked up an early touchdown run Sunday, but the passing game was a mess (17-for-30, 142 yards, 4.7 YPA). Ted Ginn\u2019s run of relevance hit a dead end, thanks to corner Desmond Trufant. Ginn finished with one piddly catch on three targets. The Panthers were oddly productive on the ground as a team (20-for-155, 7.8 a pop, several successful runs), but they had trouble stringing scoring drives together.\n\nThe Jets usually play the Patriots competitively, and their 26-20 victory, in overtime, goes down as the least surprising of our lead items. But no one expected Tom Brady to land on just 231 passing yards and one score. Perhaps Brady was begging for a wideout of note to work with \u2014 without Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola, the Pats struggled to move the sticks consistently. The New England offense line also had its hands full with the Jets pass rush.\n\nFor those brave souls who play Week 17, perhaps Roethlisberger and Brady can make it up to you. The Steelers and Patriots will be all out to win. We can\u2019t say the same about the Panthers, who will have to consider resting starters now that their dream of a perfect season is over.", "The 7 worst personal finance villains of 2015": "As part of what we hope will become a new tradition here at Yahoo Finance, we\u2019re taking a look back at the year\u2019s worst personal finance offenders: companies that cost customers millions of dollars and untold hours of grief through a host of nefarious practices.\n\nTo come up with the top 7 offenders, we sifted through dozens of actions taken by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against bad financial practices in 2015.

In this July 8, 2014 file photo, a woman walks past the Everest Institute in Silver Spring, Md. Corinthian Colleges \u2026\n\nIn February, the CFPB, working with the Department of Education, announced the now-defunct chain of for-profit colleges would forgive $480 million worth of private student loans. Regulators accused Corinthian, which owned dozens of schools opearting under the names Everest Institute, WyoTech and Heald College, of misleading students with over-inflated graduation and job placement rates. More than 60% of Corinthian borrowers wound up defaulting on their loans within three years, according to the CFPB \u2014 six times the rate for federal student loan borrowers. Interest rates for these loans were also twice as high as those rates on federal loans.\n\nThe loan forgiveness was a huge win for Corinthian borrowers, many of whom were left in the lurch when the company was ordered to close down a large portion of its campuses in 2014 and 2015. Most recently, in October, a federal court ruled in favor of the CFPB in a 2014 lawsuit against Corinthian, agreeing that Corinthian was liable for more than $530 million in loans taken out by students.\n\nVerizon and Sprint will pay $120 million for allowing third party merchants to hit their customers with unauthorized charges\n\nView gallery . sprint and t-mobile\n\nIn May, the CFPB found Verizon (VZ) and Sprint\u2019s (S) flawed billing systems had allowed third-party merchants to hit customers with millions of dollars worth of unauthorized charges. The practice, known as \u201ccramming,\u201d went on for nearly a decade from 2003 to 2014. Some customers were charged one-time fees ranging from 99 cents to $14.99, while others were stuck with monthly recurring charges of $9.99 for so-called \u201cpremium texting\u201d services (like horoscope and sports score updates). The worst part? Sprint and Verizon were profiting handsomely from the practice, pocketing 30%-40% of the gross revenue from these charges, according to the CFPB, all while failing to keep track of customers who had submitted complaints. They aren\u2019t the first mobile providers to get caught cramming \u2014 AT&T and T-Mobile have settled similar lawsuits as well.\n\nCustomers have until Dec. 31, 2015, to file a claim for a refund: visit www.sprintrefundpsms.com or www.cfpbsettlementverizon.com.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s largest savings bank purposefully avoided lending to Black and Hispanic homebuyers\n\nView gallery . Source: Wikipedia Commons\n\nRedlining, a practice through which businesses go out of their way to avoid servicing people of certain racial and ethnic backgrounds, was found to be alive and well in 2015. In September, Hudson City Savings Bank (HCBK), the largest savings bank in New Jersey with 135 branches, paid $33 million to settle claims it marketed mortgages in areas mostly populated by white homeowners in New Jersey and Long Island. The CFPB, working alongside the Department of Justice, found that in 2014, only 25 of the 1,886 mortgages the bank approved went to black homeowners. This was the result of a targeted effort to avoid areas with a heavy minority presence. In 2011 and 2012, 94.5% of Hudson City\u2019s top mortgage broker offices were outside minority Black and Hispanic areas, according to the CFPB. The settlement \u2014 which included $25 million in direct loan subsidies to qualified borrowers in the affected communities, $2.25 million in community programs and outreach, and a $5.5 million penalty \u2014 was the largest redlining settlement in history, according to the CFPB. The subsidies go toward helping borrowers with down payments, closing costs and reduced interest rates.\n\nThe CFPB and DOJ filed similar claims in May against Provident Funding Associates, a California mortgage broker, calling on it to pay $9 million in damages. The complaint alleges the company wrongfully charged black and Hispanic borrowers higher broker fees on mortgage loans.\n\nIt took RushCard weeks to restore service to hundreds of thousands of prepaid debit card customers who lost access to their accounts , cutting off their only access to cash\n\nView gallery .

For a user base largely consisting of low-income minorities without savings accounts to fall back on, the impact was devastating. RushCard, founded by hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, is now in hot water with regulators. The CFPB is investigating the debacle but has yet to file formal charges or levy specific fines. RushCard CEO Russell Simmons has apologized publicly several times on behalf of the company, which has offered to waive debit card fees through February 2016. The company also says all lingering issues with customers have since been resolved. A RushCard spokesperson told Yahoo Finance the company is cooperating with the CFPB. However, in early December the CFPB said RushCard \u201chas been unable to deliver on its pledges of cooperation\u201d throughout the agency\u2019s preliminary investigation. The revelation was made in a letter denying RushCard\u2019s request to dodge certain requests for documents and information regarding the glitch\u2014requests the company argued were burdensome.\n\nDiscover Bank refunded 100,000 customers $16 million for illegally inflating their student loan bills and misleading them about benefits\n\nView gallery . Thinkstock\n\nAs if graduating with tens of thousands of dollars of student loan debt \u2014 which, sadly, is the new normal \u2014 wasn\u2019t bad enough, graduates have to contend with student loan servicers that don\u2019t always have their best interests at heart. In July, the CFPB ordered Discover Bank (DFS) and its affiliates to pay $16 million to customers for overestimating their minimum payment requirements and denying them key information on how to sign up for federal income tax benefits. As a result, borrowers got stuck paying interest on loans that should have been deferred. Some of those who weren\u2019t able to make the larger payments became delinquent on their accounts, incurring fees and late charges, while others had to cut out other expenses to cover the payments, the CFPB said. Others missed out on the student loan interest deduction tax credit. The refunds, which ranged from $92 to $500, were credited directly to borrowers\u2019 accounts.\n\nJPMorgan Chase was ordered to pay over $200 million in restitution and fines for selling bad credit card debts and robo-signing court documents\n\nView gallery .

But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) got in hot water with the CFPB and attorneys general in 47 states in July after revelations that the company had sold bad debts to buyers. For example, some debts had actually been settled already, or had been proven by the customer to be fraudulent. JPMorgan also sold debts that contained incorrect balances and other accounts that belonged to deceased borrowers. Even though it was the third-party collectors going after borrowers for bad debts (often through litigation), JPMorgan was on the hook because it knowingly sold the bad debts in the first place, the CFPB alleged. Of the $200 million JPM was ordered to pay, $50 million was earmarked for customer refunds.\n\nPayPal misled customers into signing up for lines of credit they never wanted\n\nIn May, PayPal (PYPL) was ordered to refund $15 million to customers and pay a $10 million fine after the CFPB found the company had illegally signed people up for unwanted credit. Many who thought they were signing up for regular PayPal accounts unwittingly registered for lines of credit through the company\u2019s lending arm, according to the CFPB. Some people only found out when they started getting debt collection notices for past due amounts or found evidence of the new account on their credit report.\n\nIf you want to file a complaint with the CFPB, submit one here >\n\nMandi Woodruff is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and host of Brown Ambition, a new podcast about career and finance.\n\nRead more:\n\n22-year-old blows her $90,000 college fund and blames her parents\n\nThe most inspiring personal finance stories of 2015\n\n9 little known Amazon Prime perks", "Bournemouth boss Howe slams FFP rules": "AFC Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has criticised the Football League's Financial Fair Play rules, claiming the current regulations will prevent the rise of smaller clubs.\n\nThe south-coast side have enjoyed a dream rise from the brink of financial ruin in League Two to the Premier League, climbing the divisions in just six seasons.\n\nHowever, Bournemouth - co-owned by Russian businessman Maxim Demin - are facing \"a financial sanction to be finalised in due course\" having exceeded the maximum permitted deviation of \u00a36million from a combination of adjusted losses and shareholder investment in their submission for 2014-15.\n\nBournemouth have beaten Premier League heavyweights Chelsea and Manchester United in their first season in the Premier League, but Howe believes the threat of FFP punishment will prevent smaller clubs from following their lead.\n\n\"If you go back through the history of football there will be great stories where teams have achieved great things from an owner or a benefactor or whatever you want to call it. They have enabled that side to push onto great things,\" Howe said.\n\n\"What the FFP structure will do is stop the underdog, the smaller team having the chance to succeed and I do not think anyone will want to see that - the rich get richer and the smaller clubs struggle to compete.\n\n\"It is a very delicate balance and something football needs to think about before anybody goes in a certain direction.\"\n\nHowe stated that Bournemouth, whose Vitality Stadium has a 11,464 capacity, have to spend above their means to achieve success.\n\n\"We have got an ambitious owner, we've an ambitious club that want to move forward.

Owned by just 9.4% of teams in this tournament, he cost only $17 and was the No. 1 scoring back. Hightower\u2019s resurgence continues to amaze, as he\u2019s gone from not having played a snap since 2011 to recording at least 27 carries in two of his past three games. At $20 and facing a Falcons defense that\u2019s allowed the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing running backs this season, Hightower is again an intriguing option in Week 17.\n\n[Yahoo Daily Fantasy: $10 could win you $20K in our $200K contest for Week 17]\n\nThe winning entry benefitted greatly from the shootout in New Orleans, as it stacked Blake Bortles, Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns to go along with Hightower and Brandin Cooks. Bortles shrugged off a slow start and threw for 368 yards with four touchdowns (and a two point conversion), finishing as the No. 2 scoring quarterback. Robinson, Hurns and Cooks combined for 21 catches, 380 receiving yards and four touchdowns. The 90-yard TD connection from Bortles to Robinson was the key play of the week for the winner.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurns, who hauled in two scores, was surprisingly owned by just 7.1% of teams despite costing a modest $24 and facing a Saints defense that\u2019s now allowed the most passing touchdowns in NFL history (43) with a game left to play. Hurns is up to 10 TDs on the year. Robinson, Hurns and Cooks each finished in the top-five in scoring among wide receivers in Week 16. New Orleans has allowed the most fantasy points to quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends this season, so stacking Falcons in Week 17 makes sense.\n\nWith LeSean McCoy out, Karlos Williams was an intriguing play at just $18, although owners got a scare when Mike Gillislee got the start. Williams totaled 97 yards with a touchdown and is averaging 5.7 YPC during his impressive rookie campaign. He again looks like a bargain in Week 17 at $23, although Williams gets a tough Jets defense that\u2019s ceded the second-fewest fantasy points to opposing backs this year.\n\nThe Texans at $11 was another key addition to the winner\u2019s lineup, as they scored 22.0 points thanks to four turnovers and a score. Meanwhile, David Johnson was owned by 56.9% of teams, but it was surprising that number wasn\u2019t even higher with his $21 price tag (it\u2019s up to $30 in Week 17). He had another big game, totaling 127 yards with a touchdown (it could\u2019ve been even bigger had he not sat out the fourth quarter thanks to the lopsided score).\n\nThis week\u2019s winning entry featured the No. 1 scoring back, the No. 2 scoring quarterback and three wide receivers ranking in the top-five.

Sure, you'll want to keep a significant equity portion of your portfolio to boost potential gains, but you won't have as much time as younger workers to make up lost ground if the market sinks. A conservative rule of thumb is to keep a percentage of stocks equal to 100 minus your age. If you're 60 years old, that means keeping 40% of your investments in stocks and putting the rest in bonds or money market accounts. More aggressive investors will sometimes use \"110 minus your age,\" instead.\n\nWith just five years to go in your full-time job, it's not too late to get a realistic retirement budget together. On the income side of the ledger, figure out how much you'll reasonably be able to count on from savings, Social Security and 401(k)s, and if you're lucky, a traditional pension plan. Then total your expenses.

For those with moderate net-worth, long-term care insurance is often a good idea, even so, it can cost several hundred dollars a month. There are several online tools that can help provide an estimate based on your age, the state you live in and other factors.\n\nCreating a budget can help you make minor adjustments to your retirement plan that could make a big impact later. If you forecast a deficit, you may need to work a year or two longer, but at least you'll feel more secure in your golden years.\n\nIn reality, making decisions about where to put money and whether to buy insurance gets complicated. Often, it's a good idea to talk with a knowledgeable financial adviser who can help you understand your options and chart the best course forward. Even if a consultation costs a few hundred dollars or more, sound advice can help put you on solid footing for the next phase of your life and provide peace of mind.\n\nOf course, even those who prepare diligently for retirement will occasionally need some additional income after their primary career is over. Maybe you're planning to work part-time in a different field.

If the scanner discovers a lump on the passenger that could represent a weapon, the machine shows a yellow box on the screen avatar, indicating where the lump has been spotted.\n\nOn social media sites like Twitter, news of the new TSA policy sparked a debate over whether the change would make air travel safer or lead to racial profiling.\n\nTo read more about travel, tourism and the airline industry, follow Hugo Martin on Twitter at @hugomartin.\n\nALSO\n\nWorker salaries are poised to climb in 2016\n\nUnited Airlines makes changes to program for children flying alone\n\n16 things travelers should know before planning their 2016 adventures", "NFL playoff picture: Broncos clinch, Colts still alive": "\n\n\n\nUpdated standings | AFC | NFC | Eliminated teams\n\nIf the season ended now:\n\nAFC first-round byes: (1) Patriots; (2) Broncos\n\nAFC wild card: (6) Jets at (3) Bengals; (5) Chiefs at (4) Texans\n\nNFC first-round byes: (1) Panthers; (2) Cardinals\n\nNFC wild card: (6) Seahawks at (3) Packers; (5) Vikings at (4) Redskins\n\nOnly two playoff spots remain as the regular season enters its final week.\n\nThe Denver Broncos claimed an AFC postseason berth by beating the Cincinnati Bengals and knocked the Bengals out of the running for the No. 1 seed.

(AP) -- Rex Ryan vowed the Buffalo Bills would have a ground-and-pound running attack.\n\nLittle did the first-year coach expect it was going to feature Mike Gillislee doing his best LeSean McCoy impression.\n\nWith McCoy sidelined by a right knee injury, Gillislee and rookie Karlos Williams ran over the Dallas Cowboys in a 16-6 win on Sunday.\n\n''Absolutely terrific,'' Ryan said. ''You've got a Pro Bowl running back out, and these two men step in and do a tremendous job for us.''\n\nGillislee had 93 yards rushing, and sealed the win by weaving his way up the right sideline to score on a 50-yard touchdown run with 2:25 remaining. Williams also scored on a 1-yard run as the NFL's top-ranked running attack combined for 236 yards despite missing numerous regulars.\n\n''I always had this confidence,'' said Gillislee, who spent his first two seasons in Miami before landing on Buffalo's practice squad this year. ''It was a matter of opportunity, and the Bills gave me that an opportunity.''\n\nAnother rookie, linebacker A.J. Tarpley, also had a hand in the win. Filling in for injured starter Nigel Bradham, Tarpley sealed the victory by forcing Lucky Whitehead to fumble on the kickoff return that followed Gillislee's touchdown. Tarpley also had an interception.\n\nBuffalo (7-8) snapped a two-game skid and won for just the second time in six games in a matchup between two teams already eliminated from playoff contention.\n\nThe Cowboys (4-11) continue to slide without injured quarterback Tony Romo. Kellen Moore lost in his first career start, as Dallas dropped to 1-10 in games without Romo.\n\nThe Cowboys also played without receiver Dez Bryant (ankle, foot injury).\n\nDan Bailey had two field goals for the Cowboys, who have scored just 22 points in their past five games.\n\n''We certainly need to get better offensively,'' coach Jason Garrett said. ''We did a good job of running the football at different times. But, we weren't able to sustain drives.''\n\nMoore went 13 of 31 for 186 yards with an interception. Darren McFadden ran for 99 yards.\n\nThe game was decided after the Bills ate up more than 4 minutes of the clock. Facing second-and-5 at midfield, Gillislee took a handoff to the right and got key blocks from guard Richie Incognito and receiver Chris Hogan.\n\nBills starter Tyrod Taylor went 13 of 18 for 179 yards and an interception.\n\nThe Bills went ahead for good on Dan Carpenter's 32-yards field goal with 6:17 left in the third quarter.\n\nWith the game tied at 6, Taylor blew a chance to put Buffalo ahead before halftime. Facing third-and-1 at the Cowboys 4 with 8 seconds left, Taylor underthrew a pass intended for Hogan at the right sideline of the end zone, and was easily intercepted by Deji Olatoye.\n\nIt was only Taylor's sixth interception of the season.\n\nThe victory took the heat off Ryan, who was facing a large share of criticism for Buffalo being eliminated from playoff contention for a 16th straight season - the NFL's longest active drought.\n\nAnd it also sets up an intriguing showdown in the Bills' season finale in Buffalo next weekend. Ryan will be facing his former team, the New York Jets, who at 10-5 need a win to guarantee a playoff berth.\n\n''We're going to give them our best shot,'' said Ryan, whose Bills beat the Jets 22-17 at the Meadowlands in November.\n\nNOTES: Taylor had 67 yards rushing to up his season total 517, surpassing the single-season franchise record for yards rushing by a quarterback set by Doug Flutie (476) in 1999. ... Bills DT Marcell Dareus did not return after sustaining a neck injury in the second quarter. ... Cowboys S Barry Church broke his right arm.\n\n---\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL", "The Stew's MLB Year in Review: Our favorite homers of 2015": "You can measure home runs in a number of ways these days \u2014 distance, exit velocity, how many runs they brought home and how they impacted the game.

(Getty Images)\n\nIt's a blast a nation, and baseball fans everywhere, will never forget: Jose Bautista's home run in the Blue Jays' win in Game 5 of their ALDS against Texas was the exclamation point on the wildest inning we can remember and came complete with the most exuberant bat flip we can remember, too. The Blue Jays and Rangers were tied 3-3 in the seventh inning and with oh, about a dozen dramatic events leading up to this particular at-bat, Bautista drilled a middle-in Sam Dyson fastball into the second deck in left field for a three-run shot to put Toronto back in front 6-3 and they would hold on to advance to the ALCS.\n\nHaving been in the building to witness all of it, I don't think I'll ever experience another ballgame quite like that one. It was truly one of a kind, and Bautista's homer, especially that bat flip, will forever be remembered as the game's standout moment.

On the very first pitch thrown by Matt Harvey in Game 1, the free-swinging Escobar ripped it between Yoenis Cespedes and Michael Conforto and just kept running.\n\nEscobar whipped the Kauffman Stadium crowd into a frenzy, speeding around the bases in 15 seconds. It was a signature moment for a Royals team fueled by blinding speed and untamed aggression, and easily one of the most thrilling moments of the entire season.

He's just one hit away from No. 3,000, a magical number that virtually assures he'll make the Hall of Fame. This player is now 39, and recently missed a lot of playing time. There are questions about his ability to produce on the field. Some think he's done. Once upon a time, he was capable of leading the league in home runs. The last season he played, he hit just seven.\n\n[Related: Yankees choice: Best bullpen ever, or one excellent trade chip]\n\nThings are different this time up, though. On the first pitch he sees, that veteran briefly resembles his younger self. For his milestone 3,000th hit, the ball sails out of the park for a home run. The fans cheer him on, even though things haven't always been perfect. He embraces his teammates at the plate with a big smile.\n\nIt's a storybook moment. The type you only see in movies. A formerly great hero overcomes various obstacles in order to reach the spotlight one last time. While Hollywood might eventually make a movie about Alex Rodriguez, we have a feeling it probably won't be an uplifting film about how he notched his 3,000th hit. For any other player, it would have been an incredible moment. For A-Rod, it was just another reason to hate him.

But the club later revealed the ball landed on top of the video board and it would stay there (a glass case was later placed over it to protect it from the elements). How many other home runs this season needed to be preserved in such fashion? Not only was it the first home run ever to be hit on top of the video board, it was one of the most memorable postseason home runs in the history of the franchise because of the majesty of its flight and obviously because it helped expel a bitter rival from the playoffs. It also gave the Cubs their first ever postseason series victory at Wrigley.\n\n[Elsewhere: Have the Cardinals been rattled by fast-rising Cubs?]\n\nSchwarber will be only 23 throughout the 2016 season and he still doesn't have even 300 at-bats at the major-league level. He's certainly going to have to stop striking out so much (77 times in the regular season), but it's fun to imagine when and where he might hit the next bomb that broadcasters, television cameras and fans alike all lose track of as it fades into the sky.

Especially don\u2019t check your phone when starting pitcher Mike Bolsinger is floating 85 mph \u201cfastballs\u201d when Giancarlo Stanton is at the plate.\n\nI made that mistake while sitting at Dodger Stadium in early May during the first inning of a Dodgers-Marlins game. With my head buried in my phone, I looked up immediately as soon as I heard the crack from Stanton\u2019s bat. As soon as I noticed left fielder Scott Van Slyke not budge from his position, I figured it would be gone.\n\n[Related: The Stew's MLB Year in Review \u2014 Best social media moments]\n\nBut not gone. I\u2019ve been to my share of games at Dodger Stadium and even the home runs that are crushed; you never think they are actually leaving Chavez Ravine. Stanton\u2019s 475-foot blast put him in the likes of an exclusive club featuring Willie Stargell, Mike Piazza and Mark McGwire as the only players to hit a ball out of Dodger Stadium in a game.\n\nAs for Bolsinger, who would go on to settle down and defeat the Marlins 11-1, he had the right attitude about the historic blast.\n\n\"That's the hardest ball I've ever seen hit against me \u2026 well, I take that back. His last ball he hit against me was probably the hardest ball,\" Bolsinger said. \"You've got to just look back and go, \u2018That's awesome,' and just go on with the game.\"\n\nGo on with the game without those darn cellular distractions.

If you can put up with a few of the warts \u2014 Chris Berman's \"back, back, back\" routine, mostly, but the bloated schedule too \u2014 the Derby has always been a treat for people who just want to see balls fly out of the stadium. (You don't want the crunchberries-only box of Cap'n Crunch every day, but it's cool once a year).\n\nAll that being said, I was still very much delighted to see the Derby's revival this season with a new format that bred new excitement. At the center was Todd Frazier, the then-Cincinnati Reds star who would win the competition on his home turf. That's fun and all, but really won was the new format. Pitting contestants head-to-head in a timed bracket format made for a new kind of drama, one that Frazier thrived upon\n\nTo win the competition, he tied Joc Pederson at the end of regulation then tie what amounted to a walk-off homer in bonus time to win the competition. It was thrilling, it was fun, it was memorable \u2014 and it was exactly what the Home Run Derby needed to recapture some of its past glory.\n\nPREVIOUSLY IN OUR YEAR IN REVIEW:\n\n\u2022 Best Social Media Moments\n\n\u2022 Best Fan Moments\n\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nMike Oz is the editor of Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports.

He was jumping all over the place cageside on Dec. 12 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas when, in a mostly empty arena, his pal, Court McGee, was fighting Marcio Alexandre.\n\nView gallery . Chuck Liddell retired in 2010 after being knocked out in his final three fights. (Getty Images)\n\nBut it was packed by the time Luke Rockhold walked to the cage at UFC 194 later that night to challenge Chris Weidman for the middleweight title. It made no difference, though, as Liddell, a close friend of Rockhold's, kept jumping from his seat, throwing his arms in the air, and expending almost as much energy watching, it seemed, as he did in some of his famous knockouts.\n\nOn Tuesday, it will be five years since Liddell announced his retirement as an active fighter and was named to a front-office position by UFC president Dana White. He loves the game as much as he ever did, and is a frequent presence at the major shows.\n\nHe's not certain if he'll attend UFC 195 on Saturday, when Robbie Lawler defends his welterweight title against Carlos Condit at the MGM Grand Garden, but he'll be sure to be watching.\n\n\"I just love the fights,\" Liddell said.\n\nWhite, his close friend, had to plead with him to retire because he so loved to compete. He was knocked out in his final three fights but still wanted to go on.\n\nHe loved it so much that on Monday, discussing the five-year anniversary of his retirement with Yahoo Sports, he said with a straight face that he even loved cutting weight.\n\nIf there is one thing a diverse group of fighters who hail from every continent can agree upon, it is that cutting weight sucks. There is nothing like it, and most despise it intensely.\n\nLiddell, though, is so passionate about fighting that he liked cutting weight, because of what it represents.\n\n\"\u2026 When I started to do that,\" Liddell said, \"I knew that it was the final thing I had to do before I got to fight.\"\n\nThe sport has changed much in the five years since he retired. For one, women are now competing in the UFC, which wasn't the case during his career.\n\nMore significantly, though, is that fighters are now entering the sport as mixed martial artists, and not as, say, a wrestler learning how to put it all together later.\n\nLiddell was the biggest star in the UFC during his day, and his bouts with Tito Ortiz and Randy Couture helped push MMA toward the mainstream.\n\nThe biggest stars in the sport today are featherweight champion Conor McGregor and former women's bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey. They're each great fighters in their own right, but they're also as popular for what they do outside of the cage as for their work in it.\n\nMcGregor's quick wit and penchant for trash talk have enabled him to steal the headlines and stand alone at the top of the heap in terms of widespread appeal.\n\nHis gift for gab can, at times, obscure the fact that as a fighter, he's pretty damn good. He knocked out long-time champion Jose Aldo in just 13 seconds in their bout at UFC 194.\n\nThat earned Liddell's respect, even if he's not crazy about the trash talk.\n\nView gallery . Liddell thinks Ronda Rousey should look at what went wrong in her loss before she decides when to fight next. \u2026\n\n\"I'll be honest: I don't like the way Conor talks. I'm not a fan of that. I get it. I understand it. It's his way of intimidating guys and getting into their head. Everyone has their way of trying to get into the other guy's head before a fight, and talking is his way. I don't like it, but I can put up with all the loudmouth, crazy things he says when he goes out and fights like he does and gives you those kinds of finishes.\"\n\nRousey has been a great finisher in her career before being stopped herself by the most famous head kick in the sport's history on Nov. 13, when she was knocked out by Holly Holm.\n\nWhite said he is planning the rematch for UFC 200, which many have said is too soon for Rousey to come back.\n\nLiddell said he hasn't spoken to Rousey and isn't certain of what her next move should be.\n\nHe pointed out that he was able to turn the tables in a rematch after a loss in a first fight. Liddell was stopped by Couture at UFC 43 on June 6, 2003. He then came back to stop Couture at UFC 52 and UFC 57.\n\nHe only watched the tape of his loss to Couture once, and that came in his camp for UFC 52.\n\n\"I watched it and I said, 'Oh, OK, I see what was going on there,' and I knew I could beat him,\" Liddell said. \"As for Ronda, it's hard for me to say. I haven't talked to her and I'm not in her camp.\"\n\nHe said Rousey should make an honest self-assessment of what went wrong before deciding upon her future.\n\nHe said he wouldn't arbitrarily rule out a rematch, if he was Rousey, but he wouldn't rush into it, either.\n\n\"Only she knows what was in her mind and if it was just a bad night that she can easily fix, or whether her confidence was shaken,\" Liddell said. \"It looked to me like she went out there with the idea that she would try to box with Holly, which her coach [Edmond Tarverdyan] said she could do, and she got hurt early. That will affect what comes after.\n\n\"If she thinks it's just a situation where she messed up and she'll be able to make the changes that will make a difference, go ahead. But if her confidence is shaken and there are any doubts at all in her head, she should take a fight against someone else first. There's no right answer, so to speak. It's about what is in her head.\"\n\nLiddell said he's excited to see Lawler-Condit on Saturday. Lawler is probably the closest thing to Liddell there is in the UFC, and he's coming off an epic victory over Rory MacDonald in what Liddell concedes is one of the greatest fights in the sport's history.\n\nLiddell isn't about to designate Lawler-MacDonald at UFC 189 as the greatest fight ever, but he said it deserves consideration.\n\nLawler joined the UFC in 2002, when Liddell was one of the sport's biggest stars. Much was expected of him at the time, but it took him years to fully live up to those great expectations.\n\n\"He was always a really good fighter and a fun guy to watch,\" Liddell said. \"But he kept working at it and plugging away at it. He matured and one day everything clicked, and boom, there he was on top.\n\n\"It's not like it was a fluke or anything. He's proven himself time and time again, and when you're fighting the best guys in the world all the time, you never know what is going to happen.\"\n\nThe only thing we know for sure is not to expect to see Liddell inside the Octagon again. He's thought about it plenty of times, but said he's never really come close to a return.\n\n\"I'm a fighter, and I'll always be a fighter, and it's what I love to do,\" he said. \"There were times I thought about [coming back], but never to the point where I picked up the phone and asked Dana to get me a fight. But I definitely miss it. I'll always miss it. That's never going to go away.\"\n\nMore MMA coverage:", "Kyle Busch hosts a NASCAR Christmas Party": "[Scene: 2015 Sprint Cup champion Kyle Busch hosts a Christmas party at his house to help celebrate his title.

Does your TV not work?\n\nMichael Waltrip: No, it's worse than that, Kyle. Rebecca is sitting next to Chip on the couch and they're getting all flirty. I don't think she likes me any longer.\n\nKyle Busch: Why don't you go outside and play some basketball.\n\nMatt Kenseth: Yeah, you can take my spot, I just got kicked out of the game by Brian France.\n\nKyle Busch: What happened?\n\nMatt Kenseth: He thinks I committed a flagrant foul against Logano. But I thought we were playing no blood no foul. He's not bleeding!\n\nDenny Hamlin: Ow, guys, I'm out too. I think I tore my ACL.\n\nKyle Busch: Again? Do you have any ACLs left to tear?\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr.: Is Gordon coming to this thing?\n\nJimmie Johnson: No, he's at the beach. He offered to send Chase Elliott in his spot but he's not old enough to drink. And the whole NAPA thing would probably send Waltrip into a tailspin at this point. It's a good thing he's not here.\n\nBrian France: I have declared Brad Keselowski and Joey Logano the winners of the basketball tournament. They are my favorite drivers in NASCAR and I will do anything to let them win in 2016. Let's eat.\n\nKyle Busch: Thanks for coming, everyone. May you all have a Merry Christmas ... KURT! I told you not to eat the brown things next to the M&Ms!\n\nKurt Busch: But they looked good.

It wasn't much better when it returned, scoring its only goal with three seconds remaining in a 2-1 home loss to Carolina.\n\nThe offense provided plenty of pressure by outshooting the Hurricanes 36-27, but the Blackhawks had trouble burying quality chances and often were out of position when it came to second-chance opportunities.\n\n''I counted about six chances that were either empty net or potential empty-nets that we either misfired or didn't bear down or weren't hungry enough,'' Quenneville said. ''We have to get greasier goals.''\n\nThere hasn't been much consistency with Quenneville's groupings, though, outside of Patrick Kane, Artem Anisimov and rookie Artemi Panarin making up the second line for most of the year.\n\nFirst-line center Jonathan Toews has 11 goals and 11 assists often playing with Marian Hossa, but both have gone through lulls with a constantly rotating linemate on the left wing.\n\nQuenneville held a longer-than-usual practice Monday and had Andrew Shaw on the top line in place of Teuvo Teravainen, who lasted roughly a week with Toews and Hossa and is now back on the third line. He indicated that the play on the ice will determine how long the change will lasts.\n\nOn defense, rookie Erik Gustafsson has been called up and David Rundblad - a healthy scratch for the majority of the season - has been placed on waivers.\n\nWhile those moves are designed to create a spark, the quick turnaround could benefit Chicago even more. The Blackhawks are just 2-4-0 when having three or more days off, and they'll also have one day between games before visiting Colorado on Thursday.\n\n\"I think everyone was well-rested, so that should be to our advantage,\" Hossa said Sunday after missing the previous two with an upper-body injury. \"Obviously, we didn't take advantage. This game, we should've played a little different. We didn't have enough bodies going to the net and sacrificing to get the ugly goals.\"\n\nArizona (17-15-3) hasn't exactly been lighting up the scoreboard during a 3-0-1 stretch, but they're getting positive results. Michael Stone tied it in the third and Mikkel Boedker scored in overtime in Sunday's 2-1 win over Colorado.\n\nBoedker assisted on every goal in a 4-3 overtime loss to Los Angeles the night before.\n\n\"He's scored overtime goals, he's had a few of them, so you expect him to be around it,\" coach Dave Tippett said. \"It's one thing to get the chances, it's another thing to capitalize, and that's what he's done. He's capitalized on his chances.\"\n\nAnders Lindback made 37 saves and earned another start over Louis Domingue. The two are sharing duties with Mike Smith out up to another eight weeks with a core muscle injury.\n\nLindback has lost his last three starts against Chicago with a 4.69 goals-against average and likely will oppose Corey Crawford, who is 2-1-1 with a 2.18 GAA in his last four against the Coyotes.\n\nChicago has won six of the last seven meetings in Arizona, including the playoffs.", "Hughes ready for more Shaqiri magic": "Xherdan Shaqiri's superb double helped Stoke City to a stunning comeback win against Everton, and left his manager Mark Hughes predicting even bigger things to come.\n\nThe Switzerland international caught the eye with a sublime performance in Monday's 4-3 Premier League win at Goodison Park, scoring twice - although there was some debate as to whether he meant the second.\n\nShaqiri gifted Stoke an early lead with his first goal for the club since his pre-season transfer from Inter, before doubling his personal tally when he stretched out his right boot to divert the ball over goalkeeper Tim Howard.\n\nIt was arguably his most influential display in a Stoke shirt, and Hughes expects him to push on from here.\n\n\"It takes time to understand what it is required at Premier League level. It doesn't matter what level you have played at before, the Premier League is a big ask,\" Hughes told BBC Sport.\n\n\"The only thing lacking up until today for Shaqiri was goals. Performances had been fine, but now he has added goals.\n\n\"He has that quality. It's his first mark in terms of goals and I'm sure there will be more to come.\"\n\nMonday's win came just two days after Stoke's 2-0 victory over Manchester United and Hughes was delighted to see his side continue their momentum - although they did it the hard way after Romelu Lukaku levelled twice and then Gerard Deulofeu put Everton ahead with 19 minutes left.\n\nJoselu made it 3-3 before Marko Arnautovic scored from the penalty spot in injury time, and Hughes added on Sky Sports: \"It was a great game, it ebbed and flowed and it was a game of chances.\n\n\"Towards the end there were a few tired minds and that's when mistakes are made.\n\n\"It was important that we backed up the win against United and we did that. We'd got into a winning position and then we lost the lead and we could have been disappointed with that but we weren't\u2019t to be denied.\n\n\"When we got on level terms you sensed there might be more there for us.\"\n\nArnautovic won the game after being fouled inside the area by John Stones and Hughes felt referee Mark Clattenburg had got the penalty decision right.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think the lad [Stones] got any contact on the ball, that's the debate,\" he continued. \"If he did get the ball it was the faintest of touches, but he certainly made more contact with Arnautovic.\"\n\nShaqiri, meanwhile, was delighted to have opened his account for Stoke.\n\nWhen asked about his second, which sparked some debate on social media as to whether he was intending a cross, he told reporters: \"It's a beautiful goal and an important goal for the team. The ball was good and deep from Bojan and the finish was good too.\n\n\"I really enjoyed looking back at it on the TV but more important were the three points.\n\n\"I feel better game by game and you will see that on the pitch. I am really happy to have scored for Stoke.\"", "Miami's miracle, Butler's pick lead Plays of the Year": "CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Sometimes, games, seasons and championships were at stake. Sometimes, ordinary moments turned extraordinary in an instant. They were the kind of moments that made fans leap from their seats in disbelief and grab their phones to share the excitement.\n\nThe plays of the year.\n\nAn arbitrary list, for certain, but this much is not in dispute - 2015 was laden with spectacular moments that will be talked about for a long time to come.\n\nTake American Pharoah, opening his lead with every stride down the stretch of the Belmont Stakes on the way to becoming the Triple Crown winner that horse racing had waited nearly four decades to see.\n\nOr Georgia Tech winning only one football game in the Atlantic Coast Conference all season, that win coming on a blocked field goal return for a touchdown as time expired against Florida State.\n\nOr Michigan State keeping its national-title hopes afloat when rival Michigan fumbled a punt snap in the final moments and the Spartans ran it in for a score as time expired.\n\nOr even Matt Kenseth driving Joey Logano into the wall at Martinsville during NASCAR's Chase for the Sprint Cup, clear retaliation for a Logano move that Kenseth blamed for knocking him out of contention.\n\nAll scintillating moments - and they didn't even make this list.

Messi vs. Bilbao.\n\nBarcelona's brilliant Lionel Messi takes a pass on the right wing, and what happens over the next 13 seconds is spectacular even by his lofty standards. Messi dribbles down the wing, freeing himself from three converging defenders, darts into the penalty box, cuts past a fourth Bilbao player and fires a left-footed blast into the net as two more opponents look on helplessly.\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR7DY7B0oj4\n\n---\n\n9. Ovechkin from his knees.\n\nWashington's Alexander Ovechkin takes a pass near center ice at Madison Square Garden, splits two New York Rangers defenders and gets knocked to the ice. So as he's falling to his knees, the Russian star has enough wherewithal to get a stick on the puck and somehow fire it past Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist - and the whole play took only 3 seconds.\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2pjERKAc-8\n\n---\n\n8. Spieth's 3-wood to finish U.S. Open.\n\nThe 2015 U.S. Open will probably be best remembered by Dustin Johnson three-putting on the 72nd hole, but the shot Jordan Spieth made moments earlier was one of the best of his incredible year. Spieth struck a 3-wood from 284 yards into eagle range, settling for a birdie that put him one shot ahead of Johnson. Turns out, that was all Spieth needed, since Johnson three-putted to give the 21-year-old his second consecutive major.\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uho-CMkKpe4\n\n---\n\n7. Rodgers to Rodgers beats the clock.\n\nDown 23-21 with no time left, Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay needed a miracle to beat Detroit. And he delivered. Getting one untimed play after a penalty on the Lions extended the game, the Packers' quarterback took the snap, rolled left, was chased back to his right, then unfurled a pass that sailed about 68 yards through the air and ended in teammate Richard Rodgers' hands for a stunning win.\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0vVqStvh-8\n\n---\n\n6. Holly's kick heard 'round the world.\n\nRonda Rousey was unbeatable. Then again, everyone is until it actually happens. And unheralded Holly Holm erased Rousey's air of invincibility in an instant. With one swift left-footed kick that caught Rousey on the right side of the head, Holm won their UFC fight and became the women's champion of their sport - setting up a rematch coming in 2016 that should be one of the biggest events of the year.\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--gSHT5S6zs\n\n---\n\n5. Joey Bats' bat flip\n\nGame 5 of the American League Division Series, tie game, seventh inning. Who better than a guy who goes by ''Joey Bats'' - real name, Jose Bautista - to deliver? Bautista connected on a no-doubt, three-run home run that would eventually lift Toronto to a series-clinching victory over Texas, punctuating the hit by admiring the drive from the plate for a moment before flipping his bat in celebration.\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UdsVO7HaJg\n\n---\n\n4. Carli from midfield.\n\nHave a World Cup, Carli Lloyd. With the U.S. women's national team already up 3-0 early against Japan in the World Cup final, Lloyd got her hat trick in absurd fashion. She collected a ball around the center circle, took two dribbles and saw Japan's goalkeeper was inexplicably about 12 yards off the end line. Lloyd booted the ball high, getting just enough on it to reach the goal over the outstretched goalie's arm.\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBosyOJ3PIY\n\n---\n\n3. Steph off the dribble (twice).\n\nPoor Chris Paul. As if Stephen Curry didn't do enough on his way to winning the MVP and leading Golden State to an NBA title last season, he victimized Paul twice on the way to those achievements. The first comes when Curry is dribbling under the basket toward the corner, then goes behind his back twice as Paul falls to the floor - a victim to the misdirection. The other comes with Curry going between-the-legs and behind-the-back on the dribble, weaving around three Clippers. And in both cases, Curry made the ensuing jumper.\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHdahxlUPac and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NudiJUlxb10\n\n---\n\n2. Butler's Super Bowl moment.\n\nSeattle was a yard away from a touchdown that would have almost certainly given the Seahawks a Super Bowl win. New England's Malcolm Butler - an undrafted rookie signed as a free agent - changed all that. With the Seahawks electing to not give the ball to Marshawn Lynch and trying to score through the air Butler perfectly read a slant pass from Russell Wilson, and made the interception that clinched the title for the Patriots.\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7rPIg7ZNQ8\n\n---\n\n1. The Miami miracle.\n\nDid it count? Yes. Should it have? No. And did Duke score on the previous play? Miami says no, which only adds to the fun of this one. Duke gets a debated touchdown with 6 seconds left to take a 27-24 lead, then kicks the ball deep. After eight laterals, one knee down that would have ended the game but wasn't called and tons of controversy, Corn Elder takes the ball 91 yards into the end zone for a Miami victory. The Atlantic Coast Conference said a day later that it was suspending the officiating crew for two games, then later told Miami that some of the 23 penalties against the Hurricanes - including ones that led to Duke's debated go-ahead touchdown - shouldn't have been called. ''They'll talk about this game forever, I guess,'' Elder said. ''And they'll always say we won.''\n\nOn the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YXwuaniPoc\n\n---\n\nFollow Tim Reynolds on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/ByTimReynolds and his work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/tim-reynolds", "John Wall on All-Star Game voting: 'It's a joke'": "View photo . John Wall remembers the one about Raquel Welch and the buoys. (Getty Images) Kyrie Irving has played fewer minutes all season than Wall played in October.\n\n[Follow Dunks Don't Lie on Tumblr: The best slams from all of basketball]\n\nWall is fifth in NBA All-Star Game voting amongst Eastern guards, whilst Kyrie Irving is second. This no doubt rankles the Washington point man, and he didn\u2019t hold back after being informed about his still-pending status when it came to the fans\u2019 vote for the NBA\u2019s midseason sometimes-classic.\n\nFrom CSN Mid Atlantic\u2019s J. Michael:\n\n\"It's a joke\" Wall, who didn't make one mention of his strained right ligament in his knee, bruise on the same knee, high right ankle sprain and bone spur, told CSNmidatlantic.com after his 15th double-double. \"I played like horse[diddley-poo] the first month and a half but I still was averaging like 16 and eight. That's not bad numbers.\"\n\nThey are not. In comparison to the other backcourt competitors, Wall\u2019s overall numbers hold up as well.\n\nHe\u2019s averaging 19.6 points, 9.7 assists, and 2.1 steals a contest. All but the assists would serve as a career-high, and Wall could point to his league-leading 47 percent assist rate as evidence that his passing acumen (he averaged 10 assists per game last season) has hardly dimmed.\n\nDwyane Wade leads Eastern guards in voting, with Kyle Lowry coming in fourth behind Irving and Jimmy Butler. Irving has understandably played inconsistent basketball as he\u2019s returned from a leg fracture, shooting just 34 percent while dishing out just 12 assists in 86 minutes. Wall racked up that many assists by the time we took our dumb Halloween selfie.\n\nOf course, Irving\u2019s not the one that should be on trial here. The fans, who control the vote of the starting five, should be.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a cynic, you\u2019re fair to point out that, when healthy, Dwyane Wade and Kyrie Irving might be the two best guards in the NBA \u2013 and the fan vote is recognizing as much. Derrick Rose is having one of the worst if not the worst (now that Kobe Bryant has enjoyed a relative hot streak) 2015-16 of any high usage player, and he\u2019s just behind Wall at sixth in fan voting amongst guards.\n\nIt is and forever will be a popularity contest: Kyrie Irving played basketball on ABC last June, John Wall played on NBA TV last May.\n\nAnd, eh \u2026 so what?\n\nJohn Wall, providing something rather unfortunate doesn\u2019t happen, is not going to miss the All-Star Game. And unless someone like Rose is voted in as a starter, it\u2019s not great crime if a great player with a shorter 2015-16 resume is voted in ahead of a more deserving player. Just about everyone in the NBA was fine and dandy with Kobe being voted in even back when he was shooting 31 percent, even if the Kobester was taken aback by the initial returns, and this will hardly cause a groundswell of support to take the fan vote away.\n\nEspecially when NBA coaches \u2013 the ones who vote on the reserves \u2013 hardly care and often whiff badly on their own choices. Especially when the league itself goes out of its way to allow its fans the opportunity to vote via myriad options. The NBA was way ahead of everyone in letting fans vote online all the way back in the late 1990s, and in (almost) 2016 you can vote via Twitter or even text. I just voted for Jimmy Butler via text while scratching out this paragraph, and I never return texts.\n\nMost importantly, this is a basic cable exhibition played on a Sunday night in February. It might just be possible that fans prefer Irving\u2019s style of derring-do over Wall\u2019s. Even the most informed of NBA fan might just want to see Kyrie Irving play 18 minutes while John Wall plays 12.\n\nAny valuation that prefers Kyrie Irving\u2019s 2015-16 contributions above John Wall\u2019s would indeed be a joke. Fan voting for the All-Star Game, something that engages followers and encourages fanatics from all continents, is not.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nKelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Don't Lie on Yahoo Sports.

Instead of going driver-by-driver we're going to review teams this year. We're starting from the bottom of the standings and working our way up. It's time for Richard Petty Motorsports.\n\n\n\nDrivers (standings in parenthesis): Aric Almirola (17th), Sam Hornish Jr. (26th)\n\nHighlights: Almirola had three top-five finishes and six top 10s in 2015. He finished fifth at both Dover races and fourth at Richmond in the fall. He grabbed top 10s at Chicago, Charlotte and Phoenix. And all three of those were Chase races. It's just that Almirola wasn't in the Chase.\n\nHornish had three top 10s. He was sixth at Talladega in the spring and the other two were at road courses. He finished 10th at Sonoma and ninth at Watkins Glen.\n\nLowlights: Missing the Chase was going to be a lowlight for Almirola after making it in 2014 by virtue of winning the summer Daytona race. While he was once again a consistent fixture inside the top 20, Almirola didn't have enough top-tier finishes to make a serious run at the Chase without getting to victory lane.\n\nHornish simply couldn't come close to finding the consistency Almirola had. He had back-to-back 40th or worse finishes at Phoenix and Auto Club Speedway early in the season and was outside the top 30 after Martinsville following a 32nd-place run there. He never got any higher than 24th in the standings after that.\n\nOverview: Almirola is developing into a very consistent driver. He may not be flashy, but that's also possibly a product of not driving for a top-tier team. If RPM finds a little more speed, it's not crazy to think he'll sneak into the Chase in 2016.\n\n\n\nHornish's return to the Sprint Cup Series went so well that he's not back for a second year. His car wasn't funded for the entire season so RPM turned to Brian Scott in 2016. While sponsorship hasn't been announced, it's reasonable to expect Scott is bringing it to the team. He's been funded by his father's resort while driving in the Xfinity Series.\n\nIt's unreasonable to expect that Scott will contend for the Chase in 2016, though he has shown flashes of top-15 speed in his limited Cup starts so far. But we're also going to be realistic here. His sponsorship money is more important to the team than his ability to potentially make the Chase. Maybe the additional money at the team's disposal will be what Almirola needs to turn all those top 15s he accumulates into more top 10s.\n\nPrevious Reviews: Roush Fenway Racing, JTG-Daugherty Racing and Germain Racing, HScott Motorsports, Front Row Motorsports, BK Racing and Tommy Baldwin Racing.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nNick Bromberg is the editor of From The Marbles on Yahoo Sports.

The debt payment is for interest on general-obligation bonds.\n\nThis has investors worried about the commonwealth\u2019s \u201cCofina\u201d bonds, which are backed by sales taxes. The bonds were considered a safe investment when they were first issued a decade ago. As much as $17.5 billion are currently owed with Cofina bonds, according to data from Municipal Market Analytics.\n\nBut Cofina bonds are technically issued by a government-owned entity called Corporaci\u00f3n del Fondo de Inter\u00e9s Apremiante (Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation). Therefore, they aren\u2019t general-obligation bonds of the government.

You're always trying to grow and evolve and get better. You're trying to always do what you do at a high level and we'll continue to do that.''\n\nThe problems against the Bills were similar to the ones that led to many of the 10 losses in 11 games without Tony Romo, who was limited to four starts because he broke his left collarbone twice.\n\nView gallery Dallas Cowboys quarterback Kellen Moore (17) throws a pass against the Buffalo Bills during the seco \u2026\n\nKellen Moore, the fourth starter Dallas has used at quarterback, couldn't move the offense consistently. A defense that held up well most of the game faltered late in the fourth quarter. A special teams miscue ended any hope of a comeback.\n\nIn nine of their 11 losses, the Cowboys either led or were within a touchdown in the fourth quarter. They lost their first seven games without Romo, and even one win would have kept them in the NFC East race, which the Redskins (8-7) wrapped up by beating Philadelphia last weekend.\n\nWhen Dallas got a big play from the offense, letdowns on special teams or defense canceled it out. And one of the NFL's best defenses in takeaways a year ago was the league's worst this season.\n\nAgainst the Bills, the defining moment was Tyrod Taylor's third-down scramble to keep a drive alive deep in Buffalo territory, leading to a touchdown and a 10-point lead late in the fourth quarter.\n\n''I think we were doing a good job most of the game and I think it's been something that's been as issue for us all year, finishing games,'' linebacker Sean Lee said. ''We have to find a way, in the future, to put an end to that if we want to be a great defense.''\n\nView gallery Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor (5) scrambles as Dallas Cowboys defensive ends Greg Hardy (76 \u2026\n\nThe Buffalo game was meaningless because both teams were out of the playoff race. Washington's visit Sunday is the same because the Redskins have clinched after running off three straight wins since a loss to the Cowboys that temporarily gave Dallas hope.\n\nNow the hope is gone.\n\n''I just think it goes back to what we try to preach on a daily basis around here, be your best regardless of circumstance and prepare that way and play that way,'' Garrett said.\n\n''It's something that regardless of what our record is and what the record of our opponent is that we always try to emphasize and instill in everybody and that's the approach we'll take.''\n\nGarrett said Moore will make his second career start, and wouldn't say whether receiver Dez Bryant is finished for the season after sitting against the Bills. Bryant missed five games after breaking his right foot in the opener, and Garrett said the foot would undergo further evaluation Tuesday.\n\n''He'll see medical people, we'll see how functional he is, all of that,'' Garrett said.

Taxpayers can\u2019t get a charitable deduction from this type of donation (called a qualified charitable distribution, or QCD), but effectively they get the same tax break. That\u2019s because the QCD amount is subtracted from taxable income.\n\nThe new law had been a temporary measure that got extended annually by Congress for years. It lets spouses each donate $100,000 from their individual accounts toward a QCD, for a total of $200,000 a year.\n\nSome quirky rules apply to QCDs. For one, unlike regular charitable donations, QCDs must be in cash. So if you\u2019re planning one of these, contact your brokerage immediately to ensure there\u2019s still time to liquidate holdings and have the donation count. Here\u2019s more to know:\n\n\u2022 Donations from cash or money-market accounts. If you\u2019re writing a check yourself from your IRA account and sending it directly to the charity, the charity must cash the check before the QCD can be eligible for a tax break. So for a last-minute donation, you\u2019ll need to follow up with your brokerage to ensure the check has cleared.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true that the charity just has to receive the check,\u201d says Maura Cassidy, director of retirement products at Fidelity Investments. \u201cThe money has to come out of the account by December 31.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Gifts of less than $10,000 from non-cash investments. Your broker can liquidate holdings and send the money directly to the charity; the donation date is when the check is sent. Cassidy notes that in her company\u2019s case, the donation envelopes go directly to a postal facility by the Fidelity campus in Covington, Ky.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Contributions of $10,000 or more from non-cash investments. Your brokerage firm will have to liquidate the holdings and then mail you a check; you\u2019ll then have to post it and get confirmation that the charity has cashed it in time. Unless you\u2019ve got a personal courier, that might be difficult to do in the next two days.\n\nMore from Consumer Reports:\n\nConsumer Reports has no relationship with any advertisers on this website.

And remember this awesome belt from the Phoenix Coyotes, inspired by wrestling fans Jason LaBarbera and Keith Yandle? Both belts were handed out to the game MVP, who then handed it over to the next game MVP, and so on.\n\nThere are differences between those straps and the Hurricanes\u2019 new championship belt, which was awarded by coach Bill Peters to Andrej Nestrasil on Saturday and then subsequently given to defenseman John-Michael Liles. The Canes\u2019 belt has \u201cEst. 1997\" on it, for example. It has messages like \u201cTeam First\u201d and the cryptic \u201cP2W\u201d etched onto it. (No, it doesn\u2019t mean \u201cplay to win.\u201d)\n\nBut the main difference is that the Hurricanes have absolutely no [expletive] clue what the belt is supposed to represent, or why they hand it out.\n\nYou see, the Hurricanes already have an award for their game MVPs: The clich\u00e9d fireman\u2019s hat, which admittedly looks adorable when situated atop the mop of Eddie Lack:\n\n.@eddielack makes 35 saves and gets the #Canes fireman's helmet tonight! #CARvsCHI #Redvolution pic.twitter.com/Fc2LBsCEsQ \u2014 Carolina Hurricanes (@NHLCanes) December 28, 2015\n\nSo who gets the belt? Hurricanes website writer Michael Smith attempted to suss this out, speaking to Liles.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really narrowed down what the belt stands for. Given that I won it last night, the rumor is that it\u2019s for the best 35-year-old in the game. I pretty much locked that up,\u201d said Liles.\n\nAnd yet a 24-year-old player won it first.\n\n\u201cTherein lies the quandary, I guess,\u201d Liles continued. \u201cRight now it\u2019s a combination of, I believe, hardest working or laying it on the line or something. There\u2019s a lot of speculation going around.\u201d\n\nSmith asked Nestrasil, the aforementioned 24 year old, what the belt meant.\n\n\u201cThe fireman\u2019s helmet for me means work ethic. That should be a work ethic award,\u201d he said. \u201cThe belt, I don\u2019t know, someone who gets a hat-trick or wins the game. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nSo an early congratulations to the next recipient of the storied Carolina Hurricanes championship belt, a player we assume worked hard or laid it on the line or scored a hat trick or had the game-winning goal.

He had been scheduled to face Geje Eustaquio at ONE: Spirit of Champions in Manila on Dec. 11, but collapsed suddenly prior to weigh-ins and was rushed to hospital where doctors were unable to save him.\n\nRELATED > ONE Championship Fighter Dies Following Failed Weight Cut\n\nNot standing by and just accepting the tragedy, ONE has decided to ban weigh-cutting by dehydration for its fighters. ONE is \u201cinstituting a new set of regulations and policies governing the weigh-in procedures and contracted weight limits. The new program, which is the first of its kind for combat sports, is focused on athlete safety by introducing \u2018walking-weight\u2019 competition via multiple weigh-ins and tests before and during fight week, including three hours before an event begins.\u201d\n\nAthletes will now compete at their \u201cwalking-weight,\u201d which will be determined by a system that will track the fighter\u2019s weight on a regular basis throughout the period that the athlete is contracted to ONE.\n\nThe revolutionary weigh-in program was established after thorough discussions and recommendations by ONE Championship's medical and competition team, consisting of Chief Doctor Dr. Warren Wang, Chief Medical Advisor Dr. James Okamoto, Vice President Mr. Rich Franklin, Vice President of Operations & Competition Mr. Matt Hume, Global Athlete Services & Competition Director Mr. Richard Auty and China Athlete Services & Competition Director Mr. Vaughn Anderson.\n\n\u201cONE Championship has paved the way for MMA in Asia and we have always been at the forefront of innovation for the sport.

As a former MMA champion, I've been through the process of weight-cutting by dehydration countless times and I know first-hand how it affects an athlete physically.

Ninety minutes later, they announced the signing of Ryan Lindley.\n\nWhat it all means for Sunday's regular-season finale against Tennessee remains unclear.\n\nOn Monday, coach Chuck Pagano insisted he had not yet ruled out Andrew Luck, who has missed six straight games with a lacerated kidney and a partially torn abdominal muscle and that backup Matt Hasselbeck was doubtful after hurting his throwing shoulder in Sunday's 18-12 win at Miami. Third-stringer Charlie Whitehurst went on injured reserve Monday with an injured hamstring.\n\nThat left Stephen Morris, who was signed off Philadelphia's practice squad Dec. 24, as Indy's only healthy quarterback.\n\nThe two signings could be an indication that neither Luck nor Hasselbeck, the 40-year-old who has gone 5-3 as a starter this season, will be ready when the Colts' try to salvage their longshot playoff hopes. Indy (7-8) was off Tuesday and players and coaches were not available to comment.\n\nThe move for Freeman was expected after Pagano confirmed they had brought him in for a workout and acknowledged the team needed another quarterback. Freeman started 60 NFL games after being taken in the first round of the 2009 draft but he hasn't played in the league since 2013. He spent this season playing with the Brooklyn Bolts of the Fall Experimental Football League.\n\nIn five NFL seasons, Freeman threw for 13,724 yards with 80 touchdowns and 67 interceptions.\n\nThe 26-year-old Lindley was Arizona's sixth-round pick in 2012 and started six games in his first three seasons, including two last season with the Cardinals.\n\nBut he was released by New England before the season opener in September and has not yet played this season.\n\nIn nine career games, Lindley threw for 1,314 yards with two TDs and 11 interceptions.\n\nThings have been so bad for the Colts this season that they lost practice squad quarterback Alex Tanney when the Titans (3-12) signed him to the active roster and receiver Griff Whalen, their No. 1 emergency quarterback, when he was put on injured reserve last week.\n\nIndy also has promoted inside linebacker Amarlo Herrera to the active roster, signed guard Kitt O'Brien to the practice squad and put linebacker Josh McNary on injured reserve.\n\n---\n\nOnline:\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL", "Estimize \u2014 Nike\u2019s Lacing Up Earnings This Winter": "Nike (NKE) Consumer Discretionary - Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods | Reports December 22, After Market Closes\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Estimize consensus calls for revenue of $7.838 billion and EPS of $0.89, slightly more bullish than Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\n\nNike\u2019s long term growth will be driven by strong global reach, ongoing product innovations and an expanding direct to consumer business.\n\nDespite a strong U.S. dollar, Nike has offset pressure on margins with price increases, lower labor costs and a DTC strategy.\n\nWhat are you expecting for NKE? Get your estimate in here!\n\nBest known for its transcendent swoosh, Nike (NKE) is expected to report FQ2 2016 earnings on December 22nd. Although the retail industry has fluctuated, Nike has consistently beat analysts\u2019 estimates with share prices increasing 30% just this year. Poised for another solid report,the Estimize consensus calls for revenue of $7.838 billion and EPS of $0.89, slightly more bullish than Wall Street\u2019s estimates of $7.785 billion and EPS of $0.85. Compared to FQ2 2015, this represents a YoY increase in revenue and EPS of 6% and 20%, respectively. Despite its size and market share, Nike still manages to post above average growth rates, driven by a strong global reach, ongoing product innovation and an expanding direct to consumer (DTC) business. International markets have consistently generated more than half of all Nike\u2019s sales in any year. Given the strength of the dollar and foreign currency headwinds, there has been growing concern of dampened sales and margins. In spite of this, Nike is supporting healthy growth around the world. While a majority of Nike\u2019s currencies have weakened, global margins have remained unaffected, offset by rising average shoe prices, Nike\u2019s direct to consumer strategy and greater operational efficiencies.\n\nIn China, Nike is expected to revitalize growth supported by a greater demand for active wear. Nike continues to take proactive measures to improve distribution channels and DTC business in China. Despite China\u2019s economic woes, Nike has performed remarkably well and saw revenue increase 30% last quarter. That being said, Nike also expects to remain strong in Europe amidst a deceleration in soccer sales. Key sectors such as running, cross-training and basketball are expected to keep the company modest as they amplify their direct to consumer and merchandising. Given how well Nike performs on the global stage, the upcoming Eurocup and summer Olympics will help propel the company amid concerns of slowing growth. Long term, Nike is making investments to create sustainable and profitable manufacturing infrastructure. Automated manufacturing can help offset rising labor, production and material costs. Through increased manufacturing investments, Nike expects to improve margins, increase prices and transition away from wholesalers to DTC. A direct to consumer strategy minimizes the overhead costs of selling in brick and mortar stores or to wholesalers. A large portion of Nike\u2019s DTC business has been tied to the success of its e-commerce platform which has grown almost 50% in the past quarter.\n\nNKE data by YCharts\n\nAfter a strong calendar year, Nike appears to be bringing positive momentum into their fiscal Q2 earnings report. The outlook of the company is promising, supported by global share gains, an innovative product pipeline, price increases and direct to consumer expansion. Additionally, margins have remained healthy despite currency and economic turbulence around the world. In the end, Nike\u2019s positive momentum coming into their earning report has warranted a \u201cbuy\u201d rating amongst analysts.\n\n\n\nDo you think NKE can beat estimates? There is still time to get your estimate in here!\n\nPhoto Credit: Peter Fletcher", "Browns could bench Johnny Manziel for Christmas Eve partying video": "Yet another video of Johnny Manziel partying has emerged, this one apparently taken from Christmas Eve, that would appear to be the kind of thing the Cleveland Browns told him not to do.\n\nBusted Coverage posted the video \u2014 all 10 seconds of it \u2014 on its Instagram site showing Manziel appearing to drink Four Loko, an alcoholic energy drink, along with a friend, while dancing and rapping.\n\nBrowns head coach Mike Pettine hadn't seen the video when he spoke with Cleveland-area media on Monday, and he said that Manziel could be benched in the 2015 season finale and that the \"repercussions would be harsh\" if his quarterback is found to be in violation of his agreement with the team.

I'll have a discussion with him about it.\"\n\nThe team told Manziel previously it wanted no more social media videos of Manziel partying, and that appears to be exactly what this was. It's another embarrassment for Manziel and the team. He has had multiple incidents in Year 2 after he said he matured after a tumultuous rookie season.\n\nWorse still, the alleged partying happened hours before one Browns player and one former Browns player were arrested on multiple charges, including illegal possession of Adderall, drunk driving, speeding and a gun charge.\n\nManziel had been the star of a bye week video in which he rapped vulgar lyrics and was drinking at a club in Austin, Texas. He later was dropped from the starting lineup to the third string after he lied to the team about when the video took place.

Absolutely,\" Weeden said. \"We get to play extra football and he'll be watching on his couch. That's what it's all about. We're playing for something, and this is a fun time of the year.\"\n\nDuring Jones' weekly radio appearance on Tuesday on 105.3 The Fan, he said of Weeden, \"I'm really proud for him.\" He may have taken a swipe at his own coaching staff when he added, \"I\u2019m proud for Houston that they\u2019ve come up with a way to use him in a way that can win a game.\u201d\n\nWeeden was Tony Romo's backup at the start of the season, and the first to get starts after the first time Romo broke his collarbone, in Week 2. Without Dez Bryant, who had broken a bone in his foot in Week 1, Weeden put up some decent numbers (he completed 72 percent of his passes with Dallas) but the Cowboys were 0-3 with him as starter, though against New Orleans in Week 4, he led the offense to a game-tying touchdown only to see the defense give up an 80-yard touchdown on the second play of overtime.\n\nThe longer the team went without winning a game on Weeden's watch, the more critical Jones became. Before Weeden made his first start, Jones said Weeden was a \"gifted passer\", but after the loss to the Saints, Jones called Weeden \"limited,\" particularly in comparison to a quarterback like New Orleans' Drew Brees.\n\n[Yahoo Daily Fantasy: $10 could win you $20K in our $200K contest for Week 17]\n\nThen after benching Weeden for newly acquired Matt Cassel, Jones spoke of how aggressive the offense could be with Cassel (nevermind that Jones admitted coaches were asking Weeden to play conservatively): \"Weeden was so conservative, he was coached to be conservative to a degree, but he was not taking chances with that ball. Now, we know you can\u2019t make plays if you don\u2019t take some chances. So, we\u2019ll see more of that.

Coach Bill O'Brien has been complimentary of Weeden's professionalism, and Weeden appreciates how he's been welcomed in Houston.\n\n\"Obviously a lot of guys here got my back,\" Weeden told 107.7. \"Nate Washington said some really nice things after last week's win, which I really appreciated. Everybody here has got my back. They understand how the league works. I think they were just as shocked as I was with some of the things that maybe Jerry [Jones] or whoever was saying.

His right arm was fine.\n\nHe even returned to the field in street clothes to play with his children after the game.\n\nBrees passed for 412 yards and three touchdowns, and the New Orleans Saints beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 38-27 on Sunday.\n\nJust six days after tearing his plantar fascia, Brees said he remained in pain, but stressed, ''Once you get up to the line, you flip the switch and it's all about competing at a high level.''\n\nHis mobility was restricted, he said, but that only seemed to sharpen his focus in the pocket and make him more decisive. He completed 25 of 36 passes without a turnover.\n\n''Maybe the only thing you could draw a parallel to, or compare it to, is when you have one of your senses taken away, your other senses are heightened,'' Brees said.\n\nBrandin Cooks caught a 71-yard touchdown pass to highlight his 123 yards receiving, which gave him more than 1,000 yards this season. He said he expected Brees to play well after seeing his limited work in his return to practice Friday.\n\n''A guy like that, man, if he can walk, he's going to play,'' Cooks said. ''That's just what type of guy he is and I didn't have no other doubt for him to come out and have a great game.''\n\nRunning back Tim Hightower, who missed the previous three seasons because of a knee injury and subsequent complications, consolidated his recent resurgence with 122 yards and two touchdowns rushing for New Orleans (6-9).\n\n''I told the (offensive) line before the game, 'I'm going to give you all I got today. I'm going to give you every single ounce of energy I got and I need everything you got,''' Hightower said. ''They gave it to me.''\n\nNewly reacquired running back Travaris Cadet added a 44-yard TD catch.\n\nBlake Bortles passed for 368 yards and four TDs for Jacksonville (5-10), which was eliminated from playoff contention earlier Sunday by Houston's victory.\n\nBortles' TD strikes included a 90-yarder to Allen Robinson, who finished with 151 yards receiving. Allen Hurns caught eight passes for 106 yards and two touchdowns. But it wasn't enough to overcome an early 24-0 deficit.\n\n''It's tough. You get behind like that and you've got to do some different things game plan-wise,'' Bortles said. ''I don't really know what to tell you. We've got to find a way to be better in the first half.''\n\nBrees, who has missed only one game in the past 10 seasons, led New Orleans to points on four of the Saints' first five offensive series, starting with his 17-yard scoring pass to tight end Michael Hoomanawanui.\n\nThe record-setting quarterback still hasn't missed a snap since his injury during the second quarter of the Saints' loss to the Lions the previous Monday night, when he reached 4,000 yards passing in a season for an NFL-record 10th straight year.\n\n''We expected him to play. All we could go off of was the little bit we saw of Detroit,'' Jaguars coach Gus Bradley said. ''It didn't seem to hamper him at all.''\n\n''He just really executes,'' Bradley added. ''Sure enough, he did it again.''\n\nAgainst Jacksonville, Brees reached 31 touchdown passes for the season, his NFL record eighth straight with at least 30.\n\nIt also was Brees' 13th career 400-yard game, tying Hall of Famer Dan Marino for second in NFL history - behind only Peyton Manning's 14.\n\n''People might say we have nothing to play for as far as playoffs and such, but we have a lot to play for,'' Brees asserted.

Or, if he does care, he doesn't care to discuss it, doesn't have any interest in the knee-jerk pandering or uncomfortable discussions when two people who really, really do care start discussing some wedge issue without a solution.\n\nAll of which makes his presence on the cover of Wednesday's New York Daily News, the latest in the partisans on both sides demanding he definitively declare whether he loves/hates/endorses/condemns Donald Trump for President, so ridiculous\n\nView gallery .\n\nThat, though, isn't allowed by the politically obsessed, who insist Brady match their fixation with all things politics.\n\nBut not everyone approaches politics as they do.\n\n[Yahoo Daily Fantasy: $10 could win you $30K in our $300K contest for Week 15]\n\nIt isn't that the topics aren't serious or important. It's the tact, it's the anger, it's the certainty in their position. It's that this feels less about proving anything or convincing anyone and more about shouting over each other in an effort to claim some moral or intellectual high ground.\n\nIt may baffle those who are manic about politics but many of us out there look upon the entire thing not with a lack of understanding, but a belief in the clarity of our position \u2013 that this is mostly a dishonest construct, built to enflame passion so the governing/lobbying/campaigning class makes more money.\n\nSix of the 10 richest (by median income) counties in America surround Washington D.C., according to Forbes. This doesn't seem like a coincidence.\n\nMany Americans are exhausted just looking in on the clown show and uninterested in being labeled as an extremist by other extremists for not being extreme enough about whatever they deem extremely important.\n\nI don't know how Brady feels because like most political agnostics \u2013 or, you could say, independents \u2013 I'd never ask him because I have no interest in finding out. I bet he might agree, though. He sure acts like it.\n\nHe rarely expresses an opinion on anything other than how tough this week's defense looks and how much work he and the New England Patriots will have to work to score a touchdown. He was asked this fall by GQ Magazine about running for political office.\n\n\"There is a 0.000 chance of me ever wanting to do that,\" Brady said. \"I just think that no matter what you'd say or what you'd do, you'd be in a position where \u2013 you know, you're politicking. You know? Like, I think the great part about what I do is that there's a scoreboard. At the end of every week, you know how you did. You know how well you prepared. You know whether you executed your game plan. There's a tangible score.\n\n\"I think in politics, half the people are gonna like you and half the people are not gonna like you, no matter what you do or what you say,\" he continued. \"It's like there are no right answers. If there were, everyone would choose the right answers. They're all opinions.\"\n\n____________________\n\nIn September a Donald Trump trucker hat reading \"Make America Great Again\" wound up in Brady's locker in Foxborough. Brady said Patriots owner Robert Kraft gave it to him. He deemed it \"a keepsake.\"\n\nThe media asked about it, perhaps because it was unusual for anything like that to be seen around Brady. He's occasionally worn a T-shirt supporting an anti-hunger organization, or something like that, but that's about the extent of it. The man's brand is bland.\n\nView gallery . The furor started when a Donald Trump hat was spotted in Tom Brady's locker. (Twitter)\n\nFrom then on Brady would play golf on Trump's courses, sometimes with the flamboyant Donald, or stay at his properties or whatever. \"Fun guy to be around,\" Brady said.\n\nNone of this was an issue until Trump ran for president and built his campaign in a way that, based on the polls, both horrify and excite segments of America.\n\nWhen asked about Trump's political aspirations Brady explained their relationship and called him a friend. He said it would be great if Trump was president, but did it in a comical, non-serious way, noting it would mean a putting green would be built at the White House. (Never mind that there already is one.)\n\nTrump took that and began bragging that he had Brady's endorsement, which isn't what Brady said. Now Brady waded into a world where everything is blown out of proportion and there is never any context or perspective or appreciation for a guy getting cornered into a topic he didn't want to discuss.\n\nTo many, this was understandable. Not turning your back on a friend isn't the same as supporting every single thing he or she does, believes or says. It's clear that Brady has no interest in this.\n\n\"Can I just stay out of this debate?\" Brady pled Monday on WEEI's \"Dennis and Callahan Show.\"\n\nOf course not. This is the political-industrial complex, with the New York Daily reaching into the coffers by putting Brady on its cover, declaring he had no, ahem, \"courage\" for not condemning Trump. Later Wednesday, back in Foxborough, the last two questions of Brady's weekly news conference were about Trump and how much Brady thought about the newspaper cover.\n\n\"I don't think about it much,\" Brady said. \"It's a tough week, I've got a lot of football stuff to think about. Hopefully we can go out and beat the Titans. That would be the most important thing.\"\n\nThe politically obsessed from all sides are now screaming, probably because it's easy and a cheap score, not because there is any importance to the issue \u2026 a private citizen who has no interest in the endorsement game is refusing to make a definitive statement on his choice in an election that is months away.\n\nBrady isn't usually someone you might feel sorry for, but this enormous parade of nonsense can do it. He drew the worst seat ever at the holiday dinner table, stuck between the activist college student niece and tea party uncle.\n\nCan someone pass the green bean casserole? And how about them Patriots?", "PGA Tour widening gap in world ranking points": "European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley laid out ambitious plans with hopes of becoming a ''viable alternative'' to the PGA Tour.\n\nThat starts with an increase in prize money, and he went so far as to say that it would make more sense for the European Tour's flagship event to be the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai ($8 million purse) instead of the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth ($5 million purse) because of the money.\n\nAnother measure of the mountain he has to climb is the world ranking.\n\nThe gap continues to widen in the average ranking points for PGA Tour events compared with Europe - up an average of one point this year, two points from 2012.\n\nIncluding the four majors and the four World Golf Championships, the PGA Tour averaged 56.4 points for the winner compared with 42.2 points for the European Tour. That's a difference of 14.2 points, up from 13.3 points a year ago.\n\nThrow out the majors (each worth 100 points) and the WGCs, and the PGA Tour offered an average of 49.5 points compared with 32.9 points for the European Tour.\n\nThe European Tour had six regular events that offered 50 points or more, including the BMW PGA Championship, which is guaranteed 64 points as the flagship event. The PGA Tour had seven events that offered 60 points or more, including The Players Championship, which is guaranteed 80 points (The Players actually has a stronger field by raw numbers than three of the majors).\n\nThe four events in The Finals Series for the Race to Dubai offered an average of 53 points to the winner. The four FedEx Cup playoff events on the PGA Tour awarded an average of 68.5 points to the winner.\n\nPelley is aware he needs time to become a viable option, and his target is the next generation of players.\n\n''That's not going to happen necessarily in 2016,'' Pelley said last month in Dubai. ''You'll start to see it happen in 2017. You'll start to see it come to fruition in 2018. We definitely in three to five years will have a viable alternative, so that 17-, 18-, 19-year-old doesn't necessarily need to go to America to be able to make as much money as they possibly can.''\n\n---\n\nSETTING THE BAR HIGH: Jordan Spieth and caddie Michael Greller have made a bet each of their three years. Greller sets a number of times Spieth must hole out from off the green, and if he surpasses the number, Greller has to take him for dinner. Of course, Spieth gets to invite anyone he wants, and last year in San Diego there were about 20 guests on Greller's tab.\n\nBased on what he did last year, the new number for Spieth to beat is 20. Only it doesn't start next week at Kapalua.\n\n''He talked me into starting in Australia,'' Greller said, shaking his head.\n\nSpieth holed out with an 8-iron on the 17th hole at the Australian Open. A week later, Spieth made a hole-in-one at Albany Golf Club on his second hole of the Hero World Challenge.\n\nAlas, there was one sliver of good news.\n\n''He wanted anything over 100 yards to count as double,'' Greller said in the Bahamas. ''So it would be four if I had gone for that.''\n\nHoling out in the majors, however, still counts double.\n\n---\n\nHORSCHEL'S OUTLOOK: Billy Horschel wanted to be the first player to win the FedEx Cup in consecutive years. Not only did he fail to make it to the Tour Championship, he didn't make it back to Kapalua for the Hyundai Tournament of Champions.\n\nHorschel is known as a streaky player. He had a big run in the spring of 2013 when he won in New Orleans, and then had only four top 10s in his next 39 events. He had a great run in September 2014 when he won the BMW Championship and Tour Championship to capture the FedEx Cup, and he has had only three top 10s in 30 tournaments worldwide since then.\n\nHe thinks he knows the fix.\n\n''We played a lot with Jordan (Spieth), a lot with Zach (Johnson). We see them hit it 10 to 15 feet on average, and I'm hitting it 20 to 30,'' Horschel said. ''For me to be a more consistent player and have those runs last longer than a four- to five-week stretch, my short game and wedge play need to be more consistent.''\n\nHorschel said he has worked so hard on his short game the last few months that ''I'm sick of hitting wedges.''\n\n''If we look back at 2016, the reason I'll have had a great year is because I put in all the time on my wedge play, and it's a result of it,'' he said.\n\n---\n\nIT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING: Imagine if Rickie Fowler could blend his last two seasons.\n\nLast year was all about the majors. Fowler in 2014 joined Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus as the only players to finish in the top five at all four majors (Jordan Spieth did it this year). The only problem was Fowler didn't win any of them. In fact, he didn't win at all.\n\nThis year, he won a career-high three times - The Players Championship, Scottish Open and a FedEx Cup playoff event at the Deutsche Bank Championship. But the majors were somewhat of a bust. He shot 81-73 to miss the cut in the U.S. Open, and he finished a combined 37 shots behind in the other three majors.\n\nSo how do you have a year of big wins and big chances in majors?\n\n''No clue,'' Fowler said with a smile. ''I've been trying to figure that out. I don't think there's a justifiable answer. It's just timing, when you get hot. You can only prepare so much and be ready to play. But actually getting it to happen at the right time?''\n\nSo which year would he rather have? He was plenty happy with this one.\n\n''Holding trophies feels a lot better,'' Fowler said.\n\n---\n\nBACK TO TORREY? Adam Scott wants to play two times during the West Coast swing. One will be the Sony Open because Honolulu is on his way back from Australia. He loves Riviera, where he won in 2005 when it was reduced to 36 holes because of rain. Then again, Torrey Pines makes more sense because of the schedule. He could hang out in Hawaii an extra week and then tee it up the next week in San Diego.\n\nScott hasn't been to Torrey Pines since the 2008 U.S. Open. And he hasn't seen the North Course since he was a teenager.\n\nHe played the 1994 Junior World Championship and tied for 20th.

Over their collective shoulders are the New York Islanders (43 points) in third place, with the New Jersey Devils (39 points) and Pittsburgh Penguins (37) within striking distance.\n\nThere\u2019s no panic in the words of the players, but the fans would like to see some urgency \u2013 if not from the Rangers, then from Rangers management, which can\u2019t look at the way this team has played through 37 games and think it\u2019s anything but a playoff elimination waiting to happen.\n\nThey\u2019re 28th in the NHL in Corsi percentage at 46.7 percent, ahead of only Ottawa and Colorado. Their defense has hung Henrik Lundqvist out to dry like a used bathing suit on a Marriott balcony. They thrived on being one of the better counter-punch teams in the NHL for the first two months of the season, before they went counter-punchless.\n\nBut as Henrik Lundqvist, pulled again Monday night, said of the loss to the Preds: \u201cWe did a lot of good things. It was just a few minutes in the third, we get hurt big time. It\u2019s been the case in too many games now and it\u2019s extremely disappointing and frustrating.\"\n\nPat Leonard of the NY Daily News encapsulated what we\u2019ve seen from the Rangers in the last month, writing about their 5-3 loss to the Nashville Predators on Monday:\n\nVigneault\u2019s team resides in a dark place where mistakes regularly snowball into catastrophes. Derick Brassard\u2019s \u201ctotally unnecessary\u201d roughing penalty on Predators forward Miikka Salomaki (assist), in Vigneault\u2019s words, led to Forsberg\u2019s first-period goal. Kevin Hayes\u2019 now-patented play \u2013 a turnover followed by failing to get back on defense \u2013 gave Neal the go-ahead goal at 13:48 of the second.\n\nFrom Andrew Gross of Rangers Rants:\n\nThe Rangers continue to exhibit one of the most glaring weaknesses of a fragile team: When something goes bad, multiple things seem to go bad. The Rangers, trailing 2-1, caught a break when Filip Forsberg\u2019s apparent goal at 5:18 of the third period was overruled via a coach\u2019s challenge with Craig Smith in the paint interfering with Henrik Lundqvist. But the Predators still took a 3-1 lead at 7:34 and, in short order, that became a 5-1 deficit. The Rangers, playing for the first time since Tuesday\u2019s 3-2 overtime win over the Ducks, got off to a sluggish start as they found their legs but were playing better by the end of the first period and even better still in the second period. But it unraveled so quickly in the third period and that\u2019s just something that doesn\u2019t happen with this alarming frequency to good teams.\n\nSnowballs turning into avalanches. Two-goal deficits ballooning to four-goal holes in a blink. Such are the Rangers at the moment.\n\n\u201cFragile\u201d is a good term, too. The Rangers are still one of the best closers in sports: 14-0-0 when leading after two periods.\n\nWhen trailing after two periods this season? They\u2019re 0-10-1, one of only five teams that haven\u2019t rallied for a win yet this season. (The others? Colorado, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Toronto.)\n\nThe Rangers remain a team that, when they\u2019re on, can look like a champion. Problem is that they\u2019ve been \u201con\u201d for about 10 minutes a game over the last month. Otherwise, they\u2019re all waiting for that snowball to start tumbling down the mountainside.\n\n____\n\nGreg Wyshynski is a writer for Yahoo Sports.

(AP) -- The atmosphere inside the Kansas City Chiefs locker room wasn't a whole lot different Sunday than in any of their other victories during a franchise record-tying nine-game win streak.\n\nThere were high-fives and congratulations, of course. But mostly a business-like attitude.\n\nIt was hard to believe the Chiefs had just qualified for the playoffs.\n\n''We still have one more week left and there's still a lot to play for,'' said quarterback Alex Smith, who threw two touchdown passes in a down-to-the-wire, 17-13 victory over the Cleveland Browns.\n\nWhen Pittsburgh lost to Baltimore moments later, the Chiefs clinched at least a wild-card spot.\n\nThey can still win the AFC West and host a playoff game if they beat Oakland next week and the Broncos lose to Cincinnati on Monday night or in their regular-season finale against San Diego.\n\nHard to believe when they were 1-5.\n\n''We didn't panic, that's the most important part,'' Chiefs linebacker Derrick Johnson said. ''You can't get too far in the hole, and we got as far as you can get to still make the postseason.''\n\nThe Chiefs (10-5) jumped out to a 17-3 halftime lead Sunday, and looked as if they were cruising to an easy win. But their offense became listless over the final two quarters, just as Johnny Manziel was pumping some life into the downtrodden Browns (3-12).\n\nThe former Heisman Trophy winner led Cleveland to 10 straight points, then had them in possession for a go-ahead touchdown before his incomplete pass to the end zone on fourth down with 2:55 left.\n\nKansas City had a chance to put the game away, but failed to pick up a first down, and Cleveland took over at its 30 with 1:52 left and no timeouts. The Browns picked up three first downs, and Manziel hit Darius Jennings on fourth-and-10 from the 32 with time ticking away.\n\nIt ran out before Manziel could get off another snap, and he spiked his helmet in frustration.\n\n''I'm definitely shouldering a lot for this loss,'' he said. ''Regardless of what our record is, where we are in the season, it (stinks) not to win, especially when our coach and the other 10 guys put us in a position to try to get us in the end zone there at the end. I just felt like I didn't do the right thing in crunch time. I think that's the moral of the entire story of the game.''\n\nManziel threw for 136 yards with an interception, but he also ran for 108 yards to give his team a chance. Isaiah Crowell added 88 yards rushing and a touchdown for the Browns.\n\n''I talked earlier this week about planting seeds and moving forward,'' Browns coach Mike Pettine said. ''I think that second half was an indication. It's one of those, you look at the scoreboard, you lost. But in some sense you just feel like you ran out of time.''\n\nThe Chiefs looked as if they'd make this one easy in the first half, driving downfield for a TD on their opening drive. Smith zipped a pass to Jeremy Maclin between three defenders for a score.\n\nKansas City added a field goal moments later for a 10-0 lead.\n\nTravis Coons kicked the first of his two field goals for Cleveland, and an interception of Smith gave the Browns life. But two plays later, Manziel was picked by Marcus Peters, and the rookie returned his eighth of the season deep into Cleveland territory. Smith then connected with Travis Kelce with 32 seconds left to help the Chiefs take a 17-3 lead into the break.\n\nThen the Chiefs got stagnant. And the Browns made things interesting.\n\nHis scrambling ability was critical to a nine-play, 82-yard drive to begin the second half, and Crowell finished it by racing 10 yards for a touchdown.\n\nThen, after forcing a quick punt, Cleveland put together a grinding 21-play drive that took up more than 12 minutes despite going only 62 yards. Three times, Manziel picked up a first down by scrambling on third or fourth down, though his intentional grounding penalty helped force a field goal.\n\nThe Browns had twice more advanced deep into Kansas City territory. The final time came in the game's final seconds, when he couldn't get the ball spiked in time.\n\n''Johnny is one of those quarterbacks you can never get comfortable with him, Johnson said. ''For a defensive guy he's a headache. But at the end of the day, time ran out on him.''\n\nNOTES: Maclin became the fourth wide receiver under Andy Reid to eclipse 1,000 yards receiving. He has 1,034. ... Browns RB Raheem Mostert (ankle) and WR Marlon Moore (concussion) left in the second quarter and did not return. ... Smith threw for 125 yards, giving him a career-best 3,330 this season. ... The Chiefs only had 258 yards total offense.\n\n---\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL", "The Top 25 Baseball Stories of 2015 \u2014 #18: Baseball recommends extended protective netting": "We\u2019re a few short days away from 2016 so it\u2019s a good time to look back at the top 25 baseball stories of 2015. Some of them took place on the field, some of them off the field and some of them were creatures of social media, fan chatter and the like. No matter where the story broke, however, these were the stories baseball fans were talking about most this past year.\n\nAs I mentioned in the last entry, baseball tends toward incremental change. Sometimes, however, there\u2019s a single incident which serves as a watershed moment for the game, after which people simply think about long-accepted practices differently and which leads to change. We saw this a few years ago after Buster Posey\u2018s leg was broken in a collision at home plate, leading to new rules outlawing collisions with catchers. We likely saw another such moment when Chase Utley slid into Ruben Tejada during Game 2 of the 2015 NLDS.\n\nWith Enrique Hernandez on third base and Chase Utley on first and one out, Howie Kendrick hit a ground ball up the middle. Daniel Murphy, ranging to his right, corralled the ball and flipped to Tejada, who had to whip around to fire to first. Utley slid late and hard and took out Tejada, who couldn\u2019t make a throw. The Dodgers scored the tying run on the play. Tejada left the game with a broken leg, his season over. Utley\u2019s slide was clearly dirty. He didn\u2019t start his slide until he was parallel to the second base bag, and he never touched the base. His intent was clear: take out Tejada, never mind about reaching the bag.\n\nIn the wake of that play, momentum has built toward a rule change that will almost certainly be referred to as \u201cThe Chase Utley Rule\u201d when it is eventually adopted. It will likely be aimed at eliminating the sorts of hard slides into second base, the likes of which Chase Utley demonstrated. In reality, however, baseball already has a rule which could serve that purpose if it were ever enforced. It\u2019s Rule 6.05(m), which already says a baserunner is out when, in the umpire\u0092s judgment, he intentionally interfere with a fielder who is attempting to catch a thrown ball or to throw a ball in an attempt to complete any play. As the comments to the rule make clear, it is intended to outlaw \u201cdeliberate, unwarranted, unsportsmanlike action by the runner in leaving the baseline for the obvious purpose of crashing the pivot man on a double play, rather than trying to reach the base.\u201d\n\nWhy the league thinks it needs a new rule rather than simply enforcing an old one is unclear. Perhaps it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to allow umpires to exercise any judgment and, rather, would prefer to make some objective standard for such plays, even if the judging of a runner\u2019s intent is essential. Perhaps they just like the idea of a \u201cChase Utley Rule\u201d and don\u2019t want to use an old one for that.\n\nEither way: the legal takeout slide is an endangered species in Major League Baseball, thanks to Mr. Utley. And may soon be extinct.\n\nFollow @craigcalcaterra", "'Frustrating' Berahino staying at West Brom": "Tony Pulis insists Saido Berahino will not be sold in January despite his public criticism of the striker, who has been labelled 'frustrating' by West Brom captain Darren Fletcher following his latest controversy.\n\nHead coach Pulis said before Monday's 1-0 win over Newcastle at The Hawthorns that Berahino was \"lucky to be on the bench\" for the game, and that the striker \"lets himself down at times\".\n\nHe refused to elaborate any further, but after the England Under-21 international appeared as a second-half substitute, Pulis was quick to play down talk of the player's exit.\n\n\"It is no surprise [that he came on],\" Pulis said following the win. \"Saido at times has got to understand it is about the team and it is about doing things together and being together.\n\n\"He has been told. Everything is alright, he was fine and I have pulled him and told him \u2013 he understands. There were no problems bringing him on.\"\n\nWhen asked if he wanted Berahino to leave in January, Pulis added: \"No, not at all. We are keen to keep the lad here.\n\n\"Obviously he has had a very, very - not even an up and down season because of what happened in the summer [when he tried to force through a move to Tottenham]. The kid will get better and stronger for it.\"\n\nBerahino has scored just three goals this season and has once again been linked with a move to Tottenham, but it is his off-the-pitch conduct that has drawn most of the attention, with Fletcher conceding that the 22-year-old is at times his own worst enemy.\n\nThe former Manchester United midfielder - scorer of the winning goal against Newcastle - told Sky Sports: \"He [Berahino] has had a difficult time. I have spoken to Saido and you know a lot of people have.\n\n\"He's a real good kid; he does some silly things at times that you get really frustrated with.\n\n\"He's a real talented player - that's the biggest frustration how good a player he is and how talented he is and he does things that are a little bit petulant at times, but he's young as well and I think everyone's got to remember that.\n\n\"Maybe it's a little more highlighted with him after this situation [with Tottenham]. It happens at all clubs but everyone does try and speak to him and he's a well-liked member of the squad.\n\n\"We'll see what happens in January but he's always welcome here because we think highly of him and we want him to do well in the game.\"\n\nOn Monday\u2019s result, Fletcher added: \"It is a massive three points. We have had a couple of results that went against us \u2013 two defeats in a row on the back of a really tough run.\n\n\"We hadn't had much luck in the games but I thought our performance was fantastic, especially first half we really took the game to Newcastle with real high energy and I think it was a thoroughly deserved three points.\"", "The Stew's MLB Year in Review: Best fan moments": "For this installment of our MLB Year in Review, we're talking about memorable fan catches, a wild dive for a souvenir, the best first pitch of the year and one fan's unfortunate series of foul-ball gaffes.\n\n[PREVIOUSLY: The best MLB social media moments of 2015]\n\nSo here are the top MLB fan moments of 2015, as picked by The Stew crew:\n\nView photo .

Yes, Hartley\u2019s barehanded snag at Wrigley Field this past June was impressive (though Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Adrian Gonzalez might not agree).\n\nBut you notice what\u2019s in Hartley\u2019s other hand? A baby. Young Isaac Hartley, all of just 7-months old, was just trying to get fed by his father when Keith stretched his hand out from the front row and stole an out away from Gonzalez.\n\nFor a beleaguered fan base that\u2019s still dealing with the repercussions of Steve Bartman\u2019s interference during the 2003 National League Championship Series, you would think the Cub faithful would be extra cautious when it comes to snagging balls in play.\n\nNah. Not Hartley.\n\n''That was outstanding,'' Cubs manager Joe Maddon said after the game. ''You worry about the baby, of course. But he looked like he had it under control.''\n\nEasy for you to say, Joe. Not your baby. I bet Mrs. Maddon wouldn\u2019t share the same sentiments. In the end, Hartley\u2019s bad parenting and selfishness ended up costing the Cubs an out as Jason Hammel was ruled off due to fan interference.

Then there's this Yankees fan, who had three opportunities to snag a ball and came up short each time. The first fail was understandable: a foul ball rose high above his first row seats and he couldn't make the grab with his back turned to the field. The second attempt was slightly more egregious, as he was unable to corral a ground ball that hopped harmlessly into his arms. And the third was easily the most embarrassing, as he fumbled a ball tossed his way by a Yankees ball boy. He ultimately ended up with a ball, picking the one from the ball boy off the ground, but as any experienced baseball fan will tell you, it's not about the ball, it's about making the play.

Well, you could say the fan in question had to be caught and reeled in like a fish.\n\nOn July 10, during the seventh inning of a game between the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants at AT&T Park, a Giants fan threw caution to the wind and jumped into McCovey Cove to retrieve a home run from S.F. second baseman Joe Panik. The ball actually bounced in the seats, down to the concrete below and into the water. The fan didn't hesitate for a second. Nevermind any cell phone, wallet or other valuables he might have been carrying. He had to get the ball. I've got nothing but respect for that kind of dedication.\n\nTo me, being willing to throw yourself into a body of water to get a home run ball trumps any one-handed catch, snagging a ball in a beer cup or diving over rows of seats for a souvenir. Not only was the guy willing to take the plunge, he had to endure the humiliation of being fished out of the cove with a life preserver because there were no boats in the cove at the time. #respect (Kyle Ringo)\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nMike Aviles' daughter throws out first pitch\n\nIs it cheating to call Mike Aviles' daughter a \"fan?\" I don't care. This was one of the best moments of the 2015 season. Aviles' daughter, Adriana, was diagnosed with leukemia in May and wound up throwing out a first pitch in August. Considering all she had been through at that point, and how much the team took care of Aviles during such a tough time, it was hard not to get teary-eyed watching Adriana deliver the pitch to her dad.

In late July, a Los Angeles Angels who brought his own homemade \"Trout Net\" to the stadium did exactly what he was hoping when he built that contraption. Trout hit a grand slam and it landed right in the Trout Net.\n\nThis was a collision of two things I enjoy a lot: Fans putting in creative effort before coming to the park and a fan making an impressive catch on a homer or foul ball.

And to the hero went the spoils, as he received a kiss on the cheek in front of millions of people.

After a skid that's only half that long, the Detroit Pistons somehow sound more fatalistic.\n\nA look at their upcoming schedule might make the Knicks a bit more despondent, though, with Tuesday night's home date with the Pistons serving as perhaps their best chance to keep their rough patch from spiraling out of control.\n\nNew York has been vastly improved from last season's 17-win disaster, but there have been signs of a lengthy backslide in the past five weeks. The Knicks (14-18) are currently on their third four-game skid in that stretch, and they're averaging just 93.0 points in this one after a four-game winning streak in which they never scored less than 107.\n\nThey shot 37.1 percent in Sunday's 100-91 loss at Boston, the second time on their three-game road trip they shot under 40. New York has connected on just 27.9 percent of its 3s in the past six games.\n\n''It's more stress than anything because you're praying (for them) to go in, you're hoping them to go in,'' said Anthony, the offensive outlier at 53.3 percent in his last four. ''It's not confident when you're shooting the ball.''\n\nKristaps Porzingis is shooting 31.8 percent in his last 10, but Anthony isn't going to let the rookie or anyone else feel sorry for themselves.\n\n\"We have a positive attitude, we've just gotta figure out a way to win basketball games,\" Anthony said. \"The attitude is not going anywhere. I won't allow that.\"\n\nIt could be tough to stay that optimistic. The Pistons (17-14) are New York's sixth opponent in a stretch of 11 straight against above .500 teams, and Chicago, Miami, San Antonio and two games with Atlanta await.\n\nDetroit has its own issues to sort out, though. It has followed a 5-1 stretch with losses to Atlanta and Boston, and slow starts have hurt the Pistons. They trailed by 15 at the half against the Hawks, then committed 13 first-half turnovers while digging themselves an eight-point deficit late in the second quarter Saturday against the Celtics.\n\n''Right now, our starters aren't giving us a thing, and our bench is having to try to save us,'' coach Stan Van Gundy told the team's official website. ''We've had awful starts in the last three games, and (Saturday) we had an awful third quarter. They had yesterday off, but they played like they practiced for 6 1/2 hours.''\n\nA lack of ball movement has been a problem. The Pistons, already assisting on a league-low 48.2 percent of their field goals, have seen that drop to 45.2 in their past six games.\n\n\"When the ball doesn't move and there's no crispness and there's no energy, that's what ends up happening,\" Van Gundy said. \"It's just all products of the same thing.\"\n\nBoth Van Gundy and Andre Drummond think Detroit's defense must improve. The Pistons are 10-4 when holding their opponent to 45 percent shooting or worse, but they're allowing 104.3 points per 100 possessions in their last six after that number was at 99.1 through 25 games.\n\n\"I feel like we've lost our identity a little bit,\" Drummond said. \"Now that our shots are falling a little bit more, we've taken a step back defensively and it starts with me.

That is why he decided to focus on the technicals of a stock, especially when it comes to determining if a stock is overbought and ripe for a pullback\u2014or oversold and ready for a bounce.\n\nInvestors can determine if a stock is overbought or oversold by charting the ratio of higher closes, also known as the relative strength index, or RSI. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the direction that a stock is going, and the velocity of the move.\n\nCramer also likes to match the RSI of an individual stock to something else, maybe the relative strength of its sector or a larger index, and then measure the price action historically. He looks for anomalies where strength stands out, because that is a sign that there is a pending move, or a change in momentum.\n\n\"Typically when a stock gets overbought it is ripe for a pullback because overbought stocks, ones with many buyers reaching to take in supply, tend to snap back after they have gotten too far away from their longer term trend line,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nThe inverse can also be true. This means a stock can also fall so fast that investors should expect it to snap back, because it is technically oversold. These patterns are reliable indicators that a change in direction is about to occur, and are terrific action points.\n\nSo if you are debating whether to buy a stock, have done all the research and find that the stock is overbought, Cramer said to wait for the inevitable pullback that almost always happens.\n\nSometimes stocks can even break through all of the ceilings of traditional significant measurement periods, and then stay overbought for weeks at a time. These stocks defy the notion of the inevitable gravitational pull of the old equilibrium line, and can't be contained.\n\n\"When you spot these highly unusual moves you may be able to strap yourself into a real moon shot,\" Cramer said. (Tweet this)\n\nVolume is another key tool that chartists use to find pivots. It is often said that volume can be a lie detector to tell investors if a move is real or not. When there is a small move on light volume, technicians ignore it.\n\nStill, when there is a small move on heavy volume, the chartists are all over it to figure out if it is tradable. They are looking to see if large money managers are starting to accumulate or distribute the stock in an aggressive way.\n\nThe chartists measure something called an accumulation distribution line. This involves charting whether a stock closes higher on greater volume on any given day, versus lower or low volume. Most brokerage firms offer this kind of charting on its website.\n\nRead more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer\n\nCramer: What Apple must do to skyrocket in 2016\n\nCramer: Low oil is pure nirvana for this company\n\nCramer: Biotechs to load up on for 2016\n\nCramer saw this occur with Monsanto (NYSE: MON) in July 2012. He didn't care for the stock of the company at the time. But the accumulation-distribution line showed that while the stock had down days with light volume and up days with heavy volume. That was a sure sign that more money was flowing into the stock, rather than out of it.\n\nIt turns out that Monsanto's stock had started correlating with the price of corn (Chicago Board of Trade: @C.1), which was going higher because of new demand for ethanol engendered by government price supports. Cramer was too concerned about near-term earnings, and worries about a shortfall to recognize what was happening.\n\n\"Powerful moves can, and often do, elude those who are only focused on the underlying companies and not the action of the stocks themselves,\" Cramer said.\n\nQuestions for Cramer?\n\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\n\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

(AP) -- On the brink of elimination from the playoff race, the Indianapolis Colts dug in.\n\nTheir defense made a last-minute stand, third-string quarterback Charlie Whitehurst again came off the bench and the Colts kept alive their faint postseason hopes Sunday, beating the Miami Dolphins 18-12.\n\nMiami had first-and-goal at the 5 with 40 seconds left, but after three consecutive incompletions, rookie backup center Jamil Douglas snapped the ball prematurely, and Ryan Tannehill was sacked by three Colts.\n\nIndy backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck left with an injury for the fourth game in a row, and Whitehurst did just enough in relief, completing two scoring drives.\n\nThe Colts (7-8) would have been out of the playoff race with a loss, and they can still be eliminated in Week 16 if Cincinnati wins at Denver on Monday.\n\n''We did our job today,'' Whitehurst said. ''That's kind of what we can control. We need a little bit of help. Hopefully it goes our way, and we'll have a fun week of practice and have something to play for next week.''\n\nMiami (5-10) was eliminated two weeks ago, and a half-empty stadium reflected the sad state of the franchise. The Dolphins have lost three in a row and are 4-7 under interim coach Dan Campbell, who is likely to be replaced after the season.\n\nThe Dolphins couldn't beat a third-string QB. Indy's Andrew Luck missed his sixth consecutive game with a lacerated kidney and a partially torn abdominal muscle, and Hasselbeck left in the second quarter with a right shoulder injury.\n\nWhitehurst completed a third-down pass on his first play, setting up the Colts' second touchdown for a 15-6 lead. He also directed a 10-play drive early in the fourth quarter for a field goal that made it 18-9.\n\n''I did OK, and I got a lot help,'' Whitehurst said. ''The defense really delivered.''\n\nWhitehurst hurt his hamstring and was limping after being sacked on third down with three minutes left. But he was needed for only one more snap - out of the victory formation on the final play.\n\nHasselbeck said he was ''not super optimistic'' he would be available to play next Sunday against Tennessee.\n\n''We'll do an MRI Monday, but I think it's just an AC sprain, which is great news,'' Hasselbeck said. ''I had this injury to my left arm a long, long time ago, so I kind of know it's not that serious. It's just a matter of how quick.''\n\nThe afternoon was rough on quarterbacks for both teams. Tannehill was sacked six times, hurt his left leg late in the game and walked with a limp in the locker room.\n\n''It's not easy to win when quarterbacks get hit,'' he said. ''That's something we have to fix.''\n\nThe Colts' season-high sack total included rookie T.Y. McGill's first career sack for a safety and the game's first points. Robert Mathis was credited with the final, game-clinching sack thanks to the botched snap by Douglas, who was filling in for injured Pro Bowl center Mike Pouncey.\n\n''My fault,'' an emotional Douglas said. ''I should have been locked in on that play. Bad play by me.''\n\n''He feels like it's on his shoulders, but it's not,'' Campbell said. ''There are enough mistakes to go around, offensively and defensively. It's never one man's fault.''\n\nThe defense allowed Frank Gore to rush for 85 yards and score the Colts' touchdowns on runs of 37 and 11 yards. The South Florida native was playing in Miami for the first time.\n\nTannehill threw for 329 yards, but was intercepted in the end zone by Vontae Davis to end a Dolphins threat. A questionable offensive pass interference penalty on the Dolphins' Jarvis Landry negated a Tannehill touchdown pass to Jordan Cameron, and they settled for a field goal.\n\nLandry became the first Miami player to have 100 catches in a season. He had seven receptions for 111 yards, including a sensational one-handed catch as he tumbled to the turf for a 26-yard gain.\n\nNotes: Dolphins LB Jelani Jenkins aggravated an ankle injury and left the game in the third quarter. ... Colts guard Hugh Thornton left the game in the first half with an ankle injury. ... The Colts' Adam Vinatieri joined Morten Andersen and Gary Anderson as the only players in league history with 500 field goals. However, Vinatieri missed an extra point for the third time this season.\n\n---\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL\n\n---\n\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine", "MLB to offer single-team MLB.tv packages in 2016": "Single-team MLB.tv subscriptions will be available in 2016. (MLB.tv screen grab)\n\nFor diehard baseball fans, MLB.tv is a must-have service. For the very reasonable price of $129.99, you can watch every out-of-market game for the season. Baseball nerds like me more than get their money's worth.\n\nBut, for casual fans, dropping $130 for the full service might not be so appealing. Rather than watch multiple games each night, some folks just want to watch a few innings of their favorite team a couple days a week. Paying for the full package in those instances is not ideal.\n\nThankfully, MLB will introduce single-team packages next season, allowing fans to subscribe to their favorite teams rather than the entire league. The all-or-nothing aspect of MLB.tv will be eliminated.\n\nThe news comes not from MLB itself, but from a lawsuit filing passed along by Nathaniel Grow of FanGraphs. The lawsuit, Garber vs. Office of the Commissioner of Baseball, is challenging various league broadcasting practices under federal antitrust law. Buried in the filing is this tidbit:\n\n\"... beginning next season MLB will make single-team, out-of-market streams available for purchase (alongside the out-of-market package) on MLB.TV.\"\n\nSo yes, the single-team package does still only cover out-of-market games. MLB has reached an agreement allowing in-market streaming of clubs broadcast on Fox affiliates starting next year -- that covers 15 of the 30 clubs -- but that is a separate service. You have to be a cable subscriber to have access to that.\n\nThe single-team MLB.tv package is its own plan. A Pirates fan in California could subscribe and follow their favorite team without getting stuck paying for all the broadcasts they never watch, for example. That's a pretty great service for fans who only want a piece of the pie and not the whole thing.\n\nMLB has yet to officially announce the single-team plans and there's no word on the cost just yet.

If the Broncos (11-4) win at home against San Diego (4-11) next Sunday, they'll get the bye.\n\nInstead of having a week off to let Andy Dalton's broken thumb heal, the AFC North champions would host a playoff game and then have to win two more on the road in order to reach the Super Bowl - a much tougher road.\n\nThis one really stings.\n\n''Obviously, we knew what we had in front of us, the opportunity to get the bye,'' defensive end Carlos Dunlap said.\n\nSeveral Bengals starters are injured and were hoping for a week of rest. Receiver A.J. Green is playing with a sore back. Tight end Tyler Eifert missed the past two games with a concussion. Safety George Iloka missed the past two games with an injured groin. Cornerback Adam ''Pacman'' Jones is playing with an injured right foot.\n\nView gallery Cincinnati Bengals quarterback AJ McCarron (5) is tackled by Denver Broncos defensive end Derek Wolf \u2026\n\nPlus, a bye would have given Dalton another week for the broken bone in his right thumb to heal. It's been two weeks since the injury. The Bengals are hoping to get him back for the playoffs, but the likely first-round game complicates it.\n\n''It's tough,'' Green said. ''We have a lot of guys banged up, so we could have really used that bye. All we have to do is go out there and take care of next weekend, and hope for the best.''\n\nThe Bengals host Baltimore (5-10) on Sunday. They can still get a first-round bye if they beat the Ravens and the Broncos lose, or if they lose and the Broncos lose and the Chiefs win.\n\nThe way that they lost in Denver was as disappointing as anything. AJ McCarron made his second NFL start and was impressive in the first half. He led the Bengals on two long touchdown drives to open the game against the league's top-ranked defense, and got them in position for a field goal that Mike Nugent missed.\n\nMcCarron's performance in the opening half was enough to reassure Cincinnati that it can still win in the playoffs if Dalton's unavailable. McCarron was 12 of 17 for 119 yards with a touchdown and no sacks or interceptions as Cincinnati led 14-3.\n\nView gallery Denver Broncos outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware, right, lies on his fumble recovery for the win afte \u2026\n\n''He played great,'' Green said. ''He did everything right.''\n\nThe Broncos played more zone coverage and blitzed more in the second half, when McCarron was 10 of 18 for 81 yards with a pair of sacks. He fumbled a shotgun snap in overtime, sealing it.\n\n''We put ourselves in a position to win the ballgame and I failed the team,'' McCarron said. ''That is what it comes down to.''\n\nMcCarron hurt his left wrist while trying to recover the fumble and was scheduled for tests on Tuesday. It's his non-throwing hand, so he's expected to start against the Ravens. The backup is Keith Wenning, who was a fifth-round pick of the Ravens in 2014 and spent the season on their practice squad. He was promoted from the Bengals' practice squad after Dalton got hurt.\n\nThe Bengals are left in a position of needing a lot of help to get a bye and improve their chances of ending the sixth-longest streak of playoff futility in NFL history. They haven't won a playoff game since the 1990 season.\n\n''It just leaves all the 'what ifs' out there,'' safety Reggie Nelson said. ''I mean, back to square one.''\n\nNotes: The Bengals signed QB Mike Kafka to their practice squad on Tuesday. He was Philadelphia's fourth-round pick in 2010 and appeared in four games in 2011, going 11 of 16 for 107 yards with two interceptions. He was with Minnesota and Tennessee earlier this season. ... The Bengals finished 6-2 on the road, matching their best mark for a season. They've done it four times in their 48 years. ... Cincinnati fell to 3-17 in Monday night games on the road. They've dropped their past six since winning in Cleveland in 1990.\n\n---\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL", "Karl-Anthony Towns defends play while holding Andrew Wiggins' shoe": "The NBA recently witnessed a controversial act of shoe-throwing when Denver Nuggets wing Will Barton discarded the lost sneaker of Houston Rockets counterpart Trevor Ariza in an attempt to get a leg up on the competition. Barton received a technical foul, but his resourcefulness will live on forever.\n\n[Follow Dunks Don't Lie on Tumblr: The best slams from all of basketball]\n\nHowever, Minnesota Timberwolves center and Rookie of the Year favorite Karl-Anthony Towns showed that shoe-related ingenuity does not have to involve negation. Roughly two minutes into Monday's road game against the San Antonio Spurs, Towns's teammate Andrew Wiggins lost his shoe on an awkward step towards the perimeter. Towns picked up the sneaker but thoughtfully did not toss his friend's possession like a piece of garbage. Instead, he held on for the rest of the Wolves' defensive stand:\n\nIt's important to note that Towns did his job during this possession \u2014 he tracked Tony Parker through the lane and stepped out to the perimeter for a light trap before Parker passed to LaMarcus Aldridge for a shot blocked by Tayshuan Prince. It's even possible to argue that the sneaker aided him in this task, because it added a few inches to Towns's already impressive wingspan. It's not so easy to pass around a much bigger player who happens to be wielding a large shoe.\n\nTowns finished with a solid 10 points and 12 rebounds in 30 minutes. This dunk wasn't half-bad, either:\n\nBut he and the Wolves could have used that shoe on more possessions as Spurs center Boban Marjanovic scored 17 points while making all seven of his field goals.

(Frank Gunn//The Canadian Press via AP)\n\n1. David Price, SP: SIGNED Last time a pitcher of David Price\u2019s ilk hit free agency, he was guaranteed $210 million. That was Max Scherzer last season, and by almost every measure Price has been a better pitcher. He\u2019s one of seven with a sub-3.00 ERA since 2010. He has thrown the fourth-most innings in that span. He\u2019s among the top 25 in strikeouts, walks and homers per nine. Price, 30, is as complete as it comes, left-handed and still powerful, with the sort of devastating changeup that ages well and the pitching know-how that should make a seven-year deal tolerable, if not palatable. That\u2019s the going rate for elite these days, and Boston jumped headlong into the silly season and paid Price $217 million.\n\n2. Zack Greinke, SP: SIGNED Here\u2019s how to play free agency perfectly. Sign a deal for $147 million. Front-load $76 million into the first three years. Put up one of the most spectacular seasons ever, in which your ERA, compared to the rest of the league, is the 14th best in history. Use an opt-out clause savvily negotiated by your agent to hit free agency immediately after that historic season. And fall into a marketplace frothing to pay elite pitchers, particularly ones whose skill sets make another six- or even a seven-year deal a reality at age 32. This is Zack Greinke\u2019s world - a world that will take him to Arizona in a surprise six-year deal.\n\n3. Chris Davis, 1B/OF: The entirety of Davis\u2019 free agency comes down to one question: Which team will ignore 2014? Forget the Adderall suspension. Davis hit .196 and had a below-league-average OPS. In the two seasons sandwiched around it, he led the American League in home runs, hitting a combined 100. And that\u2019s why despite the 200 strikeouts a year, the OK-but-not-great glove, the frightening prospect of him tumbling downhill as his 30th birthday beckons, Davis will get capital-P paid. Power is baseball\u2019s opiate of the masses.\n\n4. Jason Heyward, OF: SIGNED Let\u2019s be honest: The best thing Heyward has going for him is his age. He is a free agent at 26 years old, and 26-year-old free agents come around as often as Halley\u2019s Comet. Getting four years of a player in his 20s is a coup when the biggest concern involves free agents ripening. That said, other factors exist for Heyward. He\u2019s a mountain of a man at 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, and generally that size \u2013 even the in-shape sorts like Heyward \u2013 don\u2019t age well. His most elite skill is his glove, and corner-outfield spots are, what, the sixth most-important on the field? Heyward\u2019s second half was exciting \u2013 he hit .318/.397/.469 with 32 walks against 33 strikeouts \u2013 but even then came only four home runs in 274 plate appearances. The power exists. We\u2019ve seen it. But maybe, at this point, that\u2019s just who Heyward is: A younger Alex Gordon \u2013 great, yes, but not $200 million great.\n\n5. Justin Upton, OF: At the end of every season, Upton finds himself in about the same place. His OBP somewhere near .350. His slugging percentage in the vicinity of .450. Between 25 and 30 home runs. About 20 stolen bases. For someone so consistent year-over-year, he is maddeningly inconsistent during the season, looking like one of the game\u2019s best hitters one month (May 2015: .343/.418/.546) and then spending the next two months as one of the worst (June and July 2015: .182/.277/.309). With Upton, you are buying a designed-on-the-fly roller coaster with a fixed endpoint. It will be the most frustrating .800-or-so OPS season imaginable, and yet it\u2019ll be there, and enough comfort in that exists for someone to give the 28-year-old well over $100 million.\n\n6. Alex Gordon, OF: Back before four Gold Gloves adorned his trophy case, Gordon was a near-bust third baseman shifting to the outfield. It didn\u2019t prevent him from uttering words that at the time looked fanciful at best, goofy at worst: \u201cI\u2019m going to dominate next season.\u201d And out he came in 2011 and did just that, not looking back since. Gordon\u2019s glove in left field is peerless. His work ethic is close behind. Wherever he ends up, he\u2019ll be the most diesel guy in the room, and while a six-pack doesn\u2019t guarantee the success of a long-term deal, he\u2019s 31 going on 21. Gordon gets on base, hits for gap power and runs the bases well and intelligently. Whoever wants Heyward but not at that price can get Gordon and gamble the age gap is just a number.\n\n7. Johnny Cueto, SP: SIGNED He\u2019s not this high because he retired 19 straight Astros in the division series or turned the Mets into mush with a two-hit complete game in the World Series. Over the last five years, Cueto has a 2.71 ERA that has belied his peripherals because balls in play simply don\u2019t fall for hits against him. And for those who believe batting average on balls in play is pure luck, Cueto would argue that inducing bad contact is a skill, one at which he\u2019s particularly adept. His free agency might be the most fascinating in the game because the range of what he could conceivably get. If his elbow checks out \u2013 it had a couple dodgy moments in 2015 \u2013 the answer will skew far higher.\n\nView gallery . The Yoenis Cespedes emoji has a .220 OBP. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson) 8. Yoenis Cespedes, OF: Certainly Cespedes\u2019 excellence after his trade to the Mets isn\u2019t to be denied, but let\u2019s be real about what he is: Someone who, since his rookie season, has gotten on base 31 percent of the time. In the depressed run-scoring environment, Cespedes\u2019 power plays, but to give $150 million to a .319 OBP guy at 30 years old is asking for a disaster. He\u2019s not a center fielder, unless you like Cristiano Ronaldo roaming there, and better corner-outfielder options exist. At his best, he is thrilling. Paying someone for his best is the most dangerous thing a baseball team can do.\n\n9. Ben Zobrist, UT: SIGNED One of the team-friendliest contracts of this generation finally comes off the books, and Zobrist, at 34, wants to get paid. He deserves it. His versatility remains his hallmark, and between that and his glove and his OBP and his gap power and his baserunning, it is safe to say this: Ben Zobrist is good at everything. Greatness, of course, or the potential for, is what gets free agents paid, and the market for Zobrist, ripe though it may be, will come down to whether any team goes a fourth year, and Chicago did just that by signing him to a $56 million contract.\n\n10. Matt Wieters, C:SIGNED Never did Wieters develop into the deity once predicted \u2013 his teammates at Georgia Tech called him \u201cGod\u201d \u2013 but he is still this: 29 years old, with power, tremendous game-calling acumen and an arm coming off Tommy John surgery that looked better as the year went on. He's going to pull an Adrian Beltre by opting for a one-year, make-good contract, playing the season out at Baltimore's $15.8 million qualifying offer and putting himself in a better position to fetch the nine-figure deal that probably isn\u2019t there right now. Three-quarters of it probably is out there somewhere, though, and the allure should be strong enough to find Wieters elsewhere in 2016 and beyond.\n\n11. Jordan Zimmermann, SP: SIGNED Never before has a pitcher with a Tommy John scar adorning his elbow signed a $100 million deal. Zimmermann didn\u2019t exactly stump for his cause with a 3.66 ERA fueled by a home-run spike. Still, he has been the paragon of consistency in the five years since his surgery, a 200-inning workhorse capable of command-based dominance. And some team will ignore that the lifespan on new elbow ligaments averages out somewhere around seven years and give Zimmermann a big-money deal hoping he\u2019s atypical. That team was Detroit, who gave Zimmermann a $110 million deal.\n\n12. Ian Desmond, SS: It\u2019s nice to be a shortstop. Desmond was a mess in 2015, hitting .211/.255/.334 in the first half and .195/.261/.320 on the road. His second-half and home splits counterbalanced those numbers enough to make his season at least tolerable, good enough that a team will give him $75 million because of his positional value. While nobody is weeping for the 30-year-old Desmond\u2019s misfortune of making millions, a good season might\u2019ve earned him twice that.\n\n13. Mike Leake, SP: SIGNED Getting around 200 innings of slightly above-average baseball is a massive asset, the sort that gets guys like Leake five-year deals. He\u2019ll play all of 2016 at 28 years old, which puts him above others on this list, as does a 50-plus percent groundball rate that makes up for his low strikeouts. Leake\u2019s five-pitch mix is the sort that forced him to get crafty at a young age, and he\u2019ll take that skill into his 30s when he calls upon it even more in St. Louis.\n\n14. Dexter Fowler, CF: Here\u2019s the list of center fielders the last five years with OBPs above .365: Mike Trout, Andrew McCutchen, Dexter Fowler. That\u2019s it. And at least one team will buy into the idea that Fowler can stay in center long-term \u2013 a dubious proposition \u2013 which is all he needs to get a deal that doesn\u2019t quite reach nine figures but shouldn\u2019t be far behind.\n\n15. Wei-Yin Chen, SP: Quick: Who has started more games in the AL East the last four years than anyone? Yup. And the 30-year-old\u2019s 3.72 ERA, for pitching as much as he does in the division and its ballparks, is even more impressive. Chen is a left-hander whose fastball sits at 92 and tops 95, and if he can cut back on the home runs, he\u2019ll be worth more than the $15 million-plus a year he should command.\n\n16. John Lackey, SP: SIGNED Getting Lackey for $507,500 last season was a classic Cardinals coup. He is going to cost a lot more this year. No team in their right mind will give a 37-year-old with a Tommy John surgery on his ledger more than three years. The proper number is two years, and if Lackey asks $20 million a year for each, it\u2019s not far-fetched. He didn't get that, however, settling for $16 million a year from the Chicago Cubs.\n\n17. Howie Kendrick, 2B: The epitome of he is what he is: A slightly above-average hitter who plays a desirable position well enough to stay there. He\u2019ll bat .290, get on base 33 percent of the time and slug about .420. And even at 32 years old, that\u2019s worth a lot in free agency.\n\nView gallery . Opposing batters feasted on Jeff Samardzija in 2015. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) 18. Jeff Samardzija, SP: SIGNED There is no sugarcoating the fact that Samardzija\u2019s 2015 season was a pile of fetid garbage. And yet like the previous two seasons, he exceeded 210 innings \u2013 something only Scherzer and R.A. Dickey did \u2013 and that alone warrants a big payday. The fact that Samardzija\u2019s previous season was as good as it was should help matters. He may not be the hundred-something-million-dollar guy he looked like after 2014, but he did get $90 million from the San Francisco Giants.\n\n19. Denard Span, CF: His health will dictate where he goes and how much a team gives him. Because, when right, Span can be a force at the top of the lineup and solid enough in center to add value. Hip surgery is finicky, though, and locking in Span long-term comes with perils. The fact that the Nationals didn\u2019t extend him a qualifying offer \u2013 usually a good thing for a player \u2013 says they have their questions, too.\n\n20. Scott Kazmir, SP: Though the midseason trade to Houston did Kazmir no favors, he\u2019ll start next season at just 32, meaning a four-year deal is well within the realm of possibilities.\n\n21. Kenta Maeda, SP: Consistently the best pitcher in Japan since Yu Darvish and Masahiro Tanaka left, Maeda is unlike his two predecessors in stuff. He is more precision than power. The bigger question than whether Maeda is more a No. 2, No. 4 or somewhere in between is whether his team, the Hiroshima Carp, will post him this season. If they do, major league teams will gladly pay the $20 million posting fee and plenty more on top of that.\n\n22. Brett Anderson, SP: SIGNED Last year was Anderson's first healthy season since 2009. But damn if a 66.3 percent groundball rate from a 27-year-old left-hander isn\u2019t worth a substantial risk, because if Anderson turns into even a reliable 180-inning guy, they\u2019re a tremendous 180 innings. Teams won't be able to make that risk until next offseason as Anderson accepted a qualifying offer from the Dodgers.\n\n23. Daniel Murphy, 2B: SIGNED The quandary with Murphy is whether a team is willing to eat his shortcomings at second base to reap the benefits of his bat there, and Washington is willing to take that risk.\n\n24. Byung-ho Park, 1B/DH: SIGNED One scout\u2019s take on the giant 29-year-old Korean with second-to-none bat-flip skills: \u201cA poor man\u2019s Jose Abreu.\u201d That will play, and the $12.85 million posting fee proffered by the Minnesota Twins \u2013 with multiple bids in the $11 million range \u2013 before his contract shows teams are betting on it as well.\n\n25. Colby Rasmus, CF: SIGNED Let him play shirtless and you just may have the second coming of Ruth. Clothed, he would have been in line for a three-year deal after a .475-slugging season, but Rasmus made history by becoming the first player to accept a $15.8 million qualifying offer and will remain in Houston.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\n26. Hisashi Iwakuma, SP: SIGNED Another qualifying-offer candidate, Iwakuma\u2019s stuff was off early in the season before a push toward the end left him looking similar to seasons past. If he wants three years and $45 million, he should be able to get it, and he did from the Mariners after the Dodgers backed out.\n\n27. Darren O\u2019Day, RP: SIGNED The best reliever on the market is a sidewinding right-hander whose fastball lives around 86 mph \u2013 88 on a good day. Forget those numbers and focus on this one: 1.92. That\u2019s O\u2019Day\u2019s ERA over the last four years, in which he has struck out more than a batter an inning with fewer than one baserunner per. Setup man, closer, whatever. In the end, O'Day decided to stay with the O's.\n\n28. Ian Kennedy, SP: While his stuff ticked back up last year, giving up a draft pick for a pitcher coming off three straight seasons in San Diego with adjusted ERAs below league average is a difficult prospect. Still, he\u2019ll be just 31, and his strikeout rate is among the best in the Class of 2015.\n\n29. Dae-ho Lee, 1B/DH: A giant human being \u2013 like, 6-foot-4, 300-pounds \"giant\" \u2013 whose power is without question. He hit 31 home runs in Japan this season, his fourth year there after a decade as a Korean fixture. Teams will get past the body and the age (33) and delight in his no-posting-system free agency enough to get him multiple years.\n\n30. Asdrubal Cabrera, SS: SIGNED Positional scarcity is a real thing. And a 30-year-old shortstop like Cabrera who hits something like .250/.310/.400 is worth multiple years at $10 million-plus per.\n\n31. Yovani Gallardo, SP: Someone is going to fall in love with the ERA, and that\u2019s all well and good. Here are the more important numbers: 9.0, 7.2, 6.8, 5.9. Those are his strikeout rates the past four years, and they portend a troublesome future for the 29-year-old Gallardo.\n\n32. Yaisel Sierra, SP: Scouts who have seen the right-hander rave about his stuff, though he started just a quarter of the games he threw in Cuba. Because he\u2019s 24, Sierra won\u2019t count against teams\u2019 international signing bonus pools, which means the money on him could get big.\n\n33. Gerardo Parra, OF: Before his trade to Baltimore, Parra had been one of the best outfielders in the NL, a three-position defensive stalwart with surprising pop in his bat. With the Orioles, he was this. He\u2019ll get paid for the former, though not quite as much as he would\u2019ve.\n\n34. Ryan Madson, RP: SIGNED One of the great stories of 2015, Madson more than made up for his $850,000 salary last season by cashing in with a $22 million deal from Oakland.\n\n35. J.A. Happ, SP: SIGNED Happ went through Ray Searage and Jim Benedict\u2019s Magic Pitching Revitalization Machine and came out a hot commodity. Sneaky old \u2013 he\u2019s 33 \u2013 Happ got three years from Toronto after throwing 63 1/3 innings of 1.85 ERA ball with peripherals to match down the stretch for the Pirates.\n\n36. Joakim Soria, RP: SIGNED Often track record matters more than the previous season for relievers because of such variation in year-to-year performance, and Soria\u2019s history \u2013 even with two Tommy John surgeries on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2013 should be enough for the biggest deal of his career. Soria is returning to Kansas City on a three-year, $25 million deal.\n\n37. Marco Estrada, SP: SIGNED How much will teams pay for a guy with the single lowest BABIP among starters last season (.216) by a 13-point margin? If \u201ctoo much\u201d is not a good answer, \u201ca lot\u201d unsatisfactorily suffices. Regression is imminent, but it didn't prevent Toronto from signing Estrada to a two-year, $26 million deal.\n\n38. John Jaso, DH/OF: SIGNED Even if he\u2019s not a catcher anymore because of concussion issues, Jaso can hit. He kills right-handers in particular, and his high on-base and low-strikeout skills should play well in Pittsburgh.\n\n39. Austin Jackson, CF: Negligible bat. OK glove. His saving graces are his position and his age at the beginning of the season, 29, which gives him time to rekindle his past success. A one-year, value-building deal may be best.\n\n40. David Freese, 3B: League-average isn\u2019t a slur, and it\u2019s about what Freese is. At 32, he\u2019s no longer a spring chicken, and he never burgeoned into the star that his 2011 postseason turn foretold. You could do better. You could do worse. And that\u2019s worth about $10 million a year in this market.\n\n41. Marlon Byrd, OF: : As unsightly as his near-.300 OBP may be, Byrd hits for power and plenty of it, even at 38. The strong corner-outfield market may limit him to one year.\n\n42. Seung-hwan Oh, RP: The Mariano Rivera of Korea conquered Japan the last two seasons and now has his sights set on MLB. Could be a sly signing for a team in need of bullpen help.\n\n43. Justin Morneau, 1B: The return of his concussion problems was an awful turn for the former MVP who had won a batting title the year before. He\u2019ll never be the monster he was during his prime in Minnesota, but if his head cooperates, he can still hit.\n\nView gallery . Remember when Tim Lincecum was great? (AP Photo/George Nikitin) 44. Tim Lincecum, SP: The degenerative hip injury that prompted season-ending surgery this year is alarming enough to limit Lincecum\u2019s market to one-year deals. He could wind up a bargain, especially if it turns out the hip was impinging his stuff.\n\n45. Doug Fister, SP: Started 2015 thinking a good season could mean a $100 million deal. Ended it in the Nationals\u2019 bullpen. Nobody could use a value-building one-year deal more than Fister.\n\n46. Chris Young, SP: SIGNED Criminally underpaid the last two seasons, the 36-year-old Young cashed in with a $12 million deal over two seasons in Kansas City.\n\n47. Chris Young, OF: SIGNED At 32, he is younger. But is he Chriser? This CY destroys left-handed pitching and can play all three outfield positions. He\u2019s not the linchpin evaluators once thought he\u2019d be. The Red Sox see value in Young, signing him to a two-year, $13 million contract.\n\n48. Tony Sipp, RP: SIGNED Back-to-back strong seasons with the Astros put him in prime position to grab one of those three-year deals gifted to left-handed relievers every season.\n\n49. Franklin Gutierrez, OF: SIGNED His return from debilitating cases of irritable bowel syndrome and spinal inflammation made for one of the best stories of the season, and after slugging .620, the Mariners decided to bring Gutierrez back on a one-year deal.\n\n50. Rich Hill, SP/RP: SIGNED What is four good starts worth? In the eyes of the Athletics, it's worth a one-year, $6 million deal. Less than a month after Boston brought Hill on from the Atlantic League, the 35-year-old left-hander was in their rotation and dominating. In 29 innings, he struck out 36 and walked five and put up a 1.55 ERA.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\n51. Nori Aoki, OF: SIGNED Gets on base, doesn\u2019t strike out, swipes some bags and plays, uh, interesting defense. Tough to give him an everyday job because the power just isn\u2019t there, but he can try play himself into one with the Mariners.\n\n52. Domonic Brown, OF: At 25, he hit .273/.320/.535 with 23 home runs in the first half. At 28, he\u2019s a free agent. The ultimate change-of-scenery candidate looking for a make-good deal.\n\n53. Antonio Bastardo, RP: The definition of effectively wild. Walks more than four per nine, manages to get away with it as one of the game\u2019s most consistent lefty relievers.\n\n54. Mark Buehrle, SP: The bastion of consistency may well retire after his 16th season. If not, he\u2019ll be in plenty demand, even at 36.\n\n55. Will Venable, OF: After escaping the horror house that is Petco Park, Venable didn\u2019t do much in limited playing time with Texas. He may have to win a starting job wherever he does end up.\n\n56. Bartolo Colon, SP: SIGNED M, 42, pleasantly plump. Good for 200 innings. Will accept salary in GrubHub credit.\n\n57. Alexei Ramirez, SS: A miserable offensive season sent him careening down the list. At 34, there isn\u2019t much time to turn it around, either.\n\n58. Colby Lewis, SP: SIGNED At that point on the list where guys who log 200 innings appear out of their sheer ability to log 200 innings. Lewis is staying put with the Rangers.\n\n59. Mike Pelfrey, SP: SIGNED Hell, even 165-inning guys are getting some love.\n\n60. Trevor Cahill, RP: SIGNED After years of somnambulance in varying rotations, Cahill\u2019s arm woke up with a trip to the bullpen, and scouts extolled the quality of his stuff with the Cubs. Cahill will return to Chicago on a one-year deal in hopes of a bigger payday in 2016.\n\n61. Rajai Davis, OF: SIGNED Career-best 11 triples led to career-best .440 slugging percentage. He\u2019s the perfect fourth outfielder, well capable of patrolling center field and ready to jump into the top of the order when called upon with his new club in Cleveland.\n\nView gallery . What if Chase Utley signed with the Mets? (AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) 62. Chase Utley, 2B: SIGNED A precipitous downturn last season for a player who was so good for so long he\u2019ll get a shot to redeem himself with the Dodgers next season.\n\n63. Mike Napoli, 1B: SIGNED If the Indians use him the right way \u2013 against left-handed pitchers, as the Rangers did \u2013 and he\u2019s a perfectly useful piece.\n\n64. Tyler Clippard, RP: He has carved himself a place among baseball\u2019s relief elite, though Clippard\u2019s peripherals do not portend well, and his 21.2 percent groundball rate is straight unsightly. His deception remains his best trait, one that\u2019s not likely to abandon him even as velocity does.\n\n65. David Murphy, OF: Classic platoon guy who thrives in the hands of a manager capable of understanding how to deploy a left-handed bat.\n\n66. Mark Lowe, RP: SIGNED Ten-year veteran\u2019s breakout season came at the right time. Heading into free agency with a 1.96 ERA should get him a two-year deal at well more than double, maybe even triple, his highest previous salary of $1.7 million.\n\n67. Jerry Blevins, RP: SIGNED Coming off the single greatest perfect season ever. Seriously: No one in history before Blevins finished a year with at least five innings and without allowing a baserunner. Granted, Blevins spent almost the entirety of it injured. His perfect season earned Blevins a one-year, $4 million contract with the Mets.\n\n68. Joe Blanton, RP: First with Kansas City, then Pittsburgh, Blanton made a seamless transition to the bullpen. He struck out more than a batter an inning. His velocity ticked up. A career reborn.\n\n69. Steve Pearce, 1B/OF: Brutal average on balls in play (.232) led to a down year after 2014 breakout. Potentially cheap right-handed power should entice plenty of teams.\n\n70. Mat Latos, SP: Perfect for Boston, not only as a comeback candidate but to reunite with the T he has been missing all these years.\n\n71. Dioner Navarro, C: SIGNED Well capable of catching effectively full-time, Navarro was pushed out of his job last year by Russell Martin. Found a 120-game-a-year gig with the Chicago White Sox.\n\n72. Alfredo Simon, SP: Thrown more than 383 innings the last two years. More than Chris Sale, Lance Lynn, Chen, Gallardo, Lewis, Kazmir and Kennedy, among others.\n\n73. Chris Iannetta, C: SIGNED Vastly improved pitch-framing skills last season, still knows how to draw a walk. Could be a cost-effective upgrade at a difficult position to fill.\n\n74. Ryan Raburn, OF: OPS\u2019d over 1.000 last year against lefties. With the right manager and the right platoon, a very savvy buy.\n\n75. Juan Uribe, 3B: Still can hit, still can acquit himself on the hot corner, still is awesome.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\n76. Alejandro De Aza, OF: SIGNED Hit .262/.333/.422 while spending parts of last season with three teams. He's expected to platoon in center field with the New York Mets after signing a one-year, $5.75 million deal.\n\n77. Shawn Kelley, RP: SIGNED Valhalla for a relief pitcher is Petco Park. And Kelley\u2019s 2.45 ERA with 11 strikeouts per nine left a very good impression for teams seeking right-handed relief.\n\n78. Jarrod Saltalamacchia, C: SIGNED Hit .251/.332/.474 after joining Arizona midseason. And, even better, he gets to double up on his salary this year. Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria, who loves paying people to not work for him, still owes Saltalamacchia $8 million for this season, which might explain why he signed for the league minimum with Detroit.\n\n79. Mark Reynolds, 1B/3B: SIGNED Landed with his seventh team in seven years this offseason by signing with Colorado. At 32, plenty of time to reach Octavio Dotel\u2019s record of 13.\n\n80. Alex Rios, OF: For someone 6-foot-5 and 210 pounds, Rios plays like a slap hitter. In 932 plate appearances the last two years, he has eight home runs. Cespedes hit that many over 10 days this fall.\n\n81. Brayan Pena, C: SIGNED Switch-hitting catcher with excellent contact skills and an even better clubhouse presence? He\u2019ll be in high demand with good reason.\n\n82. Travis Snider, OF: Nothing more than a bet that it\u2019ll finally click, though this is going to be Snider\u2019s ninth season in the major leagues, so it\u2019s probably a bad bet, too.\n\n83. Geovany Soto, C: SIGNED Three teams and seven years ago, he was NL Rookie of the Year. Now, he is 83rd in the Ultimate Free-Agent Tracker. Take that, Rookie of the Year.\n\n84. Ross Ohlendorf, RP: Perpetual low-90s scraper showed up this season throwing 98 for the Rangers. Finally, we can stop calling him the smartest baseball player in the world and instead go with smartest baseball player in the world who gained 6 mph on his fastball.\n\n85. Jason Motte, RP: SIGNED Still not back to his pre-Tommy John form, though his command did sharpen last year, and his stuff could well join it more than two years removed from the surgery.\n\n86. Matt Thornton, RP: When Matt Williams wasn\u2019t getting him warmed up without using him, Thornton proved a plenty effective left-hander with the ability to pitch at least a couple outs an outing, even as he closes in on 40.\n\n87. Kelly Johnson, UT: Plays just about everywhere. Bats left-handed. Plenty to like in a utility guy.\n\n88. Matt Albers, RP: Peripherals didn\u2019t exactly match the ERA (1.21 in 37 1/3 innings), but when he\u2019s healthy, he gets outs, and his health wasn\u2019t a question in the second half.\n\nView gallery . Fernando Rodney knows how to celebrate. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) 89. Fernando Rodney, RP: One season removed from leading the AL in saves, Rodney imploded with Seattle. His mojo returned with the Cubs, where he slung a few arrows and established himself worthy of a one-year deal.\n\n90. Chad Qualls, RP:SIGNED He\u2019s a baseball Honda. Never great. Never flashy. Reliable as can be, though, and his 60 percent groundball rate and 5-to-1 strikeout ratio are solid indicators that he can be expected to improve upon his 4.38 ERA.\n\n91. Oliver Perez, RP: SIGNED He was pretty dreadful with the Astros, but the number of left-handers with more than 11 strikeouts per nine over each of the past three seasons consists of two names: Aroldis Chapman and Perez. Get used to him being around. He\u2019ll pitch until he\u2019s 50 if he wants.\n\n92. Franklin Morales, RP: Just don\u2019t pitch him in the playoffs.\n\n93. Jimmy Rollins, SS: It is sad when a former MVP shows up this low. Father Time, still the undisputed champion of the world.\n\n94. Brandon Beachy, SP: The optimist: If he can stay healthy, the stuff is there for a mid-rotation starter. The pessimist: He can\u2019t stay healthy. The realist: A smart team will take a gamble.\n\n95. A.J. Pierzynski, C: SIGNED Mr. Congeniality ready for his 19th season in the big leagues, coming off one of his best: hit .300, slugged .430, barely struck out. Still a defensive black hole, the Braves ignored the blemishes and signed him to a one-year deal.\n\n96. Ryan Webb, RP: Almost 60 percent groundballs with a turbosinker, slider and changeup is the recipe for a good relief pitcher.\n\n97. Alexi Ogando, RP: SIGNED Perfect reclamation project for a place like Pittsburgh, which takes traditionally difficult pitchers, isolates their issues and reshapes them. Ogando\u2019s raw arm is some kind of special.\n\n98. Kyle Lohse, SP: Put him in a big park, mitigate the home run proneness, let him eat innings and it\u2019s a potential bargain.\n\n99. Carlos Villanueva, RP: Doubled his slider usage to 37.2 percent and turned in the best season of his career. The rare reliever bred to go multiple innings, and for that reason alone his market should be robust.\n\n100. Cliff Lee, SP: A healthy Lee is in the top 20. This position reflects the uncertainty of his left arm and how his entire career depends on it healing. For a couple million, he\u2019d surely be worth the risk, especially for a team that needs to take risks or one in which a couple million is couch-cushion money.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\n101. Grady Sizemore, OF: The fact that he\u2019s almost in the top 100, period, is a victory. The Rays rationed out playing time properly, kept him healthy and watched him turn in his best season since 2009, when he was a superstar-in-the-making.\n\n102. Tommy Hunter, RP: Peripherals weren\u2019t much different at all from his previous two seasons, and he\u2019s still just 29 and sitting 96 with his fastball. He\u2019ll be back.\n\n103. Neal Cotts, RP: What would be the proper emoji for a reliever who allowed 12 home runs in 63 1/3 innings? The Home Alone? The lit-fuse bomb? Or just the shoulder-shrugging guy who realizes Cotts\u2019 home run rate probably will regress and he\u2019ll have a better year in 2016?\n\n104. Burke Badenhop, RP: Tons of groundballs, next to no home runs, not many strikeouts. Put him in front of a good infield defense, and he\u2019s a deal.\n\n105. David DeJesus, OF: Always a steady, league-average, high-contact bat \u2013 until last season. He\u2019s perfect as a fourth outfielder who in a pinch can start.\n\n106. Matt Joyce, OF: Absolutely lost all season in Anaheim. Just 31, Joyce should be able to find himself a job somewhere hitting right-handers.\n\n107. Matt Belisle, RP: Outside of the elbow issues that sidelined him half the season \u2013 which is baseball\u2019s version of asking Mrs. Lincoln what she thought of the play \u2013 his stuff looked good and warrants another big league season.\n\n108. Alex Avila, C: SIGNED Scary casualty of concussions as well as other nagging injuries that happen to catchers along the way. With playing time rationed properly, he could be effective once again.\n\n109. Randy Choate, RP: Best LOOGY since Pumpkin blasted New York with the drive-by.\n\n110. Justin De Fratus, RP: SIGNED Workhorse reliever who was excellent in one-inning stints and a mess when a taxed Phillies bullpen forced him to pitch a second inning.\n\n111. Bud Norris, SP: SIGNED Someone will give him an American job.\n\n112. Brandon Morrow, SP: At this point, it\u2019s rather evident he can\u2019t hold up for a season as a starter. So turn him into a power reliever, lard his contract with incentives for games pitched, unleash him and get what you can.\n\n113. Mike Aviles, UT: SIGNED Signed out of college for $1,000. Has made nearly $12 million. The face of versatility and clubhouse presence heads to Detroit.\n\nView gallery . Yes, Stephen Drew slugged 17 home runs. He also hit .201. (Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) 114. Stephen Drew, UT: We\u2019re well past No. 100. A utilityman coming off a season in which he hit 17 home runs is pretty good. Stop throwing tomatoes at me, Yankees fans.\n\n115. Jonathan Broxton, RP: SIGNED Can\u2019t think about him without thinking of this.\n\n116. Jonny Gomes, OF: Look, you\u2019re going to the playoffs if you sign him \u2013 five of his last six teams have played in the postseason \u2013 so just pony up the $2 million and get it over with.\n\n117. Aaron Harang, SP: Testing the limits of just how low a guy capable of throwing 200 innings can go.\n\n118. Joel Peralta, RP: The slowest man in baseball will try to do what just nine others did last season: Throw a pitch at 40 years old.\n\n119. Chris Denorfia, OF: Solid fourth outfielder. And that\u2019s meant as a compliment.\n\n120. Gavin Floyd, SP: When he\u2019s healthy, he pitches well. He\u2019s pretty much never healthy. Thus, the quandary.\n\n121. Sean Rodriguez, UT: SIGNED Decent utility option. Fallback career? Fighting inanimate objects.\n\n122. Joe Thatcher, RP: SIGNED Choate 2.0. landed in Cleveland.\n\n123. Edwin Jackson, SP/RP: Reinvented as a fastball-slider reliever, Jackson showed some promise last season. He\u2019s still just 32, and though his fastball velocity didn\u2019t tick up with the move to the bullpen, his nascent relief career may still have some surprises in store.\n\n124. Dale Thayer, RP: Three straight strong years at Petco Park gave way to a disappointing 2015 in which the mustachioed sidewinder stopped throwing strikes and striking hitters out.\n\n125. Ross Detwiler, SP/RP: SIGNED Only three years separated from a 3.40 ERA in the Nationals\u2019 rotation, he\u2019s got enough promise to dream on, first as a starter, then out of the 'pen as a fallback with the Indians.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\n126. Joe Beimel, RP: Second year of comeback wasn\u2019t as good as the first, but he can be a serviceable-enough lefty out of the bullpen.\n\n127. Kyle Kendrick, SP: Probably would\u2019ve preferred to have been traded to Japan than pitch in Colorado. Only once ever did a pitcher give up more home runs in as few innings as Kendrick\u2019s 33 in 142 1/3 last year.\n\n128. James Russell, RP: SIGNED Still has a better-than-average career ERA. Is left-handed. Only 29. He\u2019ll be back in the big leagues sooner than later after signing a minor-league contract with the Phillies.\n\n129. Kyle Blanks, 1B: One of those players teams still haven\u2019t given up on, even at 29 years old. Surgery on both Achilles' ended his year, but if he heals well, he\u2019ll get a crack somewhere.\n\n130. Craig Breslow, RP: Joins Cotts on the 12-homers-allowed in 60-something innings team with Ogando, Josh Tomlin, Evan Scribner, Yohan Flande, Tyler Lyons and Matt Cain.\n\n131. Jeff Francoeur, OF: Always pulls out a season just OK enough to paper over his sub-.300 OBP and buy himself another year or two in the big leagues. Vive la Francoeur!\n\n132. Ryan Vogelsong, SP: SIGNED In this century, only 24 pitchers have thrown 150-plus innings at 38 or older. Odds are against Vogelsong after a down season, but that didn't prevent the Pirates from taking a chance on him.\n\n133. Chris Heisey, OF: Plate discipline drastically improved in 2015, making him a sleeper candidate for a fourth-outfield job somewhere.\n\n134. Conor Gillaspie, 3B: White Sox brute-forced him into the lineup for three years, and it didn\u2019t work. Just 28, he\u2019ll get a few more cracks at a job.\n\n135. Wesley Wright, RP: Won\u2019t get a big league deal but will show up in the major leagues every year from now well through the 2020s if he wants. Lefties, man.\n\n136. Drew Stubbs, CF: In 123 at-bats last season, struck out 60 times. Best fits in a state with a burgeoning wind-power industry.\n\n137. Jean Machi, RP: Speaking of wind power.\n\n138.

Blaine Boyer, RP: Strikeout rate of 4.57 per nine was the worst for full-time reliever with at least 50 innings.\n\n141. Brian Duensing, RP: Strikeout rate was lower than Boyer\u2019s. Threw 48 2/3 innings.\n\n142. Edward Mujica, RP: SIGNED Something says he\u2019s not going to get a two-year deal or $9.5 million guaranteed this go-round.\n\n143. Garrett Jones, 1B: He was logging fairly regular at-bats for the Yankees as late as July, and they still made the playoffs. Impressive.\n\n144. Rickie Weeks, UT: Could potentially play himself onto a team strictly with his ability to hit left-handed pitching.\n\n145. Tom Gorzelanny, RP:SIGNED Looked like a different man as a lefty reliever until last year, when ol\u2019 Gorzelanny returned to the tune of a 5.95 ERA. He will look to rebound next season with the Indians.\n\n146. Alberto Callaspo, 3B: Has eaten himself out of the middle infield, where his flexibility helped guarantee him jobs for years. Not anymore.\n\n147. Emilio Bonifacio, UT: SIGNED Pulled off the rare feat of all three triple-slash categories in the .100s. Boni is returning to the Braves in 2016 on a one-year deal.\n\n148. Clint Barmes, SS: Glove isn\u2019t what it used to be. Bat is.\n\n149. Casey Janssen, RP: Doesn\u2019t walk anyone. Doesn\u2019t strike out anyone anymore, either, and combine that with a 30 percent groundball rate and an 88-mph fastball, and doom beckons.\n\n150.

Tim Stauffer, RP: Left San Diego, imploded. A story as old as Vin Scully.\n\n153. Bronson Arroyo, SP: Still hasn\u2019t thrown a competitive pitch after Tommy John surgery 16 months ago.\n\n154. Casey McGehee, 3B: Last time he needed to revitalize his career, McGehee spent a season in Japan. A return trip is in order.\n\n155. Hector Noesi, SP: Pitched well enough at Triple-A to get another big league sniff after bombing out of the White Sox\u2019s rotation last season.\n\n156. Jeremy Guthrie, SP: Homer-prone with a big ERA. Turns 37 shortly after opening day. Weird habit of taking pictures of sportswriters\u2019 butts, posting them to Twitter.\n\n157. Peter Moylan, RP: Got another chance with the Braves and made the most of it after Tommy John surgery. Stuff, not sentimentality, will buy him another shot at the big leagues.\n\n158. Eric O\u2019Flaherty, RP: Hasn\u2019t been the same since his Tommy John. Minor league deal likelier than not at this point.\n\n159. Bobby Parnell, RP: Ditto.\n\n160. Cory Luebke, SP: Two Tommy John surgeries later, his arm still is problematic. If he gets back to the big leagues, it\u2019s a huge success already.\n\n161. Justin Maxwell, OF: Huge raw tools make him look like a big leaguer, and then you look up and he\u2019s hitting .209/.275/.341 and you\u2019re all, \u201cYeah, not a big leaguer.\u201d\n\n162. Jonathan Herrera, UT: Every team needs a utilityman. Herrera is a utilityman. Thus, every team needs Herrera.

Lots of home runs. Lots of runs. A man of excess, which tends not to be the most desirable quality in a pitcher.\n\n168. Eric Stults, SP: If his career as a starter is done, he\u2019s still got another 10 years in his arm as a reliever.\n\n169. Andrew Bailey, RP: SIGNED Another victim of the arm. Oakland getting Josh Reddick for him is one of the better trades in recent years.\n\n170. John Mayberry Jr., OF: He hit cleanup twice for the NL pennant winners, which says far more about the Mets than it does John Mayberry Jr.\n\n171. Chris Capuano, SP/RP: Foray into the bullpen didn\u2019t go particularly well. At 37, best hope is to sign with a team that loses a few pitchers to injury in the spring.\n\n172.

Joe Nathan, RP: He\u2019s 100 spots higher if he isn\u2019t coming off a second Tommy John surgery, plus a flexor-mass repair. That surgery takes 18 months of recovery, and considering Nathan\u2019s surgery was in late April, the chances of him pitching in 2016 aren\u2019t good, though a team could lock him in for 2017 in hopes he\u2019s still pitching at age 42.\n\n186.

Captain Jamie Benn scored his NHL-leading 23rd goal and Patrick Sharp extended his point streak to five games with a goal and an assist.\n\n\"Tough to give up the point in the shootout loss, but I thought our team bounced back with a great effort at home,\" Sharp told the team's official website. \"Three of four points coming out of the (Christmas) break is good.\"\n\nNow the Stars are tasked with righting the ship on the road, where they are 1-1-2 since Dec. 4. They still have a Western Conference-best 12-3-3 road record.\n\nThe NHL's top-scoring offense at 3.46 goals per game will take its second look this month at a Columbus defense allowing an average of 3.13, second-worst in the league. That mark is up to 4.00 since Dec. 10 with a 2-6-1 record since the Blue Jackets lost top goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky to a groin injury.\n\nDallas ranks toward the top of the league with a 1.67 goals-against average since Dec. 11, allowing no more than three goals in 11 straight games. Two of the Stars' four shutouts have come within the last week as Kari Lehtonen logged Sunday's with 22 saves, and Antti Niemi made 20 in last Tuesday's 4-0 victory over the Blackhawks.\n\nIt's unclear who will start Tuesday, though Niemi earned the NHL's second star of the week after going 2-0-1 with a 1.02 GAA and .966 save percentage. But he is 1-4-0 with a 4.03 GAA in his last six games versus the Blue Jackets, while Lehtonen is 7-5-1 with a 1.85 GAA against them for his career.\n\nLehtonen made 34 saves in the first matchup between the teams Dec. 15, a 5-1 win in Dallas. Tyler Seguin tallied two goals and Johnny Oduya, Mattias Janmark and Alex Goligoski each scored.\n\nThe Blue Jackets (13-22-3), who have seven players on their roster at 23 years old or younger, have surrendered at least five goals four times in their last six games - all in regulation.\n\n''It's very frustrating ... I see weakness,'' coach John Tortorella said. ''I think we're weak mentally, and it's not the kids. I worry about the kids getting into bad habits by watching other people. That's frightening to me.''\n\nColumbus was outshot 19-1 while taking 11 minutes in penalties during the first period of Sunday's 3-2 loss at Florida. The Blue Jackets have served 71 penalty minutes in the last three games.\n\nRookie Joonas Korpisalo was pulled after allowing four goals on 27 shots against the Stars earlier this month, and Curtis McElhinney allowed a goal on seven shots in relief. Korpisalo has a 3.65 GAA in five games since being called up from the AHL after the injury to Bobrovsky, who could be on the verge of returning but is listed as day-to-day.", "Asian golfers shone in 2015, but tour outlook uncertain": "Hong Kong (AFP) - While the stars of Asian golf shone brightly in 2015, the Asian Tour heads into an uncertain new year with players unhappy with a proposed European Tour merger.\n\nOn the fairways and greens all was well, as Asian players matched their international rivals and made an impression at events across the globe.\n\nIndia's Anirban Lahiri wrapped up the Asian Order of Merit with two wins in co-sanctioned Asian-European Tour events -- the Malaysian and Indian Opens -- and a slew of top-10 finishes around the world, including an admirable fifth place at the US PGA Championship at Whistling Straits.\n\nSouth Korea's An Byeong-Hun took Rookie of the Year honours on the European Tour and carried off the biggest prize of his career with a stunning six-shot triumph at the PGA Championship at Wentworth to pocket a cool $1 million.\n\nEvergreen Thai Thongchai Jaidee showed he was still young at heart with a game to match, winning the European Open in September, recording eight top-10s and reaching a career-high world ranking of 28, at the tender age of 45.\n\nHis fellow countryman Kiradech Aphibarnrat won three times globally with nine other top-10s, while Wu Ashun became the first Chinese player to win a European Tour event on home soil when he lifted the China Open trophy in Shanghai.\n\nView gallery South Korea's An Byeong-Hun took 2015 Rookie of the Year honours on the European Tour and carrie \u2026\n\nThongchai then capped his stellar year by making his Presidents Cup debut against the United States in Incheon, South Korea, the first time the prestigious team matchplay event had been staged in Asia.\n\nThe event proved a roaring success with huge crowds and a nail-biting denouement.\n\nThe US won on the final green of the final singles match, when home favourite Bae Sang-Moon agonisingly fluffed a crucial chip to the 18th green to hand Bill Haas the winning point in a 15.5-14.5 victory.\n\nIt was a sad end for Bae, who now has his pro golf career put on hold while he serves at least 18 months compulsory national service in the South Korean military.\n\n- Merger and splits -\n\nView gallery Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee showed he was still young at heart with a game to match, winning the \u2026\n\nOff the course, meanwhile, major developments were brewing in Asia that will rumble on into 2016.\n\nIn August, the European and Asian Tours announced in a vaguely worded statement a \"joint vision\" for the future.\n\nIt soon emerged that the proposal was for a fully-fledged merger of the two organisations to form a mega-tour stretching from Ireland to the shores of the Pacific in the Far East.\n\nWhile the increased presence, sponsorship and prize money opportunities such a tour could harness were broadly welcomed by the European players, their Asian counterparts were less convinced.\n\nThe players held a long meeting at the Macau Open in October and it became clear there were deep divisions in the ranks over the merger.\n\nPlayers who ply their trade on both tours seemed in favour, but some members of the Asian Tour were scared their opportunities to make a living could be eroded by an influx of higher-ranked players from Europe.\n\nAsian Tour CEO Mike Kerr came under fire at the meeting and European Tour CEO Keith Pelley flew in to meet the players.\n\nAt the beginning of December, the Asian Tour confirmed Kerr had stepped down as CEO, without giving any reasons for his resignation, while the body's board also had a shake-up in personnel.\n\nEuropean Tour tournament committee chairman Thomas Bjorn told AFP in Thailand last week that the merger is \"the only way forward\", and said Asian players had no need to worry.\n\nIndian veteran Jeev Milkha Singh said players were awaiting the Asian Tour's next move. \"We have a new board and we will wait to see what they recommend,\" he said.", "9 little-known Amazon Prime perks": "To the record-setting 3 million folks who signed up for Amazon Prime in just the third week of December, welcome! The decade-old service is still one of the hottest subscriptions in the ecommerce space, with tens of millions of members. The company is famously cagey about details on its Prime business, but analysts estimate one in four U.S. households holds a Prime account.\n\nSo what\u2019s all the fuss about?\n\nThe star perk of the annual $99 Prime membership fee is, of course, free two-day shipping on some 20 million items, from groceries to gadgets. But there are some little known auxiliary goodies that even long-time Prime members may not know about. Here are a few:\n\nFree two-hour delivery. Amazon launched Prime Now in more than 20 metro areas last December. Exclusively offered to Prime members, the service offers free two-hour delivery on \u201ctens of thousands of items\u201d through a dedicated app. If two hours isn\u2019t fast enough for you, pay just $7.99 for one-hour delivery. Deliveries are made seven days a week from 6 a.m. to midnight. Plug in your ZIP code here to see if Amazon Now is available in your area. Pro tip: Amazon\u2019s running a promo now for $10 off your first order. Just enter the code \u201c10PRIMENOW\u201d at checkout.\n\nUnlimited photo storage.You can upload photos to Amazon\u2019s cloud service for free with a Prime membership and access your pics on your phone, computer or tablet anytime you want. You can get similar services via Google (Google Photos, launched in May, is free and offers unlimited storage) or Flickr (also free but limited to 1,000 GB of storage). But if you\u2019ve already got a Prime membership, might as well take advantage of the additional storage backup.\n\nMovie and TV streaming. With critically acclaimed original series like \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMozart in the Jungle,\u201d Amazon\u2019s unlimited streaming service is shaping up to be a true competitor to streaming giants like Hulu and Netflix. Prime membership gets you free access to tons of shows and movies. It may be a stretch to call it \u201cunlimited\u201d streaming, however, since plenty of popular shows and movies are only available to rent or buy.\n\nMusic streaming. If you don\u2019t feel like paying extra for ad-free music streaming on other services like Spotify or Pandora, Prime members can tap Amazon\u2019s huge catalogue of ad-free tunes. True music fans might be disappointed in the Amazon selection, which at about 1 million songs pales in comparison to offerings from other services like Apple Music and Spotify, which each offer more than 30 million songs. But, again, you have to pay up for those services ($9.99 a month).\n\nAdd family members for free. There\u2019s no need for everyone in your household to sign up for a $99 Prime membership. One membership can cover two adults and up to four children. The household account lets you create a \u201cfamily library\u201d where you can link two Amazon accounts and share e-books, audiobooks, apps and games on all your devices. The service also lets you control what content your kids can download on their own. All the perks that come with a Prime membership (Prime video, free shipping, music, etc.) are shared by the second adult on the family account. Kids are free to access any content available on the adult accounts.\n\nYour own digital library. If you own a Kindle, Amazon Prime gives you free access to the Kindle Owner\u2019s Lending Library. The library offers more than 800,000 e-books. You can borrow one per month and keep it for as long as you want.\n\nEarly access to lightning deals. Get a 30-minute jump on other shoppers on Amazon \u201clightning deals\u201d (items on sale for a limited time, usually a few hours). Amazon runs an assortment of lightning deals every day. The 30-minute head start is a nice advantage to have on busy shopping days like Black Friday or Cyber Monday when Amazon runs the most lightning deals of the year.\n\nPrime Pantry delivery. If you routinely shop for household goods online, Amazon\u2019s Prime Pantry service is a worthy benefit to investigate. It lets you bundle together a bunch of household items that would otherwise be too pricey to ship individually for free. The only catch is that it costs $5.99 to ship and you won\u2019t get your items for 1-4 business days. For Prime customers used to the usual free two-day shipping perk, this could be a tough charge to swallow. But if you\u2019re planning ahead and want to save yourself a trip to the store, it\u2019s not a bad deal. You can also \u201csubscribe\u201d to certain items you buy regularly, which can save you up to 15% off the retail price.\n\nStudent discount. College students can sign up for a six-month free Amazon Prime membership and thereafter pay only half the regular fee\u2014 $49 a year. True, you can always stay on your family\u2019s Prime plan, but remember, the family plan only lets two adults share key perks like free two-day shipping and Prime video streaming.\n\nRead more:\n\n22-year-old blows her $90,000 college fund and blames her parents\n\nThe most inspiring personal finance stories of 2015\n\n5 things you still can't buy with credit cards\n\nMandi Woodruff is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and host of Brown Ambition, a new podcast about career and finance.", "NFL Power Rankings: A change at the top? Nope, not necessary": "I've never been a big fan of the notion that, when it comes to rankings, when you lose matters so much.\n\nWe've all seen it before. Team A loses in Week 3. Team B loses in Week 10. Team A goes higher in the Week 11 rankings because Team B's loss was more recent. It doesn't make any logical sense. Neither does the idea that when the No. 1 team in college football or basketball rankings loses, it has to move down.\n\nSo I'm not doing that here. The Carolina Panthers have been the best team in the NFL this season, and they're not moving out of the No. 1 spot just because they lost last week.\n\nSunday's 20-13 loss at the Atlanta Falcons wasn't pretty, but it wasn't that damaging. The Panthers are still a home win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers away from clinching the No. 1 seed in the NFC. That would make them the sixth 15-1 team in NFL history. The Panthers haven't shown too many cracks all season. Losing by a touchdown at a division rival with little to play for other than the chase for 16-0 isn't some sign of impending doom. It was just a loss. Everyone else has at least two of them this season.\n\n[Yahoo Daily Fantasy: $10 could win you $20K in our $200K contest for Week 17]\n\nThe Panthers were getting everyone's best shot, especially as they got deeper into the season without a loss. In many ways the loss could help them, because now the undefeated sideshow is over. Instead of being asked constantly about a perfect season, they can just go back to being a normal (and very good) football team heading into the playoffs.\n\nIt's not to say the Panthers are unbeatable, especially if and when they face another very good team like the Arizona Cardinals, because we've seen 15-1 teams and a 16-0 team lose in the playoffs. But when you look at entire canvas, the Panthers are still the No. 1 team in the NFL. And Cam Newton is still the MVP. That doesn't change just because their loss came more recently than losses by other teams.\n\nHere are Shutdown Corner's power rankings after Week 16:\n\n32. San Francisco 49ers (4-11, Last week: 31)\n\nJarryd Hayne is back on the active roster, and he had 27 rushing yards and 20 receiving yards on five carries in Sunday's game. I hope he keeps getting chances as he learns American football, because his story is really fun.\n\n31. Cleveland Browns (3-12, LW: 30)\n\nJohnny Manziel went 13 of 32 for 136 yards on Sunday. If this last stretch was an audition, I think he needs a strong finish. Too inconsistent for a team to feel good building around him next offseason.\n\n30. Tennessee Titans (3-12, LW: 29)\n\nAt the end of the day, losing is beneficial for the Titans because of draft position. But that was one terrible, uninspiring performance. Oh well, most things in Tennessee will look different next season anyway.\n\n29. Dallas Cowboys (4-11, LW: 28)\n\nView gallery . Darren McFadden (Getty Images)\n\n28. Baltimore Ravens (5-10, LW: 32)\n\nAll I have to say is John Harbaugh is a heck of a football coach.\n\n27. Miami Dolphins (5-10, LW: 27)\n\nNot to go all Miko Grimes on you, but it's shocking how much worse Ryan Tannehill looks this season. The coaching changes haven't helped, but he took a major step back this season. Not good, right after the Dolphins gave him a big contract.\n\n26. San Diego Chargers (4-11, LW: 26)\n\nThe Chargers put four players on injured reserve. That brings their total number of players on IR to 17. That's amazing. Also worth keeping in mind as we debate the future of coach Mike McCoy.\n\n25. Jacksonville Jaguars (5-10, LW: 23)\n\nIf you watched the Saints-Jaguars game, you realize how empty Blake Bortles' 368 yards and four touchdowns were. When the game was competitive the Jaguars offense did very little. There's still a long way to go with this team. Some promising signs, but keep games like Sunday in mind if the offseason buzz on them gets louder.\n\n24. New Orleans Saints (6-9, LW: 25)\n\nI just can't imagine Drew Brees isn't back with the Saints next season, somehow. He has meant too much to that franchise and he's still playing at a very high level.\n\n23. Indianapolis Colts (7-8, LW: 19)\n\nFrank Gore had a nice 85-yard, two-touchdown day. Still, his average is a career-low 3.7 per carry and he hasn't had a 100-yard game all season. He'll be 33 next year, and you'd assume the Colts won't rely on him for 250 carries again (he has 241 carries with a game to go).\n\n22. Detroit Lions (6-9, LW: 24)\n\nHard to say if Jim Caldwell has saved his job with a few wins. I assume the new general manager will have something to say about it, though.\n\n21. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-9, LW: 18)\n\nI don't know what the Buccaneers will decide to do with free agent-to-be Doug Martin this offseason, but Charles Sims is a really good player. He's averaging 5 yards per carry and 11.6 yards per catch in a part-time role. The Bucs would be just fine with him handling the load.\n\n20. Chicago Bears (6-9, LW: 22)\n\nJay Cutler hasn't had a multi-interception game all season, and he hasn't even thrown interceptions in back-to-back games since Sept. 27-Oct. 4. It has been a very good year for Cutler. It's just disappointing that despite Cutler making major strides, the Bears still won't have a winning record.\n\n19. Philadelphia Eagles (6-9, LW: 15)\n\nZach Ertz was expected to have a nice year for the Eagles, but had just 403 yards over Philadelphia's first 12 games. But he has had 298 yards in the Eagles' last three games. Did they just forget he existed for three months?\n\n18. New York Giants (6-9, LW: 14)\n\nView gallery . Eli Manning (Getty Images)\n\n17. St. Louis Rams (7-8, LW: 21)\n\nIf only there was a way to get this team to play well every week, and not just for two or three games out of 16. If only.\n\n16. Oakland Raiders (7-8, LW: 17)\n\nLatavius Murray has averaged 4.1 yards per carry and maybe most importantly has been healthy for 15 games. He has proven a lot this season and will be just 26 next season.\n\n15. Buffalo Bills (7-8, LW: 16)\n\nIt's only 23 carries, but Mike Gillislee has a 10.4-yard average. He has looked very good. Between Gillislee and Karlos Williams, the Bills have a couple of young, intriguing backs making very little money. Makes you wonder if a team that has a lot of money already committed to the 2016 cap has any remorse over the trade and contract extension for LeSean McCoy, who has a $7.7 million cap hit next season.\n\n14. Atlanta Falcons (8-7, LW: 20)\n\nHey Falcons, thanks for playing well again after it's too late. Good win and nice for offseason momentum, but I'm sure \"offseason momentum\" wasn't what the Falcons wanted to be playing for at this point of the season after a great start.\n\n13. Houston Texans (8-7, LW: 13)\n\nIt's not totally crazy to think of DeAndre Hopkins as a dark horse MVP candidate. We all know the Texans' quarterback issues this season. Yet, Hopkins has caught at least one touchdown in six of Houston's eight wins, and had at least 94 yards in six of the Texans' eight wins.

Washington Redskins (8-7, LW: 12)\n\nThe NFC East was a joke most of the season, but Washington has played very well lately.

Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6, LW: 5)\n\nThe worst loss of any NFL team this season. Maybe for a few seasons. Totally inexcusable, with all that was on the line. Wasn't even a fluke. The Ravens had more yards, more first downs and never trailed. There needs to be a lot of soul searching in Pittsburgh this offseason if that keeps them out of the playoffs. They had a chance to make a very deep run, like a \"Wow, a wild card ended up in the Super Bowl!\" type run. What a disappointment that they probably won't even make it.\n\n10. Green Bay Packers (10-5, LW: 9)\n\nIf not for a Hail Mary victory, the Packers would be 3-6 after a 6-0 start. I wrote Sunday night about Aaron Rodgers not playing well, flawed supporting cast or not. There are no signs of this turning around. And anything less than a Super Bowl trip is disappointing after what happened in last season's NFC title game.\n\n9. New York Jets (10-5, LW: 11)\n\nView gallery .

Minnesota Vikings (10-5, LW: 10)\n\nJerick McKinnon is averaging 5.3 yards per carry. But he only has 49 carries all season because he plays behind one of the few remaining guys who can handle 325 or so carries in a year.\n\n7. Seattle Seahawks (9-6, LW: 7)\n\nThat game Sunday meant almost nothing for them, so a loss is no reason to freak out. Getting absolutely nothing out of the tailback position against the Rams is something to worry about moving forward, though.\n\n6. Kansas City Chiefs (10-5, LW: 8)\n\nThe Chiefs haven't lost since Oct. 18. The thing to watch, now that they're in the playoffs, is whether outside linebacker Justin Houston will return soon from a knee injury. He'd make them much better, and they're already pretty good.\n\n5. Cincinnati Bengals (11-4, LW: 4)\n\nAJ McCarron looked really good for a half against Denver, and then the top-ranked defense in the NFL got to him. Still was a pretty positive performance for someone in his second career start. That won't help the Bengals feel better, because their shot at a first-round bye probably vanished in Denver. And that probably hurts Andy Dalton's chances of returning for the playoff opener, without the week off.\n\n4. Denver Broncos (11-4, LW: 6)\n\nThe Brock Osweiler roller coaster keeps going. He's the only one who seems to be handling it pretty well.\n\n3. New England Patriots (12-3, LW: 2)\n\nI'm sure there are great reasons to kick off in overtime, and I'm sure Bill Belichick has thought them all through. But I'm still just doing the mindless thing and giving the ball to Tom Brady to start overtime.\n\n2. Arizona Cardinals (13-2, LW: 3)\n\nThe Packers offense seems beyond broken, but it's still a huge positive for the Cardinals defense to play that well without Tyrann Mathieu.\n\n1. Carolina Panthers (14-1, LW: 1)\n\nWhatever you thought of Carolina before Sunday, you should still think the same about them today. That loss doesn't fundamentally change anything.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nFrank Schwab is the editor of Shutdown Corner on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?

No clutch play at a key moment. No costly mistake by its opponent in the last few minutes.\n\nThe perfect start is over for Cam Newton and the Panthers.\n\nAfter Julio Jones' spectacular 70-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter gave Atlanta the lead, the Panthers came up empty in two possessions in the final three minutes as the Falcons held on for a 20-13 victory on Sunday.\n\nCarolina (14-1) got the ball for the last time with 90 seconds left and no timeouts remaining. Newton completed a 19-yard pass to Corey Brown on first down but fumbled when stripped by Vic Beasley Jr. on the following play. Adrian Clayborn recovered for the Falcons, wrapping up the win.\n\nIt was Carolina's first regular-season loss since Nov. 30, 2014, at Minnesota. The Panthers did not get into the end zone after their opening drive.\n\n''That's unacceptable, particularly at this time of the year,'' Newton said.\n\nNewton said coach Ron Rivera said the team played as if it was waiting for a turnaround that never came.\n\nNewton, the Panthers' MVP candidate with the Superman celebration pose, was just OK. He threw for 142 yards and was held without a touchdown pass for only the second time this season. He ran for 46 yards, including an 8-yard scoring run on the Panthers' opening drive.\n\nAfter that, Carolina's only points came on two second-half field goals from Graham Gano.\n\nCarolina's 13 points set a season low. The Panthers had scored at least 24 points in 13 straight games.\n\n''We're 14-1 now,'' Newton said. ''We put ourselves in a situation that we can use this as fuel to the fire.''\n\nThe Falcons (8-7) spoiled the Panthers' bid for a perfect season only two weeks after being humbled in a 38-0 loss at Carolina.\n\n''I viewed this game as a measuring stick for us,'' Atlanta coach Dan Quinn said. ''I wanted to see how our team would respond after the game up there.''\n\nMatt Ryan threw for 306 yards and one touchdown for the Falcons. Devonta Freeman ran for 73 yards and a TD.\n\nCarolina needed a win or tie or an Arizona loss or tie against Green Bay to clinch home-field advantage for the NFC playoffs. But the Cardinals (13-2) cruised to a 38-8 victory over the Packers.\n\nJones got the best of his much-anticipated matchup with Carolina cornerback Josh Norman. Jones had nine catches for 178 yards, including the dramatic touchdown catch.\n\nJones reached above linebacker Luke Kuechly for the catch as Panthers safety Kurt Coleman slipped, leaving a clear path for Jones to the end zone. The play put Atlanta ahead to stay at 14-10.\n\n''Julio made a great play on it,'' Kuechly said. ''That's really all there is. I thought I was in a good spot, but he went up and got it.''\n\nAtlanta's Shayne Graham kicked field goals of 37 and 54 yards in the final three minutes.\n\nCarolina trailed 14-10 in the fourth quarter when Ryan mishandled a shotgun snap from the Panthers 37. Norman recovered the fumble, setting up Gano's 47-yard field goal that cut Atlanta's lead to 14-13.\n\nCarolina's defense drew two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, including one on cornerback Charles Tillman that helped keep the Falcons' marathon touchdown drive alive on their first possession.\n\nThe Falcons were stopped on a third-down incomplete pass before Tillman became entangled with Atlanta wide receiver Roddy White. Tillman drew the flag to keep Atlanta's offense on the field for a 16-play, 80-yard touchdown drive that lasted more than 9 minutes. Freeman scored from the 4 on the first play of the second quarter for a 7-7 tie.\n\nRivera said he would talk with the league office about the penalty but said ''There's nothing we can do about it. We didn't get off the field. We're not making any excuses.''\n\nNOTES: The loss snaps the Panthers' streak of 18 straight regular-season wins. ... Falcons DT Paul Soliai (calf) and WR Eric Weems (concussion) left with injuries. Panthers RB Fozzy Whittaker was carted to the locker room with a right ankle injury. ... White had five catches for 67 yards.\n\n---\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL", "Is another NDSU title the tipping point?": "(STATS) - On the same night North Dakota State qualified for the FCS Championship Game two weeks ago, Mount Union captured the Division III national title for the 12th time since 1993.\n\nIf nothing else, it served as a reminder that resistance comes by the dozen (national titles).\n\nMount Union hasn't left D-III behind for a higher level of competition, even though the temptation has been there.\n\nIf it was just a football decision, then perhaps the Purple Raiders might have made a move upward.\n\nBut as the to-be-FBS-or-not-to-be decision moves closer for North Dakota State with each FCS national championship, it's not just about football.\n\nThe Bison will try to claim a record fifth straight FCS title on Jan. 9 against Jacksonville State. Either way, the topic of the Bison leaving the second-highest level in college football for the FBS won't go away any time soon.\n\nThe pressure for an NDSU move hasn't just grown because it appears to be the next obvious challenge for the Bison. Also factoring in is the FCS is lessening in strength with some of its national powers (Appalachian State and Georgia Southern in 2014) and growing powers (Old Dominion in 2013 as well as Coastal Carolina in 2017) leaving for the FBS.\n\nNDSU alumni and fans fear their school will wait too long with a move upward in the swirling Division I landscape. Unlike them, though, NDSU administrators have to be more patient with their approach.\n\nWhile Appalachian State and Georgia Southern have enjoyed quick success in their first two seasons in the FBS - in a Sun Belt Conference considered the bottom of 10-conference FBS - no school is going to replicate Boise State's FCS-to-FBS success. So a jump up still involves a school accepting being a smaller fish in the larger FBS pond.\n\nThat idea is acceptable to most schools because the money, especially through television dollars, is immense in the FBS compared to the FCS.\n\nAlong the way toward decision day, NDSU has taken calculated steps, including this summer's announcement that it will add full cost of attendance dollars (academic-related supplies, transportation and other similar items) to its 16 sports - something only Liberty had previously instituted in the FCS.\n\nAt this point, it appears prudent for NDSU to remain patient to see if college football will undergo an even more drastic change in the near future. Smaller moves have slowed; the chief question today is whether the Power 5 conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12 and SEC) break off on their own.\n\nIf so, the bottom five FBS conferences (AAC, Conference USA, MAC, Mountain West and Sun Belt) may have no choice but to merge with at least the higher-tier FCS conferences, such as NDSU's Missouri Valley Football Conference.\n\nAny NDSU decision extends way beyond the Bison football dynasty just increasing from the 63-scholarship maximum of the FCS to the 85 of the FBS. The Bison have to meet Title IX obligations, raise their fundraising substantially and fund an entire athletic budget that currently operates at around $20 million annually.\n\nTheir athletic program and national brand are thriving, much like the North Dakota economy, so signs point to NDSU having what it takes for FBS success off the field as well as on. Not all of the factors are ideal, though: Fargo isn't a great fit geographically for potential suitors such as the Big 12 and Mountain West Conference, and the Fargodome that fits just under 19,000 isn't overly compatible for expansion (try telling Oklahoma it's playing there).\n\nBut the truth is, the FBS will have a demand for North Dakota State in the future as much as today, so there's no reason for the FCS power to rush to judgment.\n\nEven if the Bison win a fifth straight national title.", "In a year of odd moves, FIFA and Al Capone become neighbors": "All across Europe and the Americas - as they plot legal strategy, await extradition hearings and consider the billable hours run up by their lawyers - FIFA officials can take comfort in this: They are serving the cause of art.\n\nThe Mob Museum in Las Vegas opened a wing this year highlighting the alleged crimes and misdemeanors of soccer's governing body. The exhibit is titled ''The 'Beautiful Game' Turns Ugly.''\n\nU.S. and Swiss authorities have cast a wide net, with 14 soccer officials and sports marketers charged in May with ''rampant, systematic and deep-rooted'' corruption. By year's end, dozens were charged and FIFA President Sepp Blatter and European soccer leader Michel Platini were banned from the sport for eight years.\n\nThe FIFA exhibit is a short kick from space occupied by Al Capone and his machine-gun trappings. It consists mostly of newspaper clippings - a ''FIFA Nostra'' headline from a French paper is one example - photos and videos. Among those noted is Jack Warner, a former FIFA vice president under indictment who once cited as fact an article in the satirical ''The Onion'' that the United States was awarded a World Cup in 2015 (a non-World Cup year).\n\nThe soccer display was designed to give museum-goers a sense of what organized crime in the 21st century may look like. Geoff Schumacher, the museum's content director, says visitors need to look beyond mobsters of yore.\n\n''You don't have Lucky Luciano or Meyer Lansky,'' he says. ''These are not household names today.''\n\nThe Mob Museum was not the only back road sports wandered down. This was also a year in which Serena Williams, in need of a little pick-me-up after losing the first set 6-0 in an Australian Open tuneup, requested a cup of espresso on the court; the Kansas State marching band was fined $5,000 for mocking its rival Jayhawk mascot with what appeared to be a phallic formation.\n\nBridge fans were slammed by a British court, which upheld a ruling that the card game is not a sport; and Canadian hockey gold medalist Meaghan Mikkelson and her husband took to Twitter for baby-name suggestions and, rest assured, did not choose Zamboni. (The winning name, however, was true to hockey - Calder.)\n\n---\n\nThe pucks, the plays, the people went every which way in 2015:\n\nView gallery FILE - In this Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2015, file photo, Items on FIFA corruption are on display at the Mo \u2026\n\nFIT TO BE THAI'D: Runners in a half-marathon in Thailand checked their watches and knew something was wrong. And they weren't pleased. By the time the race was over they had run almost 4 more miles than they should have. Like drivers hopelessly lost, they had gotten bad directions from officials along the course. Organizers apologized, and to atone for their error presented the runners with a T-shirt to ''express our admiration for your spirit in bravely overcoming the obstacles.''\n\n---\n\nTO CATCH A THIEF: Racing is hard enough in NASCAR. Even harder when you don't have a car. Team EXTREME, not one of the big boys of NASCAR, was unable to race at Atlanta Motor Speedway because thieves swiped the car from a hotel parking lot. The $250,000 car was recovered fully intact along a remote road some 20 miles away. ''I've probably been to 1,200 hotels and 1,200 race tracks,'' crew chief Peter Sospenzo said. ''Never once has this happened. It's crazy.'' ... Small-time crooks also made their way to Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The Berkshire Eagle reported a break-in at Wahconah Park, home to a college baseball summer league. Among the items stolen were sweat shirts, tank tops, shoes and 100 frozen hamburger patties. The thieves also made sure to take the buns.\n\n---\n\nEXECS BEHAVING BADLY: Maybe James Dolan should have let his PR department handle this one. A longtime Knicks fan wrote to the Madison Square Garden chairman in the middle of last season. The fan, appalled by the team's abysmal play, spelled out in a reasoned email to Dolan why he is ''utterly embarrassed by your dealings with the Knicks.'' Dolan could have replied that the team is trying to improve and make its fans proud. He took another tact. ''You most likely have made your family miserable,'' wrote Dolan, who then speculated the fan is an alcoholic and should root for the Nets. ... At least Dolan comported himself better than some Greek soccer executives. The teams Olympiakos and Panathinaikos played a game in which fans hurled rocks and bottles. Officials from the clubs met days later at a league board meeting. Peace, alas, was not at hand. The executives themselves began brawling.\n\n---\n\nOUCH-CHOO!: It's one thing to get plunked in the ribs with a fastball. It's quite another to be knocked out the lineup by a sneeze. Such was the case during spring training with Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar. A sneeze - presumably one of All-Star quality - brought a sharp pain to his right side. Pillar, well aware this wasn't the most heroic of injuries, could soon be spotted wearing a T-shirt that said: ''Ask Me About My Sneeze.''\n\n---\n\nTHERE SHE IS: Miss America Betty Cantrell might have been on surer ground at the pageant if she were asked her thoughts for world peace. Instead, she was asked if Patriots quarterback Tom Brady cheated by using deflated footballs. ''I'd have to see the ball and feel it,'' she said tentatively. '' If there's any question, then yes, he cheated.'' Cantrell later brooded over her reply, wondering if it could cost her the crown. She acknowledges she had a ''very slim'' grasp of the facts, and ''hopefully the Tom Brady fans will forgive me.'' Perhaps she had in mind Patricia M. Shong of Auburn, Massachusetts. In her obituary, Boston.com reported, the 72-year-old woman was said to enjoy scrapbooking and her weekly card night. She also wanted to ''set the record straight. Brady is innocent!!''\n\n---\n\nDEAR OLD DAD: You would have thought he would be beaming that his son was about to sign with Liverpool for more than $7 million. But Goran Grujic insisted that 19-year-old son Marko Grujic should stay with the Serbian soccer club Red Star Belgrade until the season's end. The father was so emphatic he forbade his son to leave. ''His passport is with me,'' the father told Belgrade media. ''And he is not going anywhere.''\n\n---\n\nANIMAL HOUSE: Post time at Presque Isle Downs & Casino in Pennsylvania was moved up a few hours to avoid racing at dusk. That's when the deer perk up. Deer had been running in front of horses, forcing races to be canceled, the Erie Times-News wrote. Said Heriberto Rivera, East Coast manager for the Jockeys' Guild: ''You can't have animals weighing hundreds of pounds crossing in front of you when you're going 35 to 40 miles an hour.'' ... Boston Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask knows all about nets, although not the kind to catch wasps. A new species of the winged insect in Kenya was named in his honor. A researcher on the discovery team is from Newton, Massachusetts, and is a great admirer of Rask's glove work. The addition to waspdom is the Thaumatodryinus tuukkaraski.\n\n---\n\nMERCY, MERCY: Sometimes, it can't possibly get worse, and then it does. The Federated States of Micronesia soccer team opened the Pacific Games with a 31-0 loss to Tahiti. Then it was pummeled 38-0 by Fiji in an Olympic qualifier. The bombardment was not over. Micronesia then fell 46-0 to Vanuatu. Perhaps the Micronesians can look to the University of Tokyo baseball team for hope. This year the school - the country's elite university - ended a 94-game losing streak with a 6-4 victory over Hosei University.\n\n---\n\nContributing to this report were: Kimberly Pierceall in Las Vegas; Jocelyn Gecker in Bangkok; Paul Newberry in Atlanta; and Marcela Isaza in Los Angeles.", "The Top 25 Baseball Stories of 2015 \u2014 #19: The Cardinals hack the Astros database": "We\u2019re a few short days away from 2016 so it\u2019s a good time to look back at the top 25 baseball stories of 2015. Some of them took place on the field, some of them off the field and some of them were creatures of social media, fan chatter and the like. No matter where the story broke, however, these were the stories baseball fans were talking about most this past year.\n\nIn June two of my favorite forms of entertainment \u2014 baseball and espionage thrillers \u2014 converged as it was revealed that employees of the St. Louis Cardinals hacked into the scouting and analytics database of the Houston Astros.\n\nThe fact that someone hacked into the Astros\u2019 \u201cGround Control\u201d database, which is the club\u2019s internal communication and evaluation system, had been known since 2014. No one suspected that the hackers were employed by another major league team until it was reported that the FBI was investigating, however. That\u2019s when it was revealed that the focus of the investigation was the Cardinals organization.\n\nThe alleged impetus for the hack was both (a) concern that former Cards executive Jeff Luhnow took proprietary information with him when he left for Houston to become the Astros\u2019 GM; and (b) lingering resentment over Lunhow\u2019s tenure with the Cardinals, where he was reported to have been a polarizing figure. It was not a sophisticated hack, apparently, and there has been no indication that the Cards\u2019 top brass directed it or were aware of it. So far the top head to roll has been Cardinals scouting director Chris Correa who was fired after an \u201cimposed leave of absence\u201d and who was reported to have admitted to breaking into the system.\n\nIt\u2019s been over six months since the news broke, but the investigation is still ongoing. Law enforcement has not said anything, as they are likely considering whether to charge anyone with a crime (and make no mistake: it is a crime to hack into a baseball team\u2019s database). Major League Baseball has kept mum about it as well. For now, we wait.\n\nAnd when the waiting is over, what then? Perhaps an arrest or an indictment from the feds. Perhaps some penalties leveled upon the Cardinals by major league baseball, possibly in the form of financial or draft pick compensation. Perhaps more firings.\n\nIn the meantime: a lot of seminars about password and network security in major league front offices.\n\nFollow @craigcalcaterra", "Jets move into playoff position, 26-20 in OT over Patriots": "NFL Media's Charley Casserly joins \"Around The NFL\" to discuss how far the Cincinnati Bengals can go with quarterback AJ McCarron.\n\nHow far can Mccarron take the Bengals?\n\nNFL Media's Judy Battista joins \"Around the NFL\" to share how the New York Jets have elevated their game and explains why the Jets\u2019 offense has been the key to their recent success.\n\nAre the Jets peaking at the right time?\n\nHow bad is AJ McCarron's wrist injury?

(AP) -- The Patriots gave the Jets the ball, and New York might carry it right into the playoffs.\n\nEric Decker's 6-yard touchdown catch on the first drive of overtime - after New England stunningly chose to kick off - lifted the Jets to a 26-20 victory Sunday that put New York in position to make the playoffs.\n\nA win next week at Buffalo gives the Jets a wild-card berth.\n\n''It was thrilling,'' Decker said. ''Those are the moments that you cherish.''\n\nNew England (12-3) won the OT coin toss and elected to kick to the Jets (10-5). Patriots coach Bill Belichick (BeliKICK?) said there was ''no confusion'' on the call; he'd done it once before in 2013, but a hefty wind was involved against Denver. That decision worked, this one flopped.\n\nSpecial teams captain Matthew Slater called heads and won the toss. He told referee Clete Blakeman the Patriots wanted to kick in a specific direction. But once he said they wanted to kick, whatever followed didn't matter, according to NFL officiating chief Dean Blandino.\n\n''I just thought we would be able to choose the direction we kicked off from,'' Slater said.\n\nIt was the third time since the 2012 rule change a team chose to kick off for OT. The other times, New England and Minnesota, were winners.\n\nNew York used a career-long 48-yard reception by Quincy Enunwa and a 20-yard pass to Brandon Marshall to move into scoring position. And then, Ryan Fitzpatrick hit Decker on a fade behind Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler for New York's fifth straight victory.\n\n''The last five weeks, they've all kind of been do-or-die games for us, so that's how we've approached each one,'' Fitzpatrick said. ''We've got to get the next one to get in and that's how we'll view it. This is a fun run.''\n\nMarshall had two touchdown catches and also became the first NFL player with 100 receptions in six seasons. Fitzpatrick tied a franchise record with 29 TD throws this season.\n\nNeither has been to the playoffs in a combined 21 pro seasons.\n\n''It feels real good,'' Marshall said. ''I'm so proud of my teammates. ... I've never been more proud to be on a ballclub like this.''\n\nTom Brady hit James White for a 9-yard score with 1:55 to go, forcing OT. That was the only drive on which Brady got comfortable against an aggressive defense that pressured and hit him all game.\n\nIt was also the most impact Rob Gronkowski had for the undermanned Patriots, who were missing top wideouts Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola. The tight end had an 8-yard reception on fourth-and-1, then a 26-yarder to set up the touchdown.\n\n''I think we have some mental toughness,'' Brady said. ''A lot of guys have been in and out of the lineup. We have a lot of guys coming in off the street trying to play.''\n\nNew England was surprisingly conservative on offense in the first quarter, then went the other way in the second period. Brady threw deep for the first time, connecting with Gronkowski, early in the quarter. The next play was a flea flicker that failed, followed by a reverse to Brandon LaFell for 9 yards and a run out of the wildcat by running back Brandon Bolden - with Brady spread wide right.\n\nSome normalcy returned on fourth down with Brady's pass to James White for 13 yards, but New York's defense held and Stephen Gostkowski made a 35-yard field goal. He also kicked a 44-yarder.\n\nThe Jets weren't restrained on offense even after top back Chris Ivory left in the second quarter with a right knee problem. With strong contributions from Bilal Powell and former Patriot Stevan Ridley, the Jets marched 80 yards and went ahead 10-3 on Marshall's 2-yard reception, when he stretched his long right arm over the goal line before going out of bounds.\n\nThe halftime margin was New York's biggest over the Patriots since a 2010 playoff game the Jets won in Foxborough.\n\nTheir other points came on Randy Bullock's field goals of 30 and 49 yards.\n\nIvory returned in the second half and Marshall's 33-yard TD reception on which he appeared to push off safety Duron Harmon made it 17-3. It was his career-best 13th TD catch of the season and his 99th reception overall.\n\nJamie Collins' 14-yard fumble return on a third-quarter sack of Fitzpatrick by Jabaal Sheard made it 17-13. The nervousness among Jets fans in the crowd was palpable at that point.\n\nIt was over the edge in the Patriots' 66-yard drive to tie it.\n\nBut when Decker scored, Jets players stormed the field, leaping and hugging as if they'd made the playoffs. Could happen, thanks greatly to their archrival's overtime decision.\n\nNOTES: New England sustained more injuries.

Fitzpatrick tied the team TDs passing record by Vinny Testaverde in 1998. ... Marshall had eight receptions for 115 yards, Fitzpatrick threw for 296 yards. ...

(AP) -- Sean Payton wants to leave as little doubt as possible about the Saints' prospects for success in 2016.\n\nAvoiding double-digits in the loss column certainly wouldn't hurt.\n\n''Perception is important and I think how you finish the season is important,'' Payton said Monday. ''You work so long and to put the hours in - the players and coaches and everyone involved do. The taste in your mouth if you don't have success is terrible.''\n\nWhen the Saints (6-9) close out an otherwise disappointing, non-playoff season in Atlanta on Sunday, they'll have a chance to consolidate recent gains and improve the perception of the progress being made in New Orleans.\n\nA win would send New Orleans into the offseason with three victories in four games. The Saints would also avoid what would otherwise be the first season with as many as 10 losses since 2005 - the year before Payton and record-setting quarterback Drew Brees arrived.\n\n''The difference between 7-9 or 6-10 is a big deal,'' Saints safety Kenny Vaccaro said.

But he was released the day before the regular-season opener and not brought back until Khiry Robinson's broken leg in midseason. He's been a pivotal player in each of New Orleans' last two victories.\n\n''I have no hard feelings,'' Hightower said. ''I'm just thankful that things worked out where I was able to come back.''\n\nIn a week's time, the Saints will be done with 2015 and starting the evaluations of which players they want back and which ones they want to attract. Regardless of whether they win or lose Sunday, Payton said no one should be questioning the ownership's stability and desire to win; the competence of the management; or his own desire to keep coaching in New Orleans long past this season - even if he hasn't exactly ruled out entertaining other opportunities that may come up.\n\n''I don't think there is any gray area about where we are going as a franchise,'' Payton said. ''We've had great stability with ownership and leadership here from the top down, and I think it's been a plus for us, not a detriment.''\n\n---\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL", "Sources: Suns ask Markieff Morris to apologize to team as condition of return": "Suspended Phoenix Suns forward Markieff Morris could return to practice Tuesday if a meeting with team officials goes well, a league source told Yahoo Sports.\n\nView photo . Markieff Morris (left) was suspended for throwing a towel at coach Jeff Hornacek. (AP) Denver Nuggets on Wednesday. Suns general manager Ryan McDonough has asked Morris to briefly meet with him, Hornacek and team president Lon Babby prior to Tuesday's practice, the source said. Morris has been told he will be asked to apologize to his Suns coaches and teammates, make a renewed commitment to the team for games, practices, weight-training sessions and treatment sessions and attend all NBA and Suns community appearances, the source said.\n\nMorris is expected to attend the meeting on Tuesday and do what is needed to return to practice afterward, the source said. Still, some within Morris' camp are confused by the team's requests because Morris already apologized to Hornacek and his teammates on Twitter and sent a separate apologetic text to Hornacek. Morris also has spoken with his teammates regularly during the suspension that cost him $145,455, the source said.\n\nMorris repeatedly tweeted his desire to be traded after the Suns dealt his twin brother, Marcus, to the Detroit Pistons in the offseason. Markieff Morris averaged career-highs of 15.3 points and 6.2 rebounds last season with Phoenix. This season, however, the fifth-year NBA veteran, has lost his starting job, was benched for several games and is averaging 10.8 points and 4.8 rebounds.\n\nMorris recently told Yahoo Sports that Hornacek told him he cut his playing time because he wasn't playing as well as expected and wanted to give the Suns' younger forwards a chance.\n\n\"I just keep working hard,\" Morris told Yahoo Sports on Dec. 16. \"[Not playing] me is their decision. The only thing I can do is keep working hard and keep getting better.\n\n\"I've been through way worse than this. Way tougher stuff than this. On a scale of 1 to 10, this is like a 2 to me.

The Suns also fired Hornacek's top two assistant coaches in Mike Longabardi and Jerry Sichting on Sunday while promoting assistant coaches Nate Bjorkgren and Earl Watson.\n\nWhen asked if he was eager for a trade, Morris told Yahoo Sports on Dec. 16: \"I'm just eager to get back on the court whether it is with the Suns or somebody else.

That was followed by the mysterious disappearance of thousands of emails that might have shed light on who was behind the targeting.\n\nThe controversy prompted congressional Republicans to repeatedly slash the agency\u2019s operating budget and subpoena senior IRS officials involved in the improper conduct. It also spawned a number of proposals by Sen.

And the IRS stressed in a statement that the new procedure would be strictly voluntary on the part of the non-profits.\n\n\n\nBut as The Hill reported on Monday, alarm bells are going off,\n\n\n\nRelated: U.S. Urged to Tighten Cyber Security to Counter Chinese Hacking\n\nOfficials of non-profits warn that the new rule would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on donations and would depress funding for programs that assist the nation\u2019s most vulnerable people, at a time when the economic recovery remains uneven.\n\n\u201cThat means a child will go without a meal or a family will go without shelter, or a senior citizen will go without life-saving medical care,\u201d said Tim Delaney, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits.\n\nOf equal concern to many of the charitable and non-profit groups is the threat of hacking if they begin building databases containing the Social Security numbers of all of their donors.

He will be there again this Dec. 31, but this time it won\u2019t be for an MMA fight.\n\n\u201cAt IGF on the New Year\u2019s Eve, I will be doing a professional wrestling show. The fans always enjoy watching, so I am happy to do this.\u201d\n\nRELATED > Fedor Emelianenko Finally Gets An Opponent for His NYE Return\n\nWhile he was in Singapore, Aoki had a chance to work with one of the most successful practitioners from the sport of wrestling, not the entertainment side of things. He was training at Evolve MMA while Ben Askren prepared for his aborted fight with Luis Santos and described it as an eye-opening experience.\n\n\u201cI had the opportunity to train with Ben Askren and seeing his technique every day at Evolve MMA had a significant impact on me. His style is something I would like to try and emulate.\u201d\n\nSakuraba retains legendary status in the sport after his battles with Royler Gracie, Royce Gracie, and Renzo Gracie. He\u2019s also shared a ring with the likes of Igor Vovchanchyn, Quinton Jackson, Wanderlei Silva, Mirko Filipovic, Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira, and Ken Shamrock, but the Japanese veteran turned 46 earlier this year.\n\nAt 32, Aoki is still in his athletic prime. He\u2019s riding an eight-fight winning streak and is the reigning lightweight champ with Asia\u2019s leading MMA promotion, ONE Championship, so he isn\u2019t contemplating retirement right now. Whether or not he will still be going strong at Sakuraba\u2019s age remains to be seen, but he plans to play it by ear.\n\n\u201cI will see how I feel at the end of every year and decide about fighting. At the moment, I feel very good.\u201d\n\nOnce his fight with Sakuraba is out of the way, Aoki can start thinking about his next ONE Championship title defense. There are a number of contenders emerging with Adrian Pang and Lowen Tynanes leading the way, while Ariel Sexton is also coming off back-to-back wins.\n\nAoki outpointed Koji Ando in his most recent defense, and thinks that next in line is the Australian.\n\n\u201cMy next opponent I think will be Adrian Pang.\u201d\n\nThe last time Aoki fought at welterweight was in 2009, and he even dropped to 145 pounds for a one-off bout two years ago. However, for Rizin FF, the former Dream, Shooto, and WAMMA champion will be tipping the scales at possibly the highest weight of his entire career.\n\n\u201cThe fight with Sakuraba-San is a catchweight, 78 kilograms (172 pounds).\u201d\n\nONE Championship recently released its 2016 schedule, which involves shows in ten different cities across Asia. Tokyo wasn\u2019t one of the destinations and Aoki is unsure when Asia\u2019s biggest MMA promotion will be heading to his homeland.\n\nRELATED > ONE Championship Bans Dehydration Weight Cutting\n\n\u201cI would be happy if ONE could do an event here, but there are a lot of serious things that need to be done in Japanese MMA first.\u201d\n\nRizin FF was founded earlier this year by former Pride Fighting Championship president Nobuyuki Sakakibara. Fedor Emelianenko is on board and the organization has aspirations to recreate the glory days of Japanese MMA. Aoki doesn\u2019t know whether or not this is possible, but he\u2019s happy for the promotion\u2019s effort.\n\n\u201cI do not know whether Rizin will be able to make Japanese MMA great again, but I do believe it is a good thing that they are trying.\u201d\n\n(Follow @JamesGoyder on Twitter)\n\nFollow MMAWeekly.com on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram", "Flyers-Sharks Preview": "The San Jose Sharks looked sluggish throughout one of their worst efforts of the season following the holiday break as their inexplicable home struggles continued.\n\nTime off didn't prove any better for the Philadelphia Flyers, who could be undergoing a bit of a roster shake-up.\n\nSan Jose looks to snap a four-game home losing streak by beating Philadelphia for a fifth straight time Wednesday night.\n\nNo longer are opponents intimidated by the SAP Center, where the Sharks (17-16-2) for years dominated on home ice. They own the league's worst home record at 4-10-0 and are still involved in a tight Pacific Division race largely because they're tied for the second-most road victories.\n\nSan Jose went 3-1-1 on a road trip before the break, then returned Monday with a 6-3 home loss to Colorado. It hadn't allowed a power-play goal in any of its previous seven before allowing four while taking six penalties - four in the first period - against the Avalanche.\n\nThe Sharks, who tied their season high for goals allowed, hadn't given up more than two power-play goals in a game all season.\n\n''When you take tripping, hooking or holding penalties, to me, you're not moving your feet,'' coach Peter DeBoer said. ''I liked the way we started. Our penalty kill has been arguably the best in the league over the last two months. They were making plays through us. That's a bad formula.\"\n\nMartin Jones faced a tough task with the Sharks short-handed so often and has a 3.96 goals-against average over his last four starts.\n\nMelker Karlsson scored in overtime and Jones made 34 saves in a 1-0 win over Philadelphia on Nov. 19 for San Jose's fourth straight victory in the series. The Flyers (15-13-7) rank near the bottom of the league in scoring and failed to reach three goals for the third time in four games in Sunday's 4-2 loss at Anaheim.\n\nJakub Voracek and Michael Raffl scored for Philadelphia, which was coming off a 3-0-1 stretch prior to the holiday break.\n\n\"We're still a confident team right now and we're confident we can beat anybody,\" Voracek said. \"We just have to make sure we put a lot of work in and get back at it.\"\n\nCoach Dave Hakstol hinted at adjusting his lines at Tuesday's practice but didn't discuss specifics. What's more clear is that changes should be coming to the defense.\n\nMark Streit has been on long-term injured reserve with a groin injury since mid-November and is ready to return. The Flyers need to clear cap space in order to have Streit and rookie standout Shayne Gostisbehere on the roster, forcing them to place forward Sam Gagner on waivers.\n\nGagner had five points in 18 games before suffering a concussion Nov. 23. He hasn't played since, and if he clears waivers he'll likely play for the club's AHL affiliate.\n\n\"We've kept our forward group pretty similar over the last little while here,\" Hakstol said. \"I'm not saying we're definitely going to make a lineup change up front, but it's on the table and it's a possibility. Probably won't make that decision until we get to game day.\"\n\nThe Flyers have dropped three straight on the road and could give Steve Mason a fifth consecutive start in goal. Mason made 20 saves in the first meeting and has a 1.59 GAA in his last three against the Sharks.", "NBA Stock Watch: C.J. McCollum rising, Victor Oladipo falling": "STOCK UP\n\nC.J. McCollum: He\u2019s averaged 22.3 points, 3.0 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 1.3 steals and 3.1 threes while shooting 48.6 percent from the floor and 83.3 percent from the line over his last eight games, when he\u2019s been a top-15 fantasy player. Many predicted a breakout season from the third-year player with LaMarcus Aldridge, Wesley Matthews and Nicolas Batum all leaving Portland, but he\u2019s been even better than his biggest optimists expected, as McCollum had an ADP of 103 and is the No. 35 ranked player this year. And if Damian Lillard continues to miss time with plantar fasciitis, McCollum\u2019s Usage Rate is going to be through the roof. He\u2019s not someone to sell high.\n\n[Don\u2019t miss Yahoo\u2019s NBA free roll on Christmas. Join our $25K Stocking Stuffer Contest]\n\nTyreke Evans: Over the last seven games, he\u2019s averaged 19.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.9 steals, 0.4 blocks and 1.7 threes, a span in which he\u2019s been the No. 11 ranked fantasy player, essentially tied with Russell Westbrook and LeBron James. Evans is sure to regress, but he\u2019s apparently fully recovered from his offseason knee surgery, which is especially surprising since he returned sooner than expected. The Pelicans have a top-10 Pace this year, and Evans has clearly been a beneficiary.\n\nJ.J. Barea: He scored a career-high 32 points while handing out 11 assists and making 5-of-7 shots from downtown Wednesday filling in for an injured Deron Williams. Barea has been a top-90 player over the past two weeks on a per-36 minute basis, and he could be looking at a major playing time increase with the oft-injured Williams headed for an MRI after hearing a \u201cpop\u201d when he hurt his hamstring Tuesday. Barea is owned in just 4% of Yahoo leagues and will be worth adding in deeper formats as long as Williams is sidelined.\n\nDennis Schroder: He\u2019s been a top-80 player over the past two weeks (ahead of Kyle Lowry and Al Horford), when he\u2019s averaged 12.5 points, 4.9 assists, 1.6 steals and 1.3 three-pointers despite seeing just 21.7 minutes. Over this span, Schroder ranks as the No. 29 fantasy player on a per-36 minute basis. Plus, he lost a tooth and just stuffed it into his sock during a recent game. He\u2019s owned in only 23% of Yahoo leagues, which makes sense thanks to his limited minutes coming off the bench, but Schroder just turned 22 years old and continues to improve. He\u2019s worth using in deeper leagues and would be a must add in the shallowest of formats if Jeff Teague were to go down.\n\nKantavious Caldwell-Pope: Over the last two weeks, he\u2019s gotten 17.7 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 3.0 apg, 1.6 spg, 0.7 bpg and 2.1 3pt while shooting 80.6% from the charity stripe. KCP has seen a whopping 39.9 mpg and committed 1.1 tpg over this span, when he ranked as the No. 31 player. He\u2019s been a top-75 player this season, which is nearly 50 spots higher than his ADP.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nVictor Oladipo: If you had me name one player to have a major breakout this season, it would\u2019ve been Oladipo. Instead, the former No. 3 overall pick has been knocked out of the starting lineup, and while new coach Scott Skiles can be frustrating with his decisions, this move actually seems somewhat warranted (at least based solely on this year\u2019s performance). Over the past two weeks, Oladipo is shooting an ugly 36.1% from the field while averaging more turnovers per game (2.4) than free throw attempts (1.6). He\u2019s absolutely a buy low candidate, but those who spent a third-round pick on him have gotten a player who hasn\u2019t ranked in the top-100 over the last month.\n\nTim Duncan: He remains a legend, and the Spurs a terrifying team generally getting overlooked right now, but it appears age and the addition of LaMarcus Aldridge as well as the emergence of Kawhi Leonard are catching up to Duncan\u2019s fantasy value. He\u2019s scored double digits in just one of his past nine games and is getting career lows in ppg (9.1) and mpg (26.3). Duncan has averaged 7.1 field goal attempts per game this season, which is behind Allen Crabbe and outside the top-120 in the NBA.\n\nZach Randolph: Like Duncan, it appears age is catching up to Randolph, whose 13.0 ppg and 8.3 rpg are both his second-lowest marks in a decade. Those numbers are down to 10.4 and 6.3 since he was moved to the bench seven games ago, when he\u2019s been the No. 124 ranked player. Memphis\u2019 Offensive Efficiency is in the bottom-five in the league, and while never known for his defensive stats, it\u2019s still crazy Randolph\u2019s block Wednesday was just his second of the season.\n\nTerrence Jones: Most expected further growth from Jones, who was a top-70 player in modest minutes (27.0) last season during his third year in the league. But his production has been down across the board in 2015/16 despite seeing a career high in Usage Rate (18.3). His minutes are especially down of late, seeing just 17.1 over the past six games. Jones had an ADP of 94 but is currently not worth owning in most formats.\n\nJ.R. Smith: He thrived after joining Cleveland last season, hitting 2.8 threes per game, and there was plenty reason to expect even more production in the beginning of this year with Kyrie Irving and Iman Shumpert sidelined, but instead he\u2019s been just the No. 140 ranked player. Smith dealt with knee and thumb injuries earlier in the year, but he\u2019s been in an extreme shooting slump of late, making just 35.1% of his shots over the past nine games. With Irving back, Smith\u2019s Usage Rate is about to go down as well.\n\nFollow Dalton Del Don on Twitter.", "Canadiens-Panthers Preview": "The Montreal Canadiens' collapse was a boon for the red-hot Florida Panthers.\n\nThe Panthers look to extend their longest winning streak in almost eight years Tuesday night against the Canadiens, who are trying to build on their first win in seven games.\n\nMontreal (21-14-3) opened the season with nine straight wins and was atop the Atlantic Division at 19-4-3 following a win over Columbus on Dec. 1. The Canadiens followed that by losing 10 of 11 games and six in a row before beating Tampa Bay 4-3 in a shootout Monday.\n\n\"It's nice to see the big smiles and hear the music after the game because it was well deserved,\" coach Michel Therrien said.\n\nFlorida (20-12-4) has been doing plenty of smiling during Montreal's struggles. The Panthers were sixth in the division, 16 points back of the Canadiens on Nov. 27 before a 12-3-0 stretch.\n\nThey've won six straight for the first time since a seven-game winning streak from March 2-16, 2008.\n\nFlorida outshot Columbus 19-1 and scored twice in the first period en route to a 3-2 win Sunday. That put the Panthers atop the division, but Montreal reclaimed the lead by one point Monday.\n\n\"It's exciting,\" coach Gerard Gallant said. \"It's almost a new year and being in first place means a lot.\"\n\nAleksander Barkov recorded his first two-goal game of the season Sunday. The center has scored seven of his nine goals at home, but the venue hasn't mattered against the Canadiens. He has three goals and one assist in the last four overall matchups.\n\nJonathan Huberdeau leads Florida with 19 assists, tallying five over the past four games after setting up both of Barkov's scores Sunday. He has six assists in his last five meetings with Montreal.\n\nThe Panthers have lost six of their last seven meetings with the Canadiens, including four straight at home while being outscored 12-5.\n\nMontreal is aiming for back-to-back wins for the first time since a four-game streak from Nov. 20-27.\n\nThe Canadiens may have Ben Scrivens in net for the first time after acquiring him from Edmonton in exchange for Zack Kassian on Monday. He served as the backup to rookie Mike Condon, who made 36 saves and turned aside two of three shootout attempts against the Lightning.\n\nScrivens, who also has spent time with Los Angeles and Toronto, hasn't played in the NHL this season, going 2-6-1 with a 3.47 goals-against average with AHL Bakersfield.\n\nHe's 3-1-0 with a 1.51 GAA and two shutouts in four career starts against the Panthers.\n\nCondon had been getting the bulk of the playing time with Carey Price (leg) out.\n\nMax Pacioretty leads Montreal with 14 goals and 28 points, but he's only managed one goal and two assists in the past 12 games. He showed signs of pulling out of his funk Monday, setting up Dale Weise's game-tying tally with 5:46 left in regulation before netting the decisive shootout try.\n\nPacioretty has 13 points in 22 career meetings with the Panthers, but just four in 12 visits to Florida - none in the last three.\n\nTomas Plekanec had one goal and two assists in a 4-1 win at BB&T Center on April 5. He enters this one after scoring his first goal in 22 games Monday.", "Cal's Jared Goff throws for 6 TDs in Armed Forces Bowl win": "View photo . FORT WORTH, TX - DECEMBER 29: Jared Goff #16 of the California Golden Bears looks for an open receiver against \u2026\n\nGoff, Cal\u2019s junior quarterback, is considered a top NFL draft prospect and showed why in a 55-36 win over Air Force. Goff threw for 467 yards and six touchdowns on the afternoon, carving up the Falcons secondary with ease. Goff\u2019s six touchdown passes give him the Pac-12 record for most in a single season with 43.\n\nGoff spread the ball around to a bevy of targets, led by Bryce Treggs, Kenny Lawler and Darius Powe. Treggs led the way with 143 yards and a touchdown while Lawler and Power hauled in three and two touchdowns apiece.\n\nIn all, the Golden Bears put up a whopping 586 yards offensively and scored on six straight possessions between the second and third quarters, not including the end of the first half.\n\nAir Force used its triple option attack to put up big yardage too (434 total), but was ultimately doomed by three turnovers \u2013 two fumbles and an interception. Both fumbles proved costly. The first came in the second quarter immediately after Cal took a 21-14 lead when Falcons quarterback Karson Roberts botched a handoff to his fullback. One play later, Goff threw his third touchdown pass of the half \u2013 a beautiful 24-yard strike to Lawler \u2013 to increase the lead to 28-14.\n\nThis is like a video game.Jared Goff to Kenny Lawler. pic.twitter.com/K1yAAJBFYu \u2014 Dr. Saturday (@YahooDrSaturday) December 29, 2015\n\nAir Force\u2019s second fumble basically erased all hopes of a comeback.\n\nIt came after Cal expanded its lead to 42-21 early in the third quarter.

Total returns are generated from combining equities and fixed-income securities actively managed to achieve a balance of income, income growth and capital preservation. The objective of total return or balanced funds is to generate a current income that can satisfy a desired drawdown percentage while growing capital at a rate to keep up with inflation.\n\nThere are dozens of funds in this particular category, but these three funds are among the best for combining consistent performance and low cost, which are critical to a retirement portfolio. Any of these funds can be considered core holdings for a retirement income portfolio, or the three together could form a diversified foundation for long-term total returns.\n\nVanguard Wellesley Income Fund\n\nIt is generally not recommended, but if you only wanted to own one mutual fund in your retirement account, the Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund may be your best candidate. The fund uses a balanced approach that favors fixed-income securities (66%) over equities (33%) to generate high, sustainable current income along with moderate capital appreciation. The fund's objective is to seek consistent total returns that can keep up with inflationary pressures while maintaining a low volatility posture. This is accomplished by spreading its $40 billion of assets among nearly 1,400 different holdings across investment-grade corporate bonds, U.S. government bonds and large-cap U.S. stocks. Its stock portfolio emphasizes stocks of companies that pay above-average dividends or have an expectation of increasing dividends over time.\n\nAlthough the fund is heavily weighted toward bonds, it consistently performs as well as many stock funds. As of December 2015, it has generated an average annual return of 6.72% over the last 10 years and 7.36% over the last five years. For such a well-managed active fund, its expense ratio is a bargain at 0.25%.\n\nT. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund\n\nIf you need high current income, the T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund has proven it can deliver. The fund can be especially attractive to investors who feel the stock market may have a bumpy ride ahead. With its concentration of large-cap dividend stocks, the fund's managers believe that increasing dividends will be a major contributor to total returns over time. Dividends also help to minimize portfolio volatility while providing a cushion for price declines. The fund is very selective, investing in just 111 securities with attention to large-cap companies that have long dividend-paying histories, such as Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, PepsiCo and Well Fargo. The fund has performed well, returning 7.28% annually over the last 10 years and 13% annually over the last five years. Its 0.65% expense ratio is fairly reasonable compared with other funds in its category.\n\nSchwab Balanced Fund\n\nDozens of funds are in the balanced category, but few stand out for their consistent performance at a low cost as much as the Schwab Balanced Fund. As a balanced fund, its objective is to generate income growth on top of current income while preserving capital. It utilizes a fund-of-funds approach by investing in a diversified group of other Schwab or Laudus funds to achieve its objective. It is more heavily weighted toward equities than fixed-income securities with a 55/65% to 35/45% allocation. At any given time, the fund invests a minimum of 25% in equities and 25% in fixed-income securities, but it has the flexibility to get defensive by investing as much as 100% of its assets in cash or short-term obligations. Over the past decade, the fund has returned 5.13%, and it has returned 9.04% over the past five years. It has a 0.62% expense ratio, which is fairly low for its category.", "Reuters U.S. Sports Schedule at 2 PM EST on Monday, Nov. 30": "Nov. 30 (Reuters) - Reuters U.S. sports schedule at 2 PM ET on Monday:\n\n- - - -\n\nThe duty editor is Steve Ginsburg, 202-898-8427\n\n- - - -\n\nNATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE\n\nRavens at Browns\n\nCLEVELAND - Josh McCown helped the Browns to a win over the Baltimore Ravens on Oct. 11, Cleveland's most recent victory, and the quarterback returns to the lineup following Johnny Manziel's week to forget with a chance to guide a season sweep over an AFC North rival.

The 2005 edition was even closer, with Eto\u2019o polling 108 points against Drogba\u2019s 106.\n\nEver since, there has always been an outright favourite, even from when the initial nominees are made public.\n\nThis year, there is no outright favourite, and while Andre Ayew looks like a safe bet to finish third, it's impossible to predict whether Yaya Toure or Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will claim continental gold.\n\nToure has won it for the past four editions and would become the first player to win it five times if he wins it again on January 7. However, has Aubameyang not been the better and more influential player in 2015?\n\nBoth players have had varying degrees of success in the year under review, and it is always difficult to compare two players who play in entirely different positions and leagues, but when comparisons are made about who has been the best at what he does, it has to be the Gabon hitman.\n\nView gallery .\n\nThe argument for Toure will be Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s triumph at the Africa Cup of Nations earlier in the year. That has been as much as he has done this year, which when put into proper perspective, isn\u2019t really jaw-dropping.\n\nOf course, leading your country to the Afcon title is huge for any national team captain, but was his individual contribution really that great?\n\nHe may have lifted only Cote d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s second Afcon trophy, but his on-field impact was minimal at best. One goal and one assist in a six-match tournament does not scream 'Africa\u2019s best'!\n\nOn top of that, he wasn\u2019t as influential for Manchester City as he had always been, as they finished second in the Premier League behind Chelsea. He also did little to prevent the Citizens prematurely exiting the League Cup and FA Cup.\n\nView gallery .\n\nHoodoo over...but is Yaya's star on the wane?\n\nBy contrast, Borussia Dortmund were rock-bottom of the Bundesliga table at the start of the year, and apparently seemed destined for relegation to the German second tier. Aubameyang\u2019s 11 goals in the New Year (16 for the season) saw them rise to seventh at the end of the campaign. He also scored five goals as Dortmund progressed to the final of the DFB Pokal, before losing to Wolfsburg in the final.\n\nAs much as winning the Afcon may be a factor, the overall importance of each individual player, and how much influence they have had for the underlined period must be taken into account.\n\nCongratulations to @YayaToure on being named African Player of the Year for a record 4th time in a row! #genius pic.twitter.com/e4jE1rLbOI \u2014 Nissan (@Nissan) January 9, 2015\n\nJohn Obi Mikel won the Afcon with Nigeria in 2013, albeit without being the most influential or important member of the triumphant Super Eagles side, and Toure was voted as Africa\u2019s best for that year as he was adjudged to have had a better year than the Nigerian, even though he didn\u2019t win any trophy for his club or country.\n\nIt is a similar case in 2015. Toure has won the Afcon, but he wasn\u2019t the star performer for Cote d\u2019Ivoire, and neither has he had as much influence for Manchester City.\n\nAubameyang, by contrast, won nothing, but he has scored 46 goals in 57 games for club and country this year. Those ridiculous stats clearly make him the most influential player of the three shortlisted candidates and, by some distance, the outstanding candidate for the 2015 African Player of the Year award.", "McIlroy projects Spieth will have trouble backing up two-major 2015": "Your browser does not support iframes.\n\nRory McIlroy thinks Jordan Spieth will have a tough time duplicating in 2016 anything resembling the season he enjoyed in 2015.\n\nThe Ulsterman is speaking from experience.\n\nMcIlroy closed 2014 with a stunning major double, winning his first British Open at Royal Liverpool, then taking his second PGA Championship in a squeaker over Phil Mickelson at Valhalla. This year, McIlroy notched four worldwide wins, including the WGC-Cadillac Match Play and the European Tour's DP World Tour Championship, but the four-time winner struck out in majors, influenced significantly by a July soccer injury that forced him to miss his Open title defense and come back rusty at the PGA Championship.\n\nEven if the 22-year-old Spieth is fully healthy throughout next year, McIlroy suggests history has not been kind to players who win multiple majors in a year.\n\n\u201cIt will feel completely different for Jordan,\u201d McIlroy said in an interview with The Telegraph in the U.K. \u201cIf you look at the stats at how those who have had a double-major season have performed the next year -- well, it\u2019s hard to back up. It just is. There\u2019s so much expectation, so much attention and focus. And I think it is more self-inflicted pressure really as your expectations are so high.\n\n\u201cThis time last year mine were through the roof coming off a great season, winning those back-to-back majors and although I started well I never felt I really got into my stride with the injuries and stuff.\u201d\n\nSpieth's 2015 is the 32nd time a player has won at least two majors in a season. Of the prior 31 times that's happened, only one player has gone on to win multiple majors the next season: Tiger Woods won the 2005 Masters and British Open, then, after his father's death in 2006, defending the Claret Jug at Royal Liverpool and won the PGA Championship.\n\nThat may sound daunting for Spieth, but there is some solace. Another 11 times a player has won multiple majors in a year, they've gone on to win another major the next year.\n\nRyan Ballengee is a Yahoo Sports contributor.

This week: Setting the bar after Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods", "It\u2019s either Trump or the Republican Party. Not both.": "(Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Andrew Harnik/AP, Ben Pruchnie/Getty Images, AP)\n\nThere\u2019s no hard and fast rule in politics to help you know when you\u2019ve crossed over from mere extremism into some dark borderland of reckless ignorance. Generally speaking, though, when you find yourself defending the wisdom of the Japanese-American internment, you probably left that boundary behind a few miles back.\n\nThat\u2019s the intellectual wasteland Donald Trump stumbled into this week when he issued what should hereafter be known as the Marvin Gaye Manifesto \u2014 his proposal that all Muslims be banned from entering the country until we can figure out \u201cwhat\u2019s going on.\u201d This immediately drew unusual condemnation from the new Republican speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader and the party\u2019s national chairman, along with the local Republican chairs in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nThe interesting question is what happens from here, because the way I see it, the cold war between Trump and the Republican governing establishment, which everyone hoped throughout the summer and fall might just resolve itself, has now become a zero-sum contest. And Republicans find themselves faced with an existential threat that has no parallel for either party in my lifetime.\n\nEither Trump or the Republican Party as we\u2019ve known it can come out of this election without having been politically destroyed \u2014 but almost certainly not both.\n\nBefore we climb into the time machine and survey the scenarios here, let me say that I still tend to think Trump won\u2019t be the Republican nominee. I realize the national and state polls say otherwise (CNN\u2019s latest survey shows him with a commanding lead in New Hampshire), and I acknowledge that one of the dangers in columnizing \u2014 at least when you have a healthy disdain for all the blather on cable TV and social media, as I do \u2014 is that you can sometimes dismiss conventional wisdom merely because it\u2019s conventional and not because it\u2019s wrong.\n\nHaving said that, though, most of the prophets who keep telling us that Trump is unstoppable are those who take a pretty grim view of Republican politics generally, and who are easily persuaded that the majority of conservative voters are unthinking and bigoted. Their predictions mostly reflect their own distrust of the electorate.\n\nIn fact, at this point in the race, as Stuart Stevens, the strategist behind Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, put it when we talked this week: \u201cYou, I and Donald Trump have all gotten the same amount of votes for president.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s support in the polls \u2014 which has generally hovered around 25 or 30 percent of the primary vote \u2014 may well be inelastic, meaning that nothing he says or does can shake it. But the window he once had in which to build on that support substantially has probably closed.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not so much that Trump\u2019s War on Islam will suddenly cause him to plummet in polls or lose any significant ground; it\u2019s that his ratings-driven rhetoric may well have trapped him exactly where he is, with nowhere to go but down.\n\nThis means Trump\u2019s success is entirely contingent on the rest of the field remaining chaotic and fractured, which seems unlikely to me. Already, polls show Ted Cruz rising fast in Iowa, and Marco Rubio and Chris Christie may be getting some separation in New Hampshire.\n\nRead More", "Arsenal 2-0 Bournemouth: Ozil gets Gunners back on track (Video)": "After an uninspired defeat to Southampton on Boxing Day, Arsenal got back on track with a solid performance against Bournemouth on Monday, leaving the Emirates with all three points after a 2-0 win.\n\nMesut Ozil put in another brilliant performance, grabbing a goal and an assist as the Gunners now sit top of the table, one point ahead of Leicester City. Leicester has one game in hand.\n\n[ RELATED: Watch full match replays ]\n\nAresene Wenger made four changes to his side that lost to Southampton, one key move being Gabriel coming into the defense for Laurent Koscielny.\n\nThose changes paid off, as Gabriel put Arsenal ahead in the 27th minute. Mesut Ozil\u2019s corner kick found the head of Gabriel, who took advantage of some poor defending from Bournemouth to walk past his mark and head home from close range.

Ozil weaved through a group of Cherries defenders, taking a clever flick from Giroud and slotting it through the keeper\u2019s legs to double the Arsenal lead.\n\nAfter the second goal, the Gunners saw the match out comfortably in a necessary win for the club.

The hard-hitting dos Anjos caught Cerrone just 15 or 20 seconds into the fight with a blistering straight left hand, signifying that not much would be different from their 2013 match.\n\nDos Anjos then caught Cerrone with a perfect knee to the midsection, that backed Cerrone toward the cage. Dos Anjos then pulled off the left kick to the body that badly hurt Cerrone. Cerrone covered up against the cage as dos Anjos poured it on in an effort to finish.\n\nCerrone, who entered the match on an eight-fight winning streak, managed to slip away from the cage, but he had no place to hide. Dos Anjos took him down seconds left and continued to throw hammer fists at Cerrone, who was on his knees covering his head.\n\nCerrone never moved to try to get away from the assault and referee Herb Dean jumped in to stop it.\n\nView photo . UFC lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos celebrates his victory over Donald Cerrone. (Photo by Josh Hedges/Getty \u2026\n\nLike so many other fights did on the card, dos Anjos then quickly took the opportunity to call out newly crowned featherweight champion Conor McGregor. After McGregor stopped long-time featherweight champion Jose Aldo a week earlier at UFC 191 in Las Vegas, he said he would be interested in facing the winner of the dos Anjos-Cerrone bout for the title.\n\nDos Anjos, who was a 2-1 favorite to defeat Cerrone, was eager to call out McGregor. McGregor is the big-money fight for so many, which is why former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar did a little media tour earlier in the week stating his case for a bout against McGregor for the featherweight belt.\n\nDos Anjos took his turn to call out the Irish star after his impressive win.\n\n\"Conor McGregor, if you want to come to the lightweight division, know that this is my division,\" he said. \"You should stay at featherweight. I will fight you in Brazil. I will go to Ireland to face you.\"\n\nCerrone, who had been among the hottest fighters in the sport, was bitterly disappointed. He is a notoriously slow starter and that plagued him again on Saturday.\n\nHe didn't land anything of consequence and took a beating in the process.\n\n\"It sucks,\" Cerrone said. \"I didn\u2019t show up to work. Couldn\u2019t find my gear. He showed up and I didn\u2019t. He did a good job.\"\n\nThe key now is if he did enough to impress McGregor to land the big-money bout.", "Kyrie Irving's late buzzer-beating 3 helps push Cavs past Suns": "In his first three games after returning from a fractured left kneecap, Kyrie Irving at times showed brief flashes of his All-Star form, but mostly \u2014 and quite understandably \u2014 looked like someone shaking the rust off after some 6 1/2 months on the shelf and trying to find his shooting and playmaking rhythm after missing the first 24 games of the new season. If his finish to the Cleveland Cavaliers' Monday visit to Arizona to take on the Phoenix Suns is any indication, Irving might be getting closer to being his old self again.\n\n[Follow Dunks Don't Lie on Tumblr: The best slams from all of basketball]\n\nAfter missing Cleveland's post-Christmas Day hangover loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Saturday, Irving returned to the Cavs' lineup on Monday \u2014 this time as a starter, a 2015-16 first \u2014 and came up huge in the clutch. He scored his team's final seven points, highlighted by a big shot-clock-buzzer-beating 3-pointer that gave Cleveland a four-point lead with 21.9 seconds left:\n\nIt'd be something of an understatement to suggest that Irving's triple is precisely what head coach David Blatt might have had in mind on the sideline, and Irving admitted as much after the game.\n\n\"Probably one of the ugliest possessions of my career right there,\" Irving told FOX Sports Ohio's Allie Clifton with a laugh. \"You know, it ended with a big 3, but we were trying to run 1-3 pick-and-roll, I pump-faked twice with the basketball, and then I throw it to [LeBron James] and then [J.R. Smith] miraculously comes up with it, and then Kevin [Love] pump-fakes and he throws it to me, and the shot clock ends ... and I'm just thankful, man. It was an ugly possession, but we got a score at the end, and we needed it.\"\n\nUgly though it may have been, the trip put Cleveland up 99-95 and gave them the inside track on a victory that looked just moments before like it might have gone up in smoke.\n\nA Cavalier lead that one stood at 11 was cut to a single point when Brandon Knight found the bottom of the net with a 3-pointer that made it 96-95 with 1:28 remaining in the fourth. After Irving and James both missed 3-point tries on the next Cavs possession, Phoenix came down with a chance to take the lead, and looked to have done just that on another Knight bomb ... only for the bucket to be waved off when the officials whistled center Tyson Chandler for a moving screen on Cavaliers swingman (and his former New York Knicks teammate) Iman Shumpert:\n\nChandler was beside himself at the call, insisting that Shumpert was the one who grabbed him to initiate the tangle on the high screen rather than the other way around. Suns coach Jeff Hornacek sounded a similar note after the game, though he incorrectly identified Cleveland guard Matthew Dellavedova (who, to be fair, does find himself in positions like these a lot) rather than Shumpert as the Cav who wrestled with Chandler:\n\nSuns coach Jeff Hornacek really didn't like the illegal screen call late on Tyson Chandler, nor is he a Delly fan pic.twitter.com/n00BXLfTCy \u2014 Jason Lloyd (@JasonLloydABJ) December 29, 2015\n\nWhether you think Shumpert got too tricky or Chandler got too handsy, the result of the play was a 96-95 Cleveland lead rather than a 98-96 Phoenix advantage. Twenty-four seconds later, Irving dialed long distance to put the Cavs up by two possessions, wholly changing the tenor of the final minute.\n\nKnight had a chance to get the Suns back within a bucket, but missed an open layup with 14 seconds left and a tip-in try three seconds later before booting P.J. Tucker's pass out of bounds, returning possession to Cleveland with 11 ticks remaining. He'd foul Irving on the inbounds and watch as Kyrie drained both freebies, giving him a team-high 22 points in just 24 minutes to lead Cleveland to a 101-97 win that halted a two-game Cavalier losing skid.\n\nSmith added 17 points on 5-for-11 shooting from 3-point range for the Cavs, who shot 17-for-41 from deep as a team en route to their seventh win in nine games. Love chipped in 16 points, seven rebounds and four assists in 25 minutes despite seeming to injure his right hand in the second half, while James added a somewhat quiet 14 points on 4-for-10 shooting with seven assists, four rebounds, two steals and a block.\n\nReserve forward T.J. Warren had 23 points with five boards in 27 1/2 minutes off the bench to lead the Suns, who are in the midst of a chaotic stretch that has seen disgruntled forward Markieff Morris suspended for two games after throwing a towel at coach Jeff Hornacek, star guard Eric Bledsoe lost to a torn meniscus, two of Hornacek's top assistants fired and an embarrassing loss to the previously 1-30 Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nStill, even with the walls seemingly closing in around him, Hornacek found positives in the team's fight to come back from an 11-point deficit to give itself a chance to win in the end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a loss but it\u2019s encouraging that we\u2019re without Eric, we\u2019re out there a lot of the time with Alex [Len] and Devin [Booker] and T.J., some of our young guys,\" he said after the game, according to Paul Coro of azcentral sports. \"That\u2019s a good effort. You can\u2019t fault that.\u201d\n\nKnight finished with 18 points on 7-for-18 shooting, while forwards P.J. Tucker and Jon Leuer each added 14 points and six rebounds for the Suns, who have now lost five straight to drop to 12-21.\n\nAfter doing his part to help the Cavs improve their East-leading record to 20-9, Irving is expected to sit out Cleveland's Tuesday meeting with the Denver Nuggets, as part of a better-safe-than-sorry \"no back-to-backs\" policy as he continues to work his way back from knee surgery. But with Cleveland's schedule lacking back-to-backs over the next few weeks, that could be the last time we see the Cavaliers jump tip without Irving in the backcourt for a while; or, at least, that's what Cavs fans thrilled to see Uncle Drew taking and making big late-game shots are hoping for, anyway.\n\nMore NBA coverage:\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nDan Devine is an editor for Ball Don't Lie on Yahoo Sports.

(AP) -- Sabres forward Evander Kane was calm and brief in saying he looks forward to having his name cleared in connection with a sex crime allegation.\n\n''I just want to say I've done nothing wrong,'' Kane said Monday morning following Buffalo's pre-game skate before hosting the Washington Capitals. ''I respect the legal process. And unfortunately at this time, there's not much more I can talk about.''\n\nKane spoke for about 30 seconds in front of a large gathering of reporters in a corner of the Sabres locker room. He did not take any questions in his first comments since The Buffalo News reported that Buffalo police were investigating a claim made against the player.\n\nThe alleged incident occurred early Sunday at a downtown hotel, where Kane is living, after he and the Sabres returned to Buffalo following a 6-3 win at Boston. Police issued a statement that was limited to saying that no report or charges had been filed.\n\nThe investigation is in its preliminary stages, according to a person with direct knowledge of the details who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because officials are not publicly commenting about the case. The person said police searched Kane's room at the hotel and towed his vehicle, describing that as standard practice in such cases.\n\nKane rejoined his teammates after being given a personal day off on Sunday, when coach Dan Bylsma said the Sabres were made aware of the allegation. Bylsma said Kane would be in the lineup against the Capitals.\n\nView gallery FILE - In this Dec. 26, 2015, file photo, Buffalo Sabres' Evander Kane (9) handles the puck behi \u2026\n\nWithout going into detail, Bylsma said Kane addressed the team before practice and added the player appeared happy to be on the ice with his teammates. Bylsma otherwise declined comment by referring to a statement the team released on Sunday.\n\n''We take the allegation made today against Evander Kane very seriously,'' the Sabres said. ''We are gathering facts and have been in touch with the NHL and Evander's representatives.''\n\nKane, who is from North Vancouver, British Columbia, is the second NHL player to be investigated for a sex offense by police in the Buffalo area this year. In November, prosecutors cited a lack of credible evidence after reviewing an allegation against Chicago Blackhawks star Patrick Kane, who was accused of assaulting a woman at his offseason home outside Buffalo in August.\n\nSabres captain Brian Gionta said the allegation against Kane shouldn't be a distraction.\n\n''It's one of our teammates obviously, but the bottom line is, when we're in this room we have to worry about hockey,'' Gionta said. ''Lots of things happen, and that's for him to deal with. Part of being a professional is trying to separate things.''\n\nView gallery FILE - In this Dec. 26, 2015, file photo, Buffalo Sabres' Evander Kane (9) celebrates his goal d \u2026\n\nGionta referred to the team statement when asked how the team will support Kane.\n\n''It's a serious accusation, but at the same time, that's what it is at this point in time,'' Gionta said. ''And until things change, he's our teammate and that's about it.''\n\nThe 24-year-old Kane is in his first full season in Buffalo after he was acquired in a multi-player trade with the Winnipeg Jets in February. He did not play for the Sabres last year because he was recovering from season-ending shoulder surgery.\n\nThis year, the hard-hitting forward has eight goals and five assists in 25 games.\n\nKane is in his seventh NHL season after being selected fourth overall by the then-Atlanta Thrashers in the 2009 draft. He has scored 19 or more goals three times, and enjoyed a career-best season in 2011-12, when he had 30 goals, 27 assists for 57 points in 74 games.", "Trump and the media, made for each other": "For many months now, like the anxious producers of some hot reality show, the American media has been waiting for Donald Trump to get up onstage and say the one thing that will lead to his swift and inevitable unraveling. (Waiting is not quite the same as hoping, but I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.)\n\nSometimes it seems that Trump himself is trying frantically to find that edge of acceptable rhetoric and hurl himself over it, maybe because this business of running for president is a lot more tedious and exhausting than, say, crowning Miss Universe.\n\nThis week, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard by now, Trump told an audience in Michigan that Hillary Clinton had been \u201cschlonged\u201d in 2008 (a variation on the Yiddish word for penis that he seems to have invented on the spot, but that is now assured to outlive the Yiddish language itself), and he made fun of Clinton\u2019s bizarre habit \u2014 \u201ctoo disgusting to talk about\u201d \u2014 of having to occasionally relieve herself in a bathroom.\n\nHe also clarified his difference with Vladimir Putin when it comes to these \u201clying, disgusting\u201d reporters who cover him. \u201cI hate some of these people, but I would never kill them,\u201d Trump volunteered. \u201cI would never kill them. But I do hate them.\u201d\n\nWell, that does it. If granting journalists a right to live doesn\u2019t puncture Trump\u2019s standing among conservative voters these days, then trust me, pretty much nothing will.\n\n(By the way, note that Trump didn\u2019t actually go so far as to condemn such violence, or even discourage it. He just declined to kill anyone himself. The man is busy.)\n\nIt\u2019s time for me to admit I was wrong about Trump\u2019s staying power. And it\u2019s time for the rest of my industry to take a long look in the mirror and consider what we\u2019ve wrought.\n\nBecause it\u2019s clear now that Trump\u2019s enduring popularity \u2014 his relentless assault on the weathered pillars of our public civility \u2014 is in no small part a reflection of an acid disdain for us.\n\nTrump has always understood this. Look at the graphic terms in which he once attacked Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly. Or the way he viciously mocked Serge Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter who excels despite a physical disability. Or how he publicly berated Katy Tur, an NBC reporter, for sport.\n\nPlaying off the media isn\u2019t novel, of course. When George H.W. Bush ran for reelection back in 1992, somebody \u2014 maybe it was his campaign, since in those days there weren\u2019t any super-PACS \u2014 made a bumper sticker that read \u201cAnnoy the media. Re-elect Bush.\u201d\n\nFor many years after Bush lost, you could still see those bumper stickers on any highway in America. It had little to do with the candidate.\n\nBut that was a statement on liberalism and elitism, a kind of cultural homogeneity inside the nation\u2019s largest media institutions. It was almost respectful. Bush would never have used the word \u201chate,\u201d and neither would the people with the bumper stickers.\n\nThis is something more visceral, an emotion that\u2019s been building in all segments of the electorate, to some extent, for decades.\n\nThis is a simmering reaction to smugness and shallowness in the media, a parade of glib punditry unmoored to any sense of history or personal experience. It\u2019s about our love of gaffes and scandals, real or imagined, and our rigid enforcement of the politically correct.\n\nRead More", "2015 Reviews: Michael Waltrip Racing": "View photo . Michael Waltrip Racing.\n\n\n\nDrivers (standings in parenthesis): Clint Bowyer (16th), David Ragan (27th), Brett Moffitt (34th), Michael Waltrip (43rd), Brian Vickers (45th)\n\nHighlights: Bowyer made the Chase despite not winning a race. Bowyer had 12 top-10 finishes in 2015 and used a strong summer run to power into the Chase. Bowyer was sixth at Indianapolis, eighth at Pocono, sixth at Watkins Glen and fifth at Bristol. The four finishes surrounded a 41st at Michigan and solidified Bowyer in the top 15 of the Sprint Cup points standings. He also finished third at Sonoma in June.\n\nMoffitt, filling in for Vickers at Atlanta, finished seventh. And that's really about it for the No. 55 car, which was driven by Waltrip, Moffitt, Vickers and Ragan. Moffitt was the only driver in the No. 55 who got a top 10 in 2015.\n\nLowlights: Well, uh, do we want to lead with the big news or get to that in a moment? OK, we'll lead with it. Rob Kauffman, Waltrip's business partner at MWR and the financial backer for the team, left to partner with Chip Ganassi. Without Kauffman's money, Michael Waltrip Racing said it wouldn't run full time in 2016, leaving Bowyer and Ragan to look for new rides.\n\nVickers was sidelined for the season after two races because of a reccurrence of blood clots and Ragan took his place after filling in for Kyle Busch at Joe Gibbs Racing. Ragan didn't show much speed in his MWR tenure.\n\nSure, Bowyer was in the Chase, but it was a symbolic Chase berth. He was penalized 25 points for an inspection infraction at Chicago and ended up 16th in the points standings. Yes, even behind Matt Kenseth, who was suspended by NASCAR for two races. And yes, he would have finished behind Kenseth even without the penalty. That's how bad Bowyer's Chase was.\n\nOverview: Waltrip isn't going anywhere. He's still got his analyst role at Fox Sports and sponsorship from Maxwell House. He said in October he was planning to attempt the Daytona 500, though it's unclear how he would do so. He could run the team himself or team with another Toyota team to run the race.\n\nIf he chooses the latter option, he's looking at an alliance with either Joe Gibbs Racing or Furniture Row, who has an alliance with JGR. They're the two factory-backed Toyota teams left now that MWR ceases to exist full time.\n\nBowyer is going to spend a year in Kahnegatory in 2016 with HScott Motorsports before moving to the No. 14 car at Stewart-Haas Racing to replace Tony Stewart. He likened the deal to falling in a pile of cow manure and smelling like roses. We're inclined to agree.\n\nRagan's future is unclear. There aren't any competitive Cup Series rides open for 2016. Is he better served going to win races in the Xfinity or Truck Series if possible rather than hanging on at NASCAR's top level?\n\nPrevious Reviews: Richard Petty Motorsports, Roush Fenway Racing, JTG-Daugherty Racing and Germain Racing, HScott Motorsports, Front Row Motorsports, BK Racing and Tommy Baldwin Racing.\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nNick Bromberg is the editor of From The Marbles on Yahoo Sports.

General manager Ryan McDonough had said only that he hoped Bledsoe would return at some point this season.\n\nThat all changed with Tuesday's surgery.\n\n''I've had a meniscus done,'' Hornacek said Tuesday. ''They can either repair it or cut it out. Repairing is probably the best thing to happen. You're out longer but it's the best thing for your joint and knee.''\n\nBledsoe appeared in 31 games this season, averaging 20.4 points and 6.1 assists per game. He has averaged 17.9 points in 155 games in parts of three seasons with the Suns since coming in a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nIt is the third significant knee injury in Bledsoe's six-year NBA career. He underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee in 2011 and had the right meniscus removed in January 2014.\n\nWhile Bledsoe missed 2 1/2 months of play after his 2014 surgery, he returned to appear in 81 games last season, averaging 17 points, 6.1 assists and 5.2 rebounds per game.\n\nBledsoe signed a five-year, $70 million contract just before the start of last season.\n\nHe teamed with Goran Dragic in a double point-guard system in the 2013-14 season, when the Suns won 48 games and narrowly missed the playoffs. McDonough brought in a third point guard, Isaiah Thomas, before last season and the glut of playmakers failed to work as hoped. Dragic and Thomas were traded away at the trade deadline. But the deals brought another point guard, Brandon Knight, to Phoenix.\n\nThis season, Bledsoe and Knight had teamed in the double-point guard approach.\n\nThe injury means the team will return to a more conventional system with a point guard and an off guard. Rookie Devin Booker started at the off guard position in Phoenix's loss to Cleveland on Monday night.\n\n''It could be good for us in the long run,'' Hornacek said. ''It will give some of these guys more opportunity to play and get better, some of our young guys and that will be good for them.''\n\nThe bad news on Bledsoe's injury came with the Suns mired in a five-game losing streak. Phoenix has lost 16 of 21 games going into Wednesday night's contest at San Antonio.\n\nIn a shake-up of Hornacek's staff, the team fired assistant coaches Mike Longabardi and Jerry Sichting on Monday.", "Predators-Blues Preview": "The St. Louis Blues have used Jake Allen and some strong work on the power play to beat the Nashville Predators twice this season.\n\nThey figure to try to employ that formula once again Tuesday night as they seek their first four-game home win streak of the season.\n\nAllen is 6-2-0 with a 1.62 goals-against average in his last eight starts and has yielded one goal in two against the Predators this season to improve to 3-0-0 as a starter against them.\n\nSt. Louis (22-12-4) features one of the league's best power plays at 20.9 percent and that unit has gone 3 for 5 in the season series. Vladimir Tarasenko, Colton Parayko and Alex Pietrangelo all tallied with the man advantage.\n\nThe Blues tested themselves against one of the league's elite teams in a home-and-home set against Dallas over the weekend. They won 3-2 in a shootout at home Saturday before falling 3-0 the next night.\n\n\"(Saturday) I think we got what we deserved, we played really well, it was good we were able to get two points,\" defenseman Jay Bouwmeester said. \"(Sunday) we knew it was going to be a struggle for both teams and they just came out for whatever reason and got off to a better start and we didn't really respond the way we needed to.\"\n\nTarasenko had an eight-game streak in which he amassed 12 points snapped Sunday. He has seven points in a five-game run at home versus Nashville.\n\nAllen made 22 saves to earn Saturday's win before Brian Elliott stopped 35 of 37 shots the next night when the Blues' No. 1 goalie rested.\n\n\"The part that disappoints everybody here,\" coach Ken Hitchcock said, \"is (Elliott) battled like crazy, he made great saves, he kept us right there and we couldn't get a goal for him.\"\n\nNashville (18-12-6) completed a 3-1-0 homestand with Monday's 5-3 victory over the New York Rangers. Mike Ribeiro had one goal and seven assists in the four games, with three assists Monday.\n\n\"We're a team that responds pretty well against good teams so it's a matter of being focused every night,\" Ribeiro said.\n\nJames Neal scored twice and Filip Forsberg added a power-play goal to give him six points in a five-game run. Nashville converted both power-play chances and went 4 for 13 on the homestand.\n\n\"When our power play is scoring, it's usually a difference,\" center Mike Fisher said.\n\nThe Predators welcomed back Fisher from an 11-game absence due to a lower-body injury.\n\n\"Mike looked really good,\" coach Peter Laviolette said. \"It's nice to have him back in there. He really provides a steadiness to our lineup.\"\n\nPekka Rinne made 26 saves. He has started both ends of a back-to-back once so Carter Hutton may get the nod Tuesday.\n\nThe Predators are beginning a three-game trip that include visits to Dallas and Carolina.\n\n\"We've got a tough three games coming up, two especially in our division that are huge,\" Fisher said.\"We've gotta get back at it tomorrow.\"", "Good news, everyone: Hawks PG Jeff Teague is a wine glass now": "You've spent this whole holiday season giving everyone else gifts; why not treat yourself to the present everyone really wants?

In other words, tens of millions of you.\n\nSo why is this happening? Why is college football staging its semifinals at a time that everyone predicts will cause fewer people to watch?\n\nHere\u2019s the honest answer: the people who run college football don\u2019t care about you. At all. Like, not one single bit.\n\nIt may not make sense, but that\u2019s the answer. View gallery . Fans of Nick Saban's Alabama (L) and Mark Dantonio's MSU may have to stay at home on New Year's Eve. (AP)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re establishing a new tradition,\u201d playoff executive director Bill Hancock said. \u201cWe're going to change the paradigm of New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d\n\nExcept, no one is trying to establish a new tradition here. They are honoring two of the oldest traditions in America \u2026 self-indulgence and cronyism.\n\nThe conference commissioners who run the sport may not care about or even consider you, the fan, but they do care deeply about bowl executives, usually old friends who have been plying them with free everything \u2013 golf, gifts, booze, hotels, Caribbean cruises, you name it \u2013 for decades.\n\nThey really, really love those guys. Love them so much that when they designed the playoff they made sure, out of the goodness of their hearts, to continue outsourcing their most profitable games to them.\n\nThey love all bowl games but they love none quite like the Rose Bowl.\n\nAs such, they would never dare make the Rose Bowl move its kickoff time from 5 p.m. ET on Jan. 1 \u2013 you know, that perfect time to watch a big game. That\u2019s when the start of the semifinal doubleheader should always be played. One out of every three years, when the Rose Bowl is a host, it is.\n\nYet in the other two years the Rose Bowl still gets the best time slot even if the game, such as this year, can only be considered \u201cbig\u201d if you\u2019re from Iowa. Meanwhile, the Sugar Bowl has somehow been granted exclusivity to the equally coveted primetime slot on New Year\u2019s Day, even if it\u2019s hosting Ole Miss-Oklahoma State and the five losses between them.\n\nOklahoma-Clemson and Michigan State-Alabama, the games that actually matter, get the less desirable times the day before.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nAgain, this makes no sense. It\u2019s the reality though. In college football the Rose Bowl gets to call the shots. It just does. In any other sport, or any other business, executives would either tell them to move or just crush them with counter programming.\n\nInstead, college football decision-makers tell the fans to get lost while gleefully allowing the bowls to lead them around by the nose.\n\nConference commissioners are like that desperate guy in every Cialis commercial, blithely going for boring hikes through the foliage or freezing while holding hands in his and her tubs overlooking a valley (\"You want me to take a bath in the damn woods?\"). It\u2019s all in the pitiful hope that their favorite bowl executive will give them that look that says the time is right. View gallery . CFP director Bill Hancock doesn't seem to care about your New Year's Eve plans. (AP)\n\nOh Rose Bowl, of course I\u2019ll kick off a semifinal at 1 p.m. on a workday on the West Coast. And yes, I\u2019ll absolutely not care about people, mostly younger, who have long-established plans or work that evening \u2013 in restaurants or transportation or staffed-up hospitals or wherever. I know you're not a school, a conference or in any way part of the NCAA, but let's go have a long, meaningful talk over a hot cup of tea.\n\nThe other option would be to just grant the Rose and Sugar Bowl permanent semifinal hosting status, maintaining New Year\u2019s Day as the day for the semifinals. That would be true love, but it would also prevent spreading the graft out to four other bowl sites.\n\nExtra palms. Extra grease.\n\nDon\u2019t blame ESPN. It knows its ratings will drop. The network fought this originally \u2013 literally stunned it was even a consideration. Later it lobbied to move, for this year only, the semifinals to Saturday, Jan. 2.\n\nThe NFL is staging all its Week 17 games on Sunday, Jan. 3, so Saturday is wide open. It's absolutely perfect if you care about, say, trying to make it as convenient as possible for fans to either watch on TV or travel to a game.\n\n\"We understand and appreciate their interest in this,\" Hancock said in a statement last January. \u201cThe fact is that we have started a new tradition \u2026 we're not interested in changing.\u201d\n\nDon't worry, Saturday night they'll give you the Motel 6 Cactus Bowl instead. So there's that.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nLook, these guys aren\u2019t really in tune with anything but the hardest core segment of their fan base \u2013 the fanatical booster that will find a way. And, yes, many people will still watch. I'm one of them. It\u2019s easy for me to be there though because this is my job. Most really big-time fans will find time too. Some others will \u2013 those who usually stay in on New Year\u2019s Eve (then again, if you stay in on New Year\u2019s Eve, you also stay in on New Year\u2019s Day too).\n\nMany won\u2019t though and that\u2019s rough for them. Some will try and fail to carve out eight hours of football viewing under relationship duress. Some will be stuck at nightclubs or weddings or a couples' function. Others just have to earn an honest living. These people are a mystery to the commissioners, whose work entails watching college football and therefore seem to assume everyone can watch while on the job. Look, Mr. Police Officer, just stream it on your tablet. Those drunk drivers can handle themselves.\n\nAs for entertainment options, for these guys, New Year\u2019s Eve has long been about whatever bowl director is springing for the single malts and medium rares. Conceptually, a party is being at some other old person\u2019s house where the TV can easily show the game, especially since they can\u2019t seem to figure out what channel Dick Clark is on anyway.\n\n\u201cIt might be a great way to bring more women to college football,\u201d Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany reasoned to the Chicago Tribune. \u201cWe can build our audience.\u201d View gallery .\n\nOK, then. Delany is the same guy who runs a Midwest-based league but didn\u2019t want any semifinals played in the Midwest because he has too much love for the old bowls and old bowl directors in the South and West. Forget seeking a competitive advantage for his teams or bringing big-event revenue to the region or caring about how costly the travel is for his own league\u2019s fans.\n\nReally, this is your fault. You should have planned accordingly. They warned you by running that commercial with Jimmy Kimmel and a host of characters sadly singing \"Auld Lang Syne\" at a New Year\u2019s Eve party.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird spot and not just because, as SB Nation pointed out, the UCLA mascot, Joe Bruin, tries to pick up a blonde party-goer while also having his arm wrapped around his steady, Josephine Bruin (now this is an adventurous way to ring in 2016).\n\nStranger is there are no TVs at the party in the commercial. In an effort to get you to watch the College Football Playoff on New Year's Eve, no one is watching the College Football Playoff on New Year's Eve.\n\nApparently Jimmy Kimmel has other things to do, too.\n\nPopular college football video on Yahoo Sports:\n\n", "Former intern at center of the Peyton Manning-HGH scandal explains why he made it all up": "Peyton Manning found himself embroiled in scandal when an Al Jazeera documentary linked the Denver Broncos quarterback to shipments of human growth hormone (HGH).\n\nManning vehemently denied that he has ever used HGH and the source for that story, a former intern at an anti-aging clinic in Indianapolis, has since recanted the statements he made in a secretly recorded conversation with an undercover reporter.\n\nThat intern, Charles Sly, also spoke with Chris Mortensen of ESPN to explain why he made the entire story up.\n\nFirst of all, Sly reiterated to Mortensen that he manufactured the entire story and confirmed that he was only employed at the clinic in 2013, two years after Manning was a patient.\n\nAs to why Sly made up the allegations about Manning and other athletes, this is where it gets confusing. It starts with the undercover reporter used by Al Jazeera, Liam Collins.\n\nCollins, a former hurdler for Great Britain, spoke with Sly, and others, under the guise of an older athlete (he is 38) looking for something to help him reclaim his top form. According Mortensen, Sly was looking to get into the athlete supplement business and, through some mutual contacts, met with Collins believing he could help Sly contact top soccer players in the English Premier League.\n\n\u201c[Sly] wanted to get into the supplementation business and [Collins] had told [Sly] that there were a lot of prominent Premier League athletes, soccer players, that he could bring business to Sly and some other people he was working with,\u201d Mortensen said on ESPN Radio.\n\nHowever, prior to going undercover for Al Jazeera \u2014 and after a stint as a dancer on \u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent\" \u2014 Collins was caught in a scandal of his own in which he was accused of duping investors out of more than $1 million in a real estate scheme.\n\nThis may have led to Sly not trusting Collins as a potential business associate.\n\n\u201cHe really attacked Liam Collins, who was the guy who secretly taped him,\u201d Mortensen continued. \u201cI asked, \u2018Well, why would you do that?\u2019 He said, 'I was trying to test him and press him, see if he would steal my information, because that is what he did with his investors over in Great Britain\u2019\n\n\"He said he wanted to throw out different names, and whether they were treated at the Guyer Institute,\u201d Mortensen continued. \u201cHe said he was trying to use different names to test this guy\u2019s knowledge, Liam Collins\u2019 knowledge, on players. and he tried to change up each story with each guy just to see if this guy would try to gather any more information.\u201d\n\nAs for why he used Manning\u2019s name even though he was no longer a patient at the clinic at the time Sly was employed there, Sly says he simply learned that Manning had been a patient there through other employees.\n\n\u201cI said, 'How did you come up with this story of Peyton and Ashley Manning?,\u2019\u201d Mortensen said. \u201cAnd he said, 'Well, when I was working there for those three months, somebody said that they used to be patients there.\u2019\u201d\n\nSly also says he never saw any documentation to support what he had said about Manning.\n\nSly\u2019s story still doesn\u2019t clear up the picture completely, with Mortensen saying that despite emails, phone conversations, and forwarded text messages, he \u201cstill can\u2019t put that puzzle together.\u201d\n\nHowever, it sounds like Sly wanted to get into the athlete supplement business. He thought he had one potential client in Collins, and that this one athlete might be able to hook Sly up with some big-name soccer players. Sly then may have thrown out the names of big American athletes to either up his street cred or to test Collins (or maybe both). Sly may have used the names of athletes known to have been clients at the Guyer Clinic in case Collins tried to verify the stories, only instead of taking the info to soccer players in England, Collins took the secret tape recordings to Al Jazeera.\n\nIf this is indeed how the situation played out, it sounds like Peyton and his wife got caught in the middle simply because one overzealous former employee either oversold his own accomplishments in the business or just didn\u2019t trust a potential business associate who has a checkered financial history.\n\nAnd if so, it is easy to understand why Manning is so upset.\n\nNOW WATCH: LeBron James just signed the biggest endorsement deal in Nike history", "Murray calls out Ducks; Marchand's rise; Wilson rips TSN (Puck Headlines)": "Here are your Puck Headlines: A glorious collection of news and views collected from the greatest blogosphere in sports and the few, the proud, the mainstream hockey media.

My cash pile has been about 30-40% over the past 2 years and I\u2019ve been adding to my core positions lately too. But even with a sizable cash amount, it\u2019s been more than enough to beat the market and achieve returns I\u2019ve been satisfied with.\n\nWarren Buffett says that he maintains a $20B cash pile no matter what.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new to investing in stocks or not, or you know somebody who wants to start investing, there are a ton of excuses that hold people back.\n\nMaybe this is you.\n\nOr maybe you know someone like that.\n\nBut with the new year approaching fast, here are the top ten excuses people make and how to overcome them.\n\n#10. I Don\u2019t Know Anything About Investing\n\nThe classic scapegoat answer you hear all the time.\n\nActually, it was my answer for many years.\n\nI knew nothing about any kind of investing, let alone picking stocks.\n\nAll I had was a 401k and the desire to make my own investment decisions.\n\nI had already experienced my first 100% loss due to a bad financial advisor, so I decided I would learn how to do it myself.\n\nThe good thing about knowing nothing is that you don\u2019t have any preconceived notions about how all this works. Before all this, I had never taken a finance, business, accounting or economics class so everything was brand new.\n\nBut knowing nothing helped because it helped to approach it with fresh eyes and an open mind, which is exactly what you\u2019ve got.\n\nThankfully I found the path of value investing.\n\n#9. I Don\u2019t Have a Lot of Money to Play With\n\nStarting small helps.\n\nYou are less afraid and it\u2019s just easier to manage.\n\nAfter all, if you are afraid of losing $200, how on earth will you handle paper losses of $20,000 if you have a million dollar or bigger portfolio in the future.\n\nI started investing with just $3,000. That was big to me back then.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have that much, take a year to save it and then start investing. If you can find several things to trim out of your budget that add up to $250 per month, you\u2019ll be right on track to have $3,000 in savings at the end of year to begin your investing journey.\n\nAnd yes, the hard truth is that you have to learn to live beneath your means in order to save money that you can then invest and grow.\n\n#8. I Don\u2019t Know What Stocks to Buy\n\nIt\u2019s all about a routine.\n\nIf you exercise or go to the gym, you\u2019ll know what I mean. Instead of just showing up at the gym and mindlessly going from one workout equipment to another, if you have a specific goal and routine in mind, you\u2019ll be more effective and see results.\n\nThis is a call to action to come up with a game plan.\n\nThe most basic idea and easiest to get started with when picking stocks in the value investing approach is this: Buy undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals.\n\nSo start with this big idea and then work backwards by asking and researching questions like:\n\nwhat makes a stock undervalued?\n\nwhat is considered undervalued?\n\nwhat are the conditions for strong and weak fundamentals?\n\nwhat price should I buy to ensure safety of principle?\n\nWhen you get to the point where you know what to look for and you have a routine or process of looking at stocks, get stocks ideas from these:\n\n#7. I\u2019m Not as Confident as Most Investors\n\nIn other words, inferiority complex \u2013 which should have nothing to do with investing and your money.\n\nBut it\u2019s a good quality to have, because then you won\u2019t fall prey to being over-confident or arrogant.\n\nBeing over-confident when making investments in the stock market eventually leads to disaster every single time. On the other hand, you mustn\u2019t let fear keep you on the sidelines.\n\nKeep this in mind: If you follow a solid value investment approach like what I advocate here on OSV, that should boost your confidence because you know you\u2019re focused on picking undervalued companies with great fundamentals.\n\n#6. I\u2019m Too Old to Take Advantage of Long-Term Value Investing\n\nYes, the younger you start the better, but how does that make people in their forties and fifties feel?\n\nIt makes them feel like it\u2019s too late, and that\u2019s simply not true because it\u2019s never too late to start investing.\n\nEven if you start at 60 and live to 88, that\u2019s 28 years of investing that will your family or any other cause you support.\n\nWarren Buffett is 85 years young.\n\nCharlie Munger is 91 years young.\n\nWalter Schloss passed at 95 investing to the end.\n\nSo to did Irving Kahn who passed at 109 years of age.\n\nInvesting makes your mind sharper and younger and is never too late.\n\n#5. I Don\u2019t Know What Strategy to Use\n\nThis is a legitimate problem because there are so many ways to invest.\n\nThe best way is to stick with one strategy at first and expand as your experience and skills grow.\n\nHere are a few approaches you can research and dig further into:\n\nNet net strategy of buying stocks dirt cheap stocks that come with a ton of baggage\n\nCompanies with no debt\n\nCompanies where the growth in FCF is faster than earnings growth\n\nStocks with strong brands that offer rock solid dividends\n\nAnother approach is to simply weed out any stock you come across with poor cash flow, too much debt, bad earnings, negligible anticipated growth and inconsistent numbers.\n\n#4. I Don\u2019t Know When to Sell a Stock\n\nA core idea of value investing is to limit the number of transactions.\n\nBut, there are reasons to unload a stock:\n\nyou realize you made a mistake in valuing the company\n\nthe company\u2019s fundamentals have changed\n\na better value opportunity is available\n\nyou have a cash emergency\n\nthe stock has risen too far above its intrinsic value\n\nAny time you buy a stock, you should also outline for yourself what your exit strategy will be, and stick to it.\n\nHere are tips from the gurus on when to sell.\n\nHere\u2019s a more behavioral look of selling stocks that I recommend.\n\n#3. I Can\u2019t Handle the Stock Market\u2019s Volatility\n\nYes, the stock market is volatile.\n\nThe stock market is also only volatile if you constantly check stock prices.\n\nIf home prices were published every second, would you move out every time it dipped?\n\nWarren Buffett has always been bullish on the US economy which is a huge vote of confidence on what he thinks about the long term future.\n\nGuessing what will happen next week or month is a fool\u2019s game.\n\nOver the long-term the stock market has always done one thing and one thing only \u2013 RISE.\n\nAny given shorter period of time might see a crash or a decline, but the market always recovers and then goes on to new highs.\n\nThe Old School Value approach to investing is to keep the long term firmly in mind.\n\nKeeping things to a long term perspective drowns out the noise and the people who are more interested with taking the money from your pocket.\n\n#2. There\u2019s Too Much Investment Information\n\nInformation overload is a real problem.\n\nBut the secret is that you don\u2019t need to digest all of it.\n\nFind sources of information you feel confident about and can trust.\n\nHere\u2019s my list of 60 valuable value investing resources.\n\n#1. Understanding the Financials and Accounting is Too Hard\n\nI had never taken any kind of finance, accounting, or economics course in my life. You don\u2019t need any of that (although it\u2019s not a bad idea).\n\nAll you need is the desire to learn, and no excuses.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be an expert, but you do need to know the basics and get to be proficient.\n\nIf a 17 year old can learn basic accounting in school, why can\u2019t you?\n\nIf you can do plus and minus, you\u2019ve got the skillset required.\n\nStart with this tutorial of how Warren Buffett analyzes the financial statements.\n\nSumming Up\n\nHow many of these excuses have you heard yourself or others using when it comes to investing?\n\nNone of them should hold you back from putting your hard-earned dollars to work for you in the stock market, especially if you\u2019re committed to taking the value investing approach outlined here on OSV.\n\nWhen investors start using the excuses I\u2019ve outlined here, they often wind up doing something they think is \u201csafer\u201d with their investment money, such as putting it into bonds, mutual funds or under the mattress.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I want to put my investment money to work for me in the one place that history has shown will continue to do well for decades to come, and that is the stock market.\n\nStop making excuses.\n\nDive into the value investing journey to create a brighter financial future for you and your loved ones. When you look back years from now, you\u2019ll scratch your head and wonder why you waited so long.\n\nGet our free daily or weekly newsletter , follow us on Twitter, Tumblr, like us on Facebook, connect with us on Linkedin", "3 reasons why Intel pulled the trigger on a massive $16.7 billion deal, its biggest ever": "On Monday, Intel finally closed the $16.7 billion deal to buy programmable chipmaker Altera. The deal was first announced in May but it took more than 6 months to complete the process.\n\nAnytime a company spends this much on a single deal \u2014 it's Intel's largest acquisition ever \u2014 it creates a lot of chatter around why it did so.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see exactly how the two companies benefit each other, but Intel CEO Brian Krzanich pointed to three main reasons for the acquisition at a recent Credit Suisse conference:\n\n1) Moore's Law can improve Altera's FPGA manufacturing process: Intel's chipmaking process has been predicated on something called Moore's Law, a \"law\" that stipulates the chip size will shrink while doubling computing power every two to two and a half years. Altera's FPGA chips are a special type of chip that can reconfigure its functionality after purchase, and Intel's advanced manufacturing process can help it bring to market faster.\n\n\"We believe we can add to their architectural capabilities and their Moore\u2019s Law capabilities to grow the base business at a faster rate,\" Krzanich said.\n\n2) It speeds up the data center performance: Intel is betting on its data center chips to drive future growth, and Altera's FPGA chips have become increasingly popular among companies that run large data centers. Krzanich plans to combine FPGA chips with its traditional processors to bring much better performance.\n\nIn fact, Wendell Brooks, Intel's VP of mergers and acquisitions, told the WSJ that packaging FPGA and Intel's Xeon chips together could improve performance by up to 50%, while integrating the two technologies into a single product could double or triple the performance.\n\n3) It takes Intel beyond the core PC business: Intel historically generated most of its sales by selling chips for PCs, but with a shrinking PC market, it's been looking for other industries to drive growth. One of them is the market for Internet of Things, in which Intel provides chips that power devices that connect to each other. Krzanich cited things like driverless cars as possible areas it could further get into.\n\nKrzanich said adding the FPGA technology will \"drive performance, power and cost reductions as a result,\" and take Intel into \"multiple sectors.\"\n\nThe market seems to be in favor of the Altera move, too. Intel shares are up 1.5% as of Tuesday morning, hovering at around $35.44 per share. Deutsche Bank's Ross Seymore gave a buy rating and raised the price target to $38 per share.\n\n\"We estimate Altera to contribute $1.76 billion revenue to Intel\u2019s Data Center Group segment in 2016 in-line with our current revenue estimate for Altera,\" Seymore wrote. \"We now estimate Intel\u2019s Data Center Group revenues to grow +21% year-over-year, up from +10% year-over-year previously as Altera accounts for ~53% of year-over-year Data Center Group revenue growth.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: This global candy favorite is still illegal in the US \u2014 here\u2019s what's inside", "The most endangered jobs of 2016": "The economy should muddle forward in 2016, with employers likely to match or exceed the 2.6 million jobs created during the last 12 months. But the mix of jobs will continue to shift, for one big reason we\u2019re all very familiar with by now: the digital revolution.\n\nMcKinsey & Co. estimated recently that 45% of all activities humans perform in the workplace can be done by software or machines that already exist. That portion will most likely rise in the future. And it\u2019s no longer just rote mechanical jobs that are vulnerable to automation. Even CEOs spend their time doing work that can be automated, according to McKinsey.\n\nIn many industries, robots may end up working alongside humans rather than replacing them completely. But workers in some industries seem especially vulnerable to technology. These are 5 categories of jobs, for instance, in which McKinsey estimates that somewhere between 85% and 100% of the labor can be done by machines rather than humans:\n\nProduction workers in industries such as textiles, packaging, coating, painting and meatcutting. Approximate number of such workers: 3.2 million. These are mostly lower-skill jobs that can be done by increasingly sophisticated machines\u2014a trend that has been underway for years and shows no signs of abating.\n\nBookkeeping, accounting, auditing and billing clerks. Number of workers: 2.1 million. Software can now help individuals and small businesses track their bills, invoices, expenses and taxes, replacing the clerical staff who do much of this basic work. There's still strong demand for more sophisticated auditors and accountants who deal with complex tax and financial situations.\n\nMechanics and automotive technicians. Number of workers: 740,000. Vehicles are loaded with software these days, and fixing problems often requires digital updates rather than mechanical fixes. As more vehicles become connected to the Internet, software updates will be beamed straight to the vehicle, with no visit to the dealership required.\n\nConstruction equipment operators. Number of workers: 340,000. Increasingly efficient machines get more accomplished with fewer people\u2014plus, robotic dozers and graders are on the way.\n\nBakers and butchers. Number of workers: 300,000. These might seem like hands-on jobs, but machinery now requires little but professional oversight.\n\nMany of the jobs lost in these and other fields will be offset by newly created jobs, many of them relating to the digital technology that\u2019s transforming the workplace. But some jobs that have been around for a while still seem safe. Here are 5 categories of jobs in which little or none of the work can be automated, according to McKinsey.\n\nFreight, stock and material movers. Number of workers: 2.3 million. A lot of transportation work can be done by conveyor belts and other machines, but moving stuff around still requires a lot of people to maintain cargo facilities, handle pop-up problems, maintain equipment and supervise it all.\n\nHome health aide. Number of workers: 800,000. The job requires a personal touch and the ability to respond to a patient\u2019s needs.\n\nManagement analyst. Number of workers: 570,000. These professionals make strategic decisions based on data, financial performance and company priorities.\n\nSales managers. Number of workers: 375,000. It still takes a human touch to oversee the people who bring in revenue and generate new business.\n\nClergy. Number of workers: 45,000. A robotic minister? Don\u2019t think so.\n\nRick Newman\u2019s latest book is Liberty for All: A Manifesto for Reclaiming Financial and Political Freedom. Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.", "Rory McIlroy explains why Jordan Spieth could struggle this season": "Jordan Spieth set the golf world ablaze last year when he won back-to-back majors, the Masters and the U.S. Open, as a 21-year-old with just one previous PGA Tour victory to his name.\n\nFrom there Spieth went on to finish in the top-five at the two remaining majors (T-4 at the British Open and second at the PGA Championship), and he won the FedEx Cup.\n\nBy season's end, Spieth was world number one and had become, unequivocally, The Future of Golf.\n\nAs the upcoming golf season slowly kicks into gear, one of the most enticing subplots will be if Spieth can pick up where he left off.\n\nAccording to Rory McIlroy, who knows a thing or two about early-career success, it's going to be awfully difficult for Spieth to do so.\n\n\"It will feel completely different for Jordan,\" McIlroy told the Telegraph on Monday. \"If you look at the stats at how those who have had a double-major season have performed the next year \u2026 well, it\u2019s hard to back up. It just is. There\u2019s so much expectation, so much attention and focus. And I think it is more self-inflicted pressure really as your expectations are so high.\"\n\nAt first glance, McIlroy's comments feel sort of obvious: it's always harder to win when the spotlight is on you, which is why we so rarely see repeat victories in sports. But McIlroy is also speaking from experience as someone who has struggled after seasons in which he's won majors, and as someone who knows what it's like to be anointed golf's bright future.\n\nIn 2012, a 22-year-old McIlroy became the second youngest golfer to ever become the world number one, and later that season he won the 2012 PGA Championship, the second major championship of his career. In 2013, however, he struggled to live up to expectations, winning one tournament but making little noise at the majors.\n\nMcIlroy bounced back in 2014 to win two more majors, the British Open and the PGA Championship. This gave him four major championships at the age of 24, and he had regained the world number one ranking. But early the next season, he broke his ankle playing soccer and subsequently missed most of 2015.\n\n\"This time last year [my expectations] were through the roof coming off a great season, winning those back-to-back majors and although I started well I never felt I really got into my stride with the injuries and stuff,\" he said.\n\nMcIlroy's fluke ankle injury early into last season somewhat muddles his theory that the pressure makes it especially difficult to play well in a year after winning multiple majors; prior to his injury McIlroy had finished in the top-10 in both the Masters and U.S. Open, and certainly didn't appear to be suffering from any sort of hangover.\n\nStill, who knows whether or not Spieth will live up to his own expectations, or if the expectations of a golfer coming off multiple majors are ever really attainable. McIlroy, meanwhile, is currently ranked no. 3 in the world and as healthy as he's been since 2014. If nothing else, this could be the year we get to see Spieth and McIlroy \u2014 Golf's Bright Future(s) \u2014 finally go at it.\n\nNOW WATCH: President Obama sunk an awesome golf shot on vacation"}
