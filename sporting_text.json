{"LSU vs. Texas Tech betting lines and pick \u2013 Tigers have conference history on their side in Texas Bowl": "The first of three SEC-Big 12 bowl game matchups takes place on Tuesday (9 p.m. ET, ESPN) when No. 20 LSU and Texas Tech tangle in the AdvoCare V100 Texas Bowl at NRG Stadium in Houston. The SEC has dominated the Big 12 in postseason play when the betting market expects it to win, going 15-2 SU and 14-3 ATS in the last 17 meetings as favorites.\n\nLine: LSU -7, Total: 73.5\n\nLine movement: The Wynn opened LSU as 7.5-point favorites on Dec. 7 with early-bird bettors snapping up the hook within hours and pushing the line to -7. The Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook dangled -5.5 as its initial offer but adjusted to -7 within 24 hours. The line has pretty much stayed at a touchdown since, but underdog bettors could find +7.5 at MGM the day before kickoff. The total is offered between 73.5 and 74.5 across Vegas. Visit our odds page for updated bowl game lines.\n\nTrends that matter: LSU is 6-14 ATS after allowing 20 points or less in its previous game....Texas Tech is 10-4-1 ATS in its last 15 games overall....The OVER is 7-1 in the Tigers' last eight games following a SU victory....The OVER is 13-3 in the Red Raiders' last 16 neutral-site games.\n\nBy the numbers: Tigers vs. Red Raiders\n\nLSU outlook (8-3 SU, 4-6-1 ATS): LSU fans are hoping the Tigers stay on track following a 19-7 victory over Texas A&M in the Bayou to close the regular season, after losing three in a row SU and ATS to Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi.\n\nDefenses seemed to figure out LSU's offense at the end of the year: stuff the box, shut down RB Leonard Fournette \u2014 its best weapon \u2014 and force the less-than-dangerous Brandon Harris to throw. Though they faced some stouts units, LSU averaged only 16.5 points in its last four games (opposed to 38.9 before) and did not score over 20 in any of them. Harris' passing attempts jumped to 31.5 per game during the stretch from 18.4 prior.\n\nThe good news for LSU bettors is that Texas Tech pretty much shuns defense, and is one of the worst run stoppers in college football. Its 42.4 points and 531.4 total yards per game to FBS opponents ranks 124th and 125th, respectively. Moreover, it allows 267.7 rushing yards per contest (124th) at 5.8 per carry (125th). On the season, when LSU faces a team allowing more than 130 rushing yards per game, it is 4-1 ATS versus 0-5-1 against the number to those yielding less.\n\nOn D, the Tigers will be challenged by one of the nation's most high-powered (46.6 points per game) and quickest offenses (83.5 plays per game), an attack and pace they've rarely faced in the SEC. Establishing the run game will likely be LSU's best defense.\n\nMore on the Tigers: Stats and trends\n\nTexas Tech outlook (7-5 SU, 7-4-1 ATS): The Red Raiders employ an air-raid offense, throwing the ball 56.5 percent of the time from the shotgun position, ninth most nationally. Although Tech picks up 207 yards per game on the ground, the passing attack is primary, and how well defenses hold up to it is critical to the Raiders' success. Against teams yielding 6.7 or more yards per passing attempt on the season, coach Kliff Kingsbury's squad is 5-1 SU and ATS. It is 1-4 SU and 2-3 ATS against teams under that threshold. LSU enters the contest yielding 6.5.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the Red Raiders defense is pretty atrocious. But they do one thing fairly well that may help them in this contest: force turnovers. They pick it off on 3.3 percent of opposing quarterback dropbacks (41st in the nation) and generate 1.8 takeaways per contest. Winning the turnover battle gives football teams a chance in nearly every game.\n\nMore on the Red Raiders: Stats and trends\n\nPick: LSU is deep and talented enough on defense to rotate guys and stay fresh against the Red Raiders' assault. Fournette will likely have a huge day, and the SN staff figures the Tigers to win by more than a touchdown. We'd like to see the number drift below a -7 again, and it may, but we'll lay the touchdown if we have to.\n\nPlay Gamblino for free and win a $1,500 entry into the world's largest sports betting competition, The SuperContest.", "\u200bCalifornia vs. Air Force betting lines and pick \u2013 Cal favorite in Armed Forces Bowl": "One will not find two more contrasting styles among college football teams than Cal and Air Force, which meet in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl on Tuesday (2 p.m. ET, ESPN). Coach Sonny Dykes employs an air-raid offense, with the Golden Bears passing the ball on 57 percent of plays (fifth most in the nation). The Falcons' triple-option attack rushes the ball on 82 percent of snaps (fourth-most). Which offense executes the best will most likely determine the winner.\n\nLine: Cal -7, Total: 67.5\n\nLine movement: The Wynn opened Cal as a 6.5-point favorite, moving to -7 within 24 hours of trading. About 24 hours before kickoff, most Vegas books were dealing -7, while MGM Resorts was at -6.5. The total opened 63 offshore and has been bet up to 67.5 and 68 at most outlets. Visit our odds page for updated bowl numbers.\n\nTrends that matter: Cal is 0-5 ATS in its last five against a team with a winning record\u2026.Air Force is 8-2 ATS in its last ten versus a team with a winning record\u2026.The OVER is 4-0 in the Falcons\u2019 last four games\u2026.The UNDER is 8-1 in Cal\u2019s last nine against a team with a winning record.\n\nBy the numbers: Golden Bears vs. Falcons\n\nCal outlook (7-5 SU, 5-7 ATS): Jared Goff leads Cal\u2019s passing attack. The first-team All-Pac-12 junior might be the first quarterback taken in this year\u2019s NFL Draft if he decides to declare (insiders expect he will). Goff set school records for passing yards (4,252) and passing touchdowns (37) this season. Altogether, he heads up an offense generating 512 total yards per game against FBS foes, 10th most nationally.\n\nThe defense covers a lot of ground, too, but on the back foot. Its 469.7 total yards allowed per contest ranks 110th worst in college football. It was particularly bad in the red zone, yielding the nation\u2019s highest scoring rate inside the 20 by holding FBS opponents without a point just three percent of the time.\n\nCal was the nation\u2019s leader in takeaways through the first six games, but it virtually dried up afterwards. Its 1.2 turnovers forced per game ranks 101st nationally.\n\nThe D\u2019s 202.8 rushing yards allowed per game may hurt them the most against Air Force, though.\n\nMore on the Golden Bears: Stats and trends\n\nAir Force outlook (8-5 SU, 9-4 ATS): The Falcons' 321.8 rushing yards per game is third-best in the nation, and their 5.4 yards per attempt is 12th. It is a team effort, with seven runners gaining 300 yards or more on the season. The unit's dependence on the run makes it difficult for them to come from behind, though. All five of Air Force's losses came after it trailed at halftime, and the Falcons were leading at half in all their wins.\n\nThe defense benefits from the offense's ability to manufacture long drives, but still is subpar at slowing opponents. It yields a middling 4.5 rushing yards (72nd) and 7.2 passing yards (66th) per attempt against FBS opponents.\n\nMore on the Falcons: Stats and trends\n\nPick: Despite Goff\u2019s prowess, Cal's offense rarely matched Vegas\u2019 expectations, scoring above its team total in just three games all season. Part of this is the Ds inability to stop the run, which ultimately keeps the ball out of his dangerous hands. Air Force should be able to produce on the ground, despite the talent gap between the teams. The SN staff will go against the line movement and play the UNDER 67.5 with a small lean to the Falcons +7.\n\nPlay Gamblino for free and win a $1,500 entry into the world's largest sports betting competition, The SuperContest.", "Baylor vs. UNC betting line and pick \u2014 Bears' injuries swing line in big way": "If you're reading this, it may already be too late. A flood of Baylor injuries have crippled the Bears' offense and swung this line about seven points since it opened.\n\nThe Tar Heels are now a 3.5-point favorite in the Russell Athletic Bowl on Tuesday (5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN).\n\nMORE: UNC-Baylor matchup page\n\nLine: UNC -3.5 Total: 69.5\n\nLine movement: Baylor opened -3.5 or -3 at most shops, and as the injuries and confirmations trickled down, it moved to a pick'em, then alway the way to North Carolina -3.5. Check out our live odds page for updated numbers from Las Vegas.\n\nTrends that matter: The UNDER is 1-3-1 in bowl games between the Big 12 and ACC in five games since 2008. Baylor went 7-5 on the OVER this season, UNC 7-6.\n\nUNC outlook: The Tar Heels finally broke out under Larry Fedora, and defensive coordinator Gene Chizik had a lot to do with that. UNC lost just twice, a dominating effort packed with two bad turnovers in its season-opener against South Carolina and in the ACC Championship Game against Clemson in a nail-biter.\n\nThis offense was as good as expected, with QB Marquise Williams averaging 8.2 yards per attempt and RB Elijah Hood gaining 6.5 yards per carry (1,345 overall) and 17 TDs. UNC's offense led the nation at 7.2 yards per play.\n\nDefensively, the Heels allowed 5.3 yars per play and ranked 56th in FBS per Football Outsiders. That's a big step up from year's past, when the defense seemed to hold them back.\n\nMORE: UNC stats and trends\n\nBaylor outlook: Baylor will be without its top receiver, running back and top two quarterbacks in this game. Chris Johnson will start at QB for the Bears, and he struggled mightily in limited time down the stretch. Against TCU, he went 7 of 24 for 62 yards with one TD and one pick. Against Texas, in a 23-17 loss as three-touchdown favorites, the Bears went away from the pass completely. Johnson went 3 of 4 for 20 yards.\n\nWe could talk all about Baylor's monster offensive numbers this season, but the Bears will be a completely different team without QBs Seth Russell and Jarrett Stidham, WR Corey Coleman and RB Shock Linwood. Art Briles' offense usually hums no matter who is under center, but that wasn't the case in the final two weeks of the season.\n\nBaylor's defense allowed 4.9 yards per play this season, 30th in the nation, and ranked 28th in efficiency, per Football Outsiders. So while the offense gets much of the credit for this team's success, this defense can hang with the best of them, too.\n\nMORE: Baylor stats and trends\n\nPick: Per Sports Insights, about 75 percent of spread bets have come in on North Carolina. If you haven't bet UNC yet, you missed the best price and most of the value, though they're a much healthier side at the moment and seem to be in much better form.\n\nAbout 80 percent of bettors are on the over. Baylor's last four bowl games under Art Briles have seen at least 75 points, but with the offense struggling mightily and both defenses better than perceived, we'll throw out a play on the UNDER at 69.5 or better.", "Bengals at Broncos props, odds and picks \u2013 Quarterback projections prompt wagers": "Fantasy Alarm's Week 16 player projections suggest Bengals QB AJ McCarron and Broncos signal caller Brock Osweiler present value if wagering on Las Vegas props for Monday night's (8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) Cincinnati-Denver contest.\n\nThe Broncos are 3.5-point favorites to win, with a total at 39.5.

The two conferences will meet for the only time this bowl season in the Quick Lane Bowl (5 p.m. ET, ESPN2) on Monday when Minnesota takes on Central Michigan at Ford Field in Detroit.\n\nMinnesota went just 5-7 SU, but without enough 6-6 or better teams to fill every bowl game, the Golden Gophers reached the postseason thanks to its strong academic progress rate (APR).\n\nMORE: CMU-Minnesota matchup page\n\nLine: Minnesota -5, Total: 48.5\n\nLine movement: Minnesota opened at either -6 or -6.5 Vegas-wide, but was bet down to -5 at most spots the morning of the game.

Check out our live odds page for updated numbers from Las Vegas.\n\nTrends that matter: Big Ten teams went 10-2 straight-up against MAC teams this season, but just 2-10 ATS; UNDERs went 7-5 in those matchups....Central Michigan's last five bowl games have been decided by three points or fewer....The Gophers finished the season on 4-1 ATS run, but just one came as a favorite.\n\nCentral Michigan outlook (7-5 SU, 9-3 ATS): The Chippewas went 9-3 ATS this season, but the numbers caught up to them a bit by the end of the year, finishing 2-3 ATS after a 7-0 start vs. the number.\n\nCMU is led by a stellar passing attack under QB Cooper Rush. The Chips were among the worst rushing teams in FBS, per Football Study Hall, but average 8.0 yards per pass attempt. Rush threw 25 TDs and 10 INTs while completing 67 percent of his passes and has a good company of weapons available. The Chips ran a higher percentage of passing plays than all but 11 FBS teams, but were 60th in plays per game, so this isn't a hurry-up, push-the-pace offense.\n\nThe CMU defense was actually its stronger unit, allowing 5.3 yards per play and ranking 58th in defensive efficiency, per Football Outsiders.\n\nMORE: Central Michigan stats and trends\n\nMinnesota outlook (5-7 SU, 6-6 ATS): The Gophers lost to five ranked opponents and dropped three games by six points or fewer. They had some of the worst turnover luck in the country, as well. Football Study Hall rates them 35th (per-play), while Football Outsiders (per-drive) has them 73rd, 12 spots behind Central Michigan.\n\nCoach Jerry Kill retired at the end of October for health reasons, and long-time confidant Tracy Claeys took his place. Minnesota covered four of its final five games under Claeys after starting 2-5 ATS. There could be a bit of a motivational lull for the Gophers playing in Detroit against a perceived inferior opponent, but Claeys should have this team ready to go.\n\nQB Mitch Leidner had a disappointing season, completing 57 percent of his passes at 6.1 yards per attempt. The Gophers offense averaged 5.2 yards per play, but 6.1 over its last three games.\n\nMinnesota's only All-Big Ten players came in the secondary, and the Gophers allowed 6.0 yards per pass attempt, 18th in FBS. Their passer-rating against was 26th. So Minny has the defensive prowess (55th in overall efficiency), especially in the back, to slow CMU's passing attack.\n\nMORE: Minnesota stats and trends\n\nPick: Kill has been in and out of the program over the last few years while battling heart troubles, and Claeys has done excellent in his place. This team was motivated and winning to close the season under him. Central Michigan did well in John Bonamego's first year, but may have peaked a little early.\n\nExpect Minnesota to be ready despite the lackluster destination \u2014 at 5-7, the Gophers should want to prove they belong in the postseason. Gophers -5 or better is the play from the SN staff, though if you like Central Michigan, we recommend taking the moneyline, since it's possible Minnesota elects to not show up. We'll also throw out a play on the UNDER at 49 or better, since Minnesota should slow down CMU's passing attack, and the Gophers offense has been sluggish all year.

The Westgate moved from -1.5 to -3 (even) by Monday morning, while The Wynn adjusted to -2.5 on Sunday night.\n\nBucs at Panthers (-10, 47)\n\nThe Westgate opened Carolina -9.5 and moved to -10 after 40 minutes of wagering. CG Technology came a bit higher at -10.5. The Panthers are still playing for the top seed in the NFC, as they\u2019re just a game ahead of the Cardinals.\n\nPatriots (-9) at Dolphins\n\nNew England opened -8 at the Westgate, but the sports book joined other shops at -9 in Sunday night wagering. Underdog bettors take note: the Pats were -8 at home against the Dolphins in Week 8 in a 36-7 win.\n\nRavens at Bengals (-7)\n\nWhether they win or lose Monday night in Denver, the Bengals will have plenty of incentive at home vs. the Ravens next week.\n\nSaints at Falcons (-2)\n\nThis line should get the attention of favorite bettors since Atlanta was bigger chalk (-3) when these teams played in New Orleans in Week 6.
